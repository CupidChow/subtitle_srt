1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,560
Hello. Hello.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,080
Fang Jie.

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,640
We have two happy events today

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
Let’s toast to Mr. Jin.

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Don’t spoil her

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
don't spoil her.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,920
No problem.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Mr. Jin.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,680
Happy birthday.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,040
A toast to you.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,120
Okay.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,640
Happy birthday.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,840
You look so pretty today.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,640
Happy wedding.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,960
Excuse me.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,160
What took you so long?

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,200
It's your father's birthday.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
Why are you pulling a long face?

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,200
Jin Yetlei.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
Let me tell you.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,080
Even if you don't recognize me,

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
you have to accept our marriage certificate.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,080
and the one in my belly.

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
This morning,

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,039
Lei and Shaking have got married.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Don't think too much.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
He's an adult.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
No matter what,

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
this is his final choice.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,680
After today,

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640
after today?

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm not acting for others.

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,560
There's something disgusting about Jenny.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
Wang Simyeon.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,079
Business society.

37
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,640
Honesty comes first.

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,440
Here.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,680
So,

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
you can't run away.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Lei,

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Stop drinking.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
You're acting like someone owes you money.

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
Lei,

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,760
I’m happy today.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,240
Mr. Jin.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,840
Hello.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,440
Long time no see, Mr. Feng.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,680
It's the first time I've seen you bring a female partner.

50
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
So beautiful.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,400
What a perfect match.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Thank you.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,920
This is...

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,320
He brought a girlfriend.

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
I guess she's your girlfriend.

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
They look great together.

57
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes.

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,320
Look, they look like a couple.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,040
and elegant.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,120
So nice.

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,480
This woman...

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,640
I don't know.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,440
Are they a couple?

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Brother.

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,640
Happy birthday.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,400
I wish you

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,440
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,280
Wish you a happy life.

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,480
Okay.

70
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,440
Lei,

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Let's have a drink together.

72
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,360
Xin-ni.

73
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,200
Dad.

74
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey.

75
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,040
Suyeon.

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
We have two happy events today.

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,440
Thank you for coming to congratulate

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,840
for getting married with Lei

79
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,440
Lei Lei

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,280
From now on

81
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
you're going to call Xiao Lei

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,040
Brother-in-law.

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Congratulations.

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,960
From now on,

85
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,640
you should call me auntie.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,800
Today is a happy day.

87
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,840
Auntie.

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,760
Three good things are coming.

89
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,920
Brother.

90
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,160
I forgot to introduce you.

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,440
This is...

92
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,320
My girlfriend.

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,079
Shin-yeon.

94
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,880
Girlfriend?

95
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,040
This is the first time.

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,320
You...

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
[I'll be with you.]

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
Shin-yeon and I

99
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
will get married soon.

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Good news.

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,040
It's a good thing.

102
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
It's worth a drink.

103
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,120
Today is the third joy.

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
It's more worth a drink.

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,200
Let's drink.

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,840
Cheers.

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,520
Mom.

108
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,320
That bitch came to disgust me

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,800
He seduced Lei first.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,080
Now he seduces uncle

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,640
and be my aunt.

112
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,680
Is she interested in the money of the Jin family?

113
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,840
She wants my money.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
Calm down.

115
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
The show is coming.

116
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,200
Hello, everyone.

117
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,280
Today is my birthday.

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Thank you

119
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
for coming to my birthday party.

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,640
It feels like being called auntie

121
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,000
Not bad

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Thank you, everyone.

123
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,160
I'm used to being called uncle.

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm used to it.

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Today

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,440
a chance

127
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,120
Please gather together.

128
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
Next,

129
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
I want to

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,280
to you.

131
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,560
Then...

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Oh

133
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,000
So lively

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh.

135
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Sorry.

136
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm late.

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
Oh.

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
What a nice view

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,040
There are mountains and rivers.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Look here

141
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,159
So many delicious food

142
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,720
It's nice

143
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,640
This must be my future son-in-law.

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
He's so handsome.

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,120
Nice

146
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
With this son-in-law,

147
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
I won't worry.

148
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
So handsome.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,440
Auntie.

150
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,760
Here.

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Have a seat.

152
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,040
Okay.

153
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,640
Have a seat.

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
Who is this distinguished guest?

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,720
You must be my future in-law.

156
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I bought you some fruits.

157
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,000
Take it.

158
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,320
Happy birthday.

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,720
This fruit

160
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
I just bought them outside.

161
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,280
It's fresh.

162
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Thank you

163
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,760
for raising such an excellent son.

164
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll drink first.

165
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,760
Thank you.

166
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,520
Mom.

167
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Stop drinking.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,440
Mr. Jin.

169
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,800
I’m really sorry.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,320
Let's go.

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,040
Let's go back first.

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,680
Let's go back.

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,440
What are you doing?

174
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
My butt is still warm.

175
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,960
I haven't eaten yet.

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,680
Enjoy yourselves.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
Sorry.

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,640
Sit down.

179
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Why are you pulling me?

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
This is someone else's family matter.

181
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,520
Slow down.

182
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
Where are you going?

183
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,440
Seriously.

184
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
What are you doing?

185
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,800
You are...

186
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,040
Let go of me!

187
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,360
What are you doing?

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Why are you here?

189
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,160
Who told you that?

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,960
Who?

191
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,040
No one.

192
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,960
2 Circles.

193
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,680
I win again.

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
Take the money.

195
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,000
Why is it 100 yuan?

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
Wait for me.

197
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm going out to get some money.

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,600
Buy some drinks.

199
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,919
