1
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,000
If you want to take advantage of the Jin family, you'll be able to take advantage of them. If you want to take advantage of them, you'll be able to take advantage of them.

2
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,240
to deal with the Xie family,

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
Why didn't you choose me?

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Just some who turn into cats

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,400
Become a tiger

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,080
and become a dog wet by the rain.

7
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
Don’t tell me you don’t understand

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,040
Or do you understand?

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,880
Wang Simyeon.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,880
No matter what you want to do,

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,920
I will never allow you to hurt Lei.

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,720
As his uncle,

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
your concern for your nephew

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,039
is too unusual.

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,880
An illegitimate child?

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,960
An illegitimate child is a bastard.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
I just don't know who my parents are.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,039
Am I right, illegitimate child?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,880
Look at him.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
You bastard!

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
What are you doing?

22
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,160
Watch your mouth.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
An illegitimate child.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm glad it wasn't on my face today.

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,920
how to explain to my dad.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
No wonder I couldn't find it this morning.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,320
My badge.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,200
Why do you have it?

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
Just let me wear it.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,919
Why?

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
This

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,039
Because

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Give it back if you don't tell me.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,000
Today is our first day in high school.

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,720
We don't know each other anyway.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,520
How about this?

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
I'll be Jin Xueyan from now on.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
and you will be Jin Yetlei.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
you won’t be bullied.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
But in that case,

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
Aren't you afraid of being called an illegitimate child?

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm not afraid.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm not.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
No matter how they scold me,

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm not.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
From now on,

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,320
don't act on your own

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
and bear these for me.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm not afraid of being criticized.

52
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,200
It's enough that I have you.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
So cheesy.

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
You're not.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,520
Everyone has a different definition of family.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
My family

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,600
No one can bully me.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
Pick me as your teammate.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
is better than being an enemy.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,040
But if you want to be my stumbling block,

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't mind wasting my energy

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
to move you away.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Thank you.

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,280
From the perspective of management,

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,840
The goal of business management

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
is to achieve this goal.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Management Mission.

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,120
It's not about managing the company.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
but to ensure

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,640
Lei Lei

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
Are you free tonight?

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,320
Let's

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
have a meal together?

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Repeat.

75
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,320
What did I just say?

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,760
Sir.

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
Are you talking about

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,440
Objects?

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Cai.

80
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,360
Message.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,920
Target.

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,720
These five basic elements

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
These five basic elements

84
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
are formed.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
operation,

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
The system is...

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,760
is not as serious as an assistant.

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,880
What?

89
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,600
You don't want to join Minglan anymore?

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Who are you to tell me what to do?

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,200
You're just a teacher my mom hired.

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,000
Take the money.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Be good.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Cooperate with me.

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
I promise you'll make money comfortably.

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Hello?

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Ms. Du.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,520
Xinni wants to report to you about your study.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,040
Here.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
[Information]

101
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
[Target]

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Target.

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,280
Five basic elements.

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,640
of five basic elements.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Ms. Du,

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,080
Don’t worry.

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,520
I'll teach her well.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's continue.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,880
I asked you to study more seriously than me.

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,159
Does it hurt?

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,240
No.

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
but to ensure the survival of the company.

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
If you make a sound,

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,480
I'll strangle you to death.

115
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
Management is a decision.

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,000
Coordination.

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,040
Class dismissed.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
Rest for 145 seconds.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
Thank you.

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,520
Sister.

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,280
I transferred the medical fee to you.

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
At your age,

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
it's lucky

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,560
to make so much money.

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
I gave you a chance.

127
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,960
So,

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
you will cherish this job opportunity.

129
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,200
right?

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
When my mom asks you

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,080
I know what to say.

132
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
So what if you're rich?

133
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Only you have money, right?

134
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,000
Money can bully others.

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
Money can bully others.

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
Money can scold others.

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Money can bully others.

138
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
Our boxing club is big.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
These equipment

140
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,560
are also purchased this year.

141
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,400
What are you looking at?

142
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Do you like aerobic exercise like running?

143
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,320
or resistance exercise?

144
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
Did you have a coach before?

145
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
No.

146
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,800
I can arrange a coach

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
to give you an experience lesson.

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,440
Thank you so much.

149
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,360
I...

150
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Go get changed.

151
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,640
This way, please.

152
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,680
Thank you.

153
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,080
Hello.

154
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,240
Mr. Lin.

155
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm Xinyan.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,280
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.

157
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
I have an appointment with Mr. Jin to the gallery.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes.

159
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,159
By then,

160
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,560
Mr. Lin,

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
help me out.

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,040
Take out your most expensive painting.

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,920
As usual.

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,360
One painting.

165
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll draw 10%.

166
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,800
Mr. Lin, please put in a good word for me.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
Mr. Jin is good-looking

168
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,520
and from a good family.

169
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

170
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
Sure.

171
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,360
Mr. Lin.

172
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.

173
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,320
See you.

174
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
The Cyber City Project.

175
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
How long do we have to wait?

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Soon.

177
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
As long as Xin Ni enters Minglan,

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,400
the Cyber City project will be initiated on time.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,080
Time

180
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
is money.

181
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,799
Let's eat first.

182
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm not hungry.

183
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm going to work.

184
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,360
Okay.

185
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,800
Hello, Xinni

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Lei Lei

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Can you accompany me

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,280
with me tomorrow?

189
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,160
Not tomorrow.

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,640
I have work tomorrow.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,920
You should go to class too.

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
If the Cyber City plan continues,

193
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,400
it will be bad.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,480
Bye.

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
I heard that

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,800
she's going to the gallery with Mr. Jin tomorrow.

197
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
These paintings are pretty.

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
But I don't understand at all.

199
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Mr. Lin asked

200
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,720
to understand his painting

201
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,360
to visit his chateau?

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
Mr. Lin said

203
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
only by understanding his painting

204
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
to understand his wine.

205
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,520
Let's go.

206
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,160
Look at the painting.

207
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,080
Mr. Lin is over there.

208
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,960
I don't know much about painting.

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
But I did some research.

210
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,920
This is Mr. Lin's favorite painting.

211
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Just praise him

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400

213

215
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,160

217

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Don't be so nervous.

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm really nervous.

222
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,800
I forgot again

223
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Jackson what

224
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,600
Jackson Polo

225
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You don't deserve it

226
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,520

227
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Xinni.

228
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,120
Why are you here?

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
You're talking about smallpox.

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,760
It's just splashing the paint.

231
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
Even elementary school kids can make it.

232
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,000
How dare you take it out?

233
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,000
Xinni.

234
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,120
Am I wrong?

235
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480

236
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,800

237
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,640
We don't welcome excellent people.

238
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,520
What?

239
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
You can only get compliments

240
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,000
to cheat people who don't understand.

241
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
We never force people to buy paintings.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,640
Please get out.

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,320
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

244
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,120
Xinni.

245
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,160
You don't know the situation.

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,400
We're talking about something serious.

247
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,600
What serious?

248
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
I heard everything.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
This bitch said it herself.

250
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,280
They are in cahoots.

251
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,360
They want to trick you into buying paintings,

252
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
and seduce you.

253
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Miss Xie.

254
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
What are you talking about?

255
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,040
Xinni, you misunderstood Miss Wang.

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,960
We're not...

257
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
No one lied to me.

258
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400

I'm your fiancée.

262
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Xinni.

263
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,560
There's an occasion to be jealous.
