1
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,280
The patient

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,640
is not feeling well.

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,240
He drank too much.

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,640
causing excessive blood pressure

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,680
causing severe brain hemorrhage.

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
As his family,

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
be mentally prepared.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
He may

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,640
wake up.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,440
What did you do?

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,840
What can I do?

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,440
Your dad is always drunk.

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,800
He doesn't even go home.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,479
What can I do?

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,080
Look at him now.

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm sad too.

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
If we don't hold the wedding,

19
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,120
you won't look good in a wedding dress.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Do you know your dad is in hospital?

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Yes.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
My mom told me

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,600
it's nothing serious.

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,880
I won't die.

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,280
Besides,

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,360
I have a baby now.

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
If I go to the hospital,

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,880
if I go to the hospital

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Lei Lei

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,079
Let's get married

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,720
I have my eyes on several wedding dresses.

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,040
My belly is big anyway.

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,040
It's the same after the delivery

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
It's not the same

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,520
Your body will be different then.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,800
What's your attitude?

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,840
Lei.

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
Where are you going?

39
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,840
Chairman.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,520
The Cyber City Project

41
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
We didn’t have enough cash.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,560
So I used

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
a charity fund.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,040
I was going to fill it up soon.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,280
I didn't have time.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Will Xyan make an article about this?

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,040
Maybe.

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Actually,

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,840
this money involves

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,040
of the charity auction.

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,280
Strictly speaking,

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
this money

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,520
is not the personal property of Jin’s Group.

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
How long will it take?

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,000
I need an exact time.

56
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,279
Next month.

57
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
It will work.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,760
Mom.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
I heard something today.

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,520
Can you help me

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
to control Lei?

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
I want him to get married with me as soon as possible.

63
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
Xinni.

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,760
You need to know what's important.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
There's nothing more important

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
is more important than giving birth smoothly.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't think about that.

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,680
I'll take care of it later.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
Kids nowadays

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
are so troublesome.

71
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
Cut the crap.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
Jang Chun-pil.

73
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
You ask me for money every day.

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
What do you want?

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,040
Mr. Du.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
Your family is rich.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
I only asked you a few times.

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,840
It's not as much as your family's monthly expenses.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
I hope

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,880
this is the last time.

81
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Jang Chun-pil is more greedy than we thought.

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,040
Soon,

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,520
they will bite each other.

84
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,560
Keep a close eye on them these days.

85
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
You reek of alcohol.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
Why don't you take a shower first?

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,640
Lei Lei

88
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Do you know

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,760
it's illegal for your dad to embezzle public funds?

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,040
Does our group

91
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
to embezzle public funds?

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,400
Believe me.

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
I just heard it today.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,120
Are you listening to me?

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,040
I've had enough of Jin Yetlei.

96
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
Why are you pulling a long face?

97
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
I asked you to hold a wedding but you didn't.

98
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
You're always like this.

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
I don't owe you anything.

100
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,240
I'll ask you one last time.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
Are you going to hold the wedding?

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Will you?

103
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
I said I won't do it.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
Can't you stop?

105
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
If you refuse,

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,040
I'll post your dad's embezzlement

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
on the Internet.

108
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,920
Crazy.

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,000
Jin Yetlei.

110
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
Chairman.

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Chairman!

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,159
Something happened.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
About the money...

114
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,400
Why is it so noisy?

115
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
What's going on?

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,320
Previously...

117
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,800
What's wrong?

118
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,600
Hurry!

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Call 120.

120
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Hurry up.

121
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
I'll get you some medicine.

122
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,160
What's wrong?

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,920
Did you spread

124
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
the news online?

125
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,400
How do you feel?

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,120
Brother.

127
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
How are you feeling

128
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
TOCT...

129
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm still alive.

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,960
It's just a close call to death.

131
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't worry.

132
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,280
I knew something was wrong

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
I thought something was wrong.

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,640
I've dealt with it.

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
What matters now

136
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Press the sound outside

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
and issue the statement as soon as possible.

138
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,360
Okay.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,200
I'll leave it to you.

140
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll take care of it.

141
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,280
Brother.

142
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,840
Rest assured.

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Uncle.

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,680
Let's go.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,840
This house doesn't like me.

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't want to stay.

147
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,160
Mr. Wang.

148
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Three minutes.

149
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
Drive the car to the door.

150
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
I don't want you to tell me.

151
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
In my opinion,

152
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,960
Hurry up.

153
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
I don't want to stay in this house for a second.

154
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,640
Useless!

155
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,960
He's usually drunk and unconscious.

156
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Hello?

157
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Miss Wang.

158
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm Jang Chun-pil.

159
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,080
Can you come and see me?

160
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,880
Where are you?

161
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
I'll be right there.

162
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,440
Okay.

163
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
I’ll send you the address.

164
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
Zhang Chunji failed to blackmail me.

165
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
Du Lan forced him to jump off the wall.

166
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,800
and asked to meet me.

167
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
