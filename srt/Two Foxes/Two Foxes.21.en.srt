1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,200
It's like this. It's like this.

2
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,120
I don't know.

4
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,320
Zhang Chunji.

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,080
Or should I call you Li Guixiang now?

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm Li Gui Xiang.

7
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,720
I'm not Jang Chun-pil.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,560
Don’t deny it.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
I saw you in the Xie family.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,800
You got the wrong person.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,160
Here.

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,080
Be careful.

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,039
I'm fine.

14
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,039
This old man

15
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,120
is looking for trouble.

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,960
Be careful.

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,320
What's wrong?

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,080
Nothing.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,759
What a coincidence!

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,800
She asked for leave at home.

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,160
because she's afraid

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,680
we go to her employer's house to make trouble?

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,560
Look at her reaction.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
She clearly knows we're following her.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,400
Slow down.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
You can stop here.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Don't you have to go to work?

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Be careful.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
Do you still have money?

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,440
Mom.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Don't you have a salary?

32
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,840
Why do you keep asking me for money?

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
I don't even have money to get married.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,560
I bought you your favorite ribs.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,320
Take it back.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,040
No.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,880
You pass by your brother's shop at work.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Give it to him.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Why didn't you tell me?

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,240
Are you going to say I'm biased again?

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
Why don't you take any loss?

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,840
You know I'm at a disadvantage.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,480
Son.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,240
Son.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
How have you been these days?

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,600
I'm fine.

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,200
Son.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Take care of yourself no matter how busy you are.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Did you bring the money?

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,079
Anything else?

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
No.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,440
I really don't have any.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,800
Ask my sister for more.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,680
I've asked your sister for it.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,760
She's gone too.

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
I have no choice.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,800
That's all, son.

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
Jang Chun-pil values her son so much.

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
Her daughter will make a scene if she knows.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,520
Why don't we make Chi-zi more confused?

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,480
I'm leaving, mom.

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Did you win

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,640
Did you win?

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,720
No.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Time's up.

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,720
She should get off work.

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,640
Give it back to me.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Put it down.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,240
What are you doing?

70
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
Put it down.

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,640
All these years,

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,400
you kept asking me for money.

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,120
And then?

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,160
I gave the money to my brother.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,040
How could you be so biased?

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,040
Zhang Chunji did so much for Du Lan.

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,440
He shouldn’t be short of money.

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,560
Why am I in such a mess?

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
I looked into her son's financial situation.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
and owed a lot of external debts.

81
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
Zhang Chunji spent all his money

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,159
for this son.

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
You can't take it if you buy it.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
If you buy it...

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't take it away.

86
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,840
Why?

87
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,240
I bought this.

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,000
Give it back to me.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Since she is so short of money,

90
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,240
should we remind her

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
not to leave Jinshan behind.

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
Let them bite the dog.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,640
the evidence

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,640
the evidence.

95
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,360
Du Lan, a famous entrepreneur.

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,920
Du Lan.

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
It’s her.

98
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
You must be tired.

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,040
Don't go upstairs.

100
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Go back and rest.

101
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,640
Okay.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,640
Rest early.

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,520
Mingcheng Community.

104
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Please

105
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
please come and have a look.

106
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Hello Fei

107
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Yes.

108
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,480
Ask the team

109
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,240
to help us.

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,680
Find someone.

111
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,520
Mingcheng Community.

112
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Captain.

113
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,000
How is it?

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,640
Did you find him?

115
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,400
The police confirmed

116
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,160
The car disappeared after this intersection.

117
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:54,960
But

118
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
There are several forks here.

119
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Please

120
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,240
Let's split up.

121
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,160
It saves time.

122
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,320
Boss.

123
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,760
Did you mobilize the rescue team?

124
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,560
I borrowed someone to look for someone.

125
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,920
Is she that important?

126
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,600
Yes.

127
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
Why don't you just give it to the police?

128
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,120
Besides,

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
this is not how we use our family’s public welfare power.

130
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
Besides, you’re looking for an unknown woman.

131
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,200
Simyeon is not an unknown person.

132
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
Xie’s illegitimate daughter.

133
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Brother.

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,440
I’m also an illegitimate son of the Jin family.

135
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,520
In your eyes,

136
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm also an unknown person?

137
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't give him

138
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
I really can't give you anything.

139
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
You're awake.

140
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Where am I?

141
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,920
On the boat.

142
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,800
They're selling us.

143
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
What should we do?

144
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,800
What should I do?

145
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm scared.

146
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,120
What should I do?

147
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,800
What should we do?

148
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
Do you want to escape?

149
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
Yes!

150
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Help!

151
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
Hello?

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Shut up!

153
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
Someone died.

154
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,080
Who's dead?

155
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
I'll kill you if you shout again.

156
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,880
I think she's really dead.

157
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm scared.

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Don't be afraid.

159
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
What are you doing?

160
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,360
Stop fighting!

161
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,320
Stop fighting!

162
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,880
I am...

163
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,240
Mr. Jin.

164
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,560
