1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,400
I'll give you one day.

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,680
I don't want to see

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,880
any news

4
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,960
that bitch bumped into me.

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,880
And...

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,520
Find that bitch.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,320
I didn't know she was here.

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
Go find her.

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,240
Look into it.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,360
Are you an idiot?

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
I transferred the medical fee to you.

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
Thank you.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,520
Anyway, I don't care.

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,160
Find that bitch.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Xinni.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,600
She's here.

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,000
Find her.

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Xinni.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
You miss me?

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,720
Don't you have to work today?

21
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
Of course.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,479
I thought you were still angry,

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
I asked you to have lunch.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
I don't mind

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
I don't care about it anymore.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm very generous.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,960
I have a headache. I still have a training class.

28
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,080
When will you finish?

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
The Cyber City Project

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,880
is waiting for you to enter Minglan.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,720
I don't want to hear it.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,920
I want something delicious.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,079
What do you want to eat?

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Anything.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Thank you for recommending Mr. Zhao to me.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,600
Otherwise, the sponsorship

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,160
will really end.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
It's so hard.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,920
Have you ever thought about

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
going back to the group?

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Yes.

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,480
Brother.

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,800
But I'm not interested

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,160
about the group.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,960
If you let me go back,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,920
I'll suffocate to death.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm doing what I like now.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,920
It's good.

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,400
People

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
should do something happy.

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,760
In charity,

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,920
if you need any help,

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,000
just let me know.

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,280
Okay. Bye.

55
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,360
Thank you.

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,400
OK.

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Mr. Jin.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,240
It’s you.

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,720
Look what I brought you.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,800
2018.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
in 2018.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,480
I only produced 1,000 bowls of wine.

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
I didn't keep it myself.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
The taste is really bad.

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
In terms of craftsmanship,

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,320
is not good.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
But I think it has highlights.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,480
What do you mean?

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
It's popular in China to keep grapes

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
in China.

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,440
The wine made like this

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
will have a special flavor.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,120
It has a similar taste

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,200
your style.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
You're right.

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,120
Why didn't I know you earlier?

77
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
It's not too late.

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
Let me introduce myself.

79
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,960
I’m the investment director of Zhaosheng Group.

80
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Xinyan Wang.

81
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,000
When we become partners with Mr. Jin,

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
we can communicate more

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
about wine.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Which project do you like?

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,120
Except the Cyber City Project,

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,960
Choose whatever you want.

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,800
Mr. Jin’s chateau.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,360
I was just kidding.

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
My family doesn't think highly of it.

90
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
That's because

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
you haven't met me before.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's talk about

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
about the sponsorship.

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,200
I didn't expect

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
the alcohol industry in China

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
has developed so well.

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
Director Wang.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Go visit my chateau some other day.

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
and give some suggestions.

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,800
Okay.

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,920
There is

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
on this.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Welcome, Director Wang.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
You can visit anytime.

105
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,160
I'll send someone to receive you.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,320
It's an honor.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Sorry to bother you today.

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,000
Mr. Jin.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,200
I’m leaving.

110
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
See you next time.

112
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Okay.

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,000
Lei,

114
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
Why are you in the office today?

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,320
I introduced

116
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
introduced the sponsor

117
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,800
to our rescue ship?

118
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
I'm here to thank him.

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,280
What?

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,120
What is this?

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Lei,

122
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,520
I have to remind you something.

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
The gold takes six minutes.

124
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Director Wang.

125
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,200
You dropped your earring in my office.

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Can we have dinner tomorrow?

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,760
Sorry, Mr. Jin.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,920
I’m late.

129
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Why are you here?

130
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm here to warn you.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
No matter how many prey you have,

132
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
no matter who they are.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
But please stay away from

134
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,800
as far as

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,960
as far as you can.

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,200
Uncle.

137
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,320
What a joke.

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
Why are you here?

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,320
Restaurant reception.

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
Let me introduce myself.

141
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,880
My name is Jin Xyan.

142
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,160
Since you tried so hard to get close to Lei,

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
you must have heard my name.

144
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,920
Sit.

145
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
Are you Jin Xyan?

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
Do you want to see my ID?

147
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,920
You look good.

148
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
You're not the first one

149
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,960
Jin Xueyan is a middle-aged man.

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,120
How well does steak taste?

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,920
Aren't you here to warn me?

152
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,120
I was entrusted

153
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,400
I have to be loyal.

154
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
You've tried so hard.

155
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
I can't let you down.

156
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
I personally recommend

157
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,800
I personally recommend

158
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,080
with steak.

159
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,840
Try it.

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
Sure.

161
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,400
Uncle.

162
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,760
Aren't you going to put it away?

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,160
Are you still looking forward to the next time?

164
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Will there be a next time?

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
Mr. Jin is such a gentleman.

166
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,520
Are you afraid I’ll mess with Mr. Jin again?

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,200
Or are you...

168
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
I just want this pair of earrings

169
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
to die on your ears forever.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
Director Wang.

171
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,360
You can mess with some people,

172
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,840
but some people

173
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,600
you will never touch them.

174
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,120
I don’t care what your purpose is.

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,520
don’t mess with our Jin family.

176
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
So,

177
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
Be good.

178
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Hold it, captain.

179
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
I got the information you asked me to check.

180
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
Let's take a photo.

181
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Kids.

182
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
A little to the right.

183
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Here.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,280
Okay.

185
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,400
Okay.

186
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Sit down.

187
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,640
Xin's Group Haibird Bank Foundation

188
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:56,640
Special proof.

189
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:57,920
Haibird Project 1 to help poor students start sailing.

190
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Aid certificate.

191
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,800
Excuse me.

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,960
Wait.

193
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
Can I talk to the person in charge of the Sea Birds Project?

194
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,640
Captain.

195
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
