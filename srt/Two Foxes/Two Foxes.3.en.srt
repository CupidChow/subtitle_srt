1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,920
Here you are. Thank you.

2
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
I made a new batch of wine in my chateau.

3
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,720
You must come and taste it for me.

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,960
Drink this wine.

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just drink it and keep quiet.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Okay.

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,320
Later.

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,240
I'll wait for you.

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,680
Drive safely.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
It's raining heavily.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,840
Bye.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,320
Mr. Jin.

13
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello.

14
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,200
Director Wang.

15
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,960
You're here.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
You looked so sad just now.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
Did something happen?

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,720
The newly brewed wine

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
I tried it.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
I think something is wrong.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Let me taste it for you.

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,880
Okay.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
How is it?

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,720
Isn't Ning not flexible enough?

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
It's not enough to catch your mouth.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,640
Okay.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
Looks like

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
waste again.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,360
The same batch of wine?

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
The failure rate is too high.

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you mind if I try them all?

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
I’d love to.

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Mr. Jin.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
Just call me Lei.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,440
Okay.

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,360
Lei,

37
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,240
With all due respect,

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,800
Go ahead.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
These wine

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,680
are made in traditional ways.

41
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,520
But they try to integrate in innovation and breakthroughs.

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,440
So I'm very stubborn.

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
Actually brewing wine

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,680
is the same as being a human.

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
or follow the rules

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,040
or be free

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
freely.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
If you don't lean on both sides

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,000
Lei,

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
I said too much.

51
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,160
No, no.

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,360
Sim-yeon.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
Your words

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
is so accurate.

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Looks like

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
will be wasted again.

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,040
Not necessarily.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,640
If

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
the wine wrapped with cosmetic care,

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,080
Maybe

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
will occupy a new business territory.

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,960
I never thought about this idea.

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,600
Tell me more.

64
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,520
Okay.

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
First,

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,760
these wine

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,159
are not extreme enough.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,480
So we need

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Lei,

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,840
Looks like you found someone to taste the wine.

71
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,560
Uncle.

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Simon just proposed a very good idea.

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,680
Director Wang.

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,080
Hello. Hello. Hello.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,800
We meet again.

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,280
What are you thinking?

77
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
An immature suggestion.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Lei,

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,760
There's a wine tasting party at nine tonight.

80
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
If you're free,

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,120
you can take a look.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,800
your wine.

83
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
for your wine

84
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
to look for inspiration.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll definitely go.

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Director Wang.

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't drink enough.

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
I plan to

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
tonight.

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm not going today.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,400
I have something to do.

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,120
See you.

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,480
See you.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,680
Director Wang.

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
I drank a lot today.

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
It's hard to get a taxi outside.

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,240
Let me give you a ride.

98
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,760
No.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Thank you.

100
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,800
OK.

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,320
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,960
Lei,

103
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll see her off.

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,880
Then you...

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,480
Slowly.

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,440
Okay.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,080
Wait for me.

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,200
It's raining heavily.

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,400
Director Wang.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
I remember our friendly conversation

111
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,960
It hasn't been that long.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
You're so disobedient.

113
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,360
As you can see,

114
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm just here to talk about work.

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,840
Besides,

116
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
I’ve left your dear nephew.

117
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,960
You don’t have to be wary of me like a thief.

118
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,440
Let me ask you.

119
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,480
What's going on

120
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,159
What's going on?

121
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,159
I won't go.

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
What could it be?

123
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,880
I told you

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
don’t mess with the Jin family easily.

125
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,200
Since you don’t want to listen,

126
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,320
find a way to get the car tomorrow.

127
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
Mr. Jin, do you want me to take your car?

128
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
No.

129
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,080
I can find a designated driver.

130
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
It cost a lot.

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
The rent of this car

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
a lot of money, right?

133
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Please.

134
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,480
Director Wang.

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,680
Mr. Jin.

136
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
You are Jin Yetlei’s uncle,

137
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
not my uncle.

138
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Am I mistaken?

139
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,320
I feel like you're trying to

140
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,640
trying to discipline me.

141
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Or is it a disease that all men have?

142
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,840
The smell of father is overflowing.

143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,120
Sorry.

144
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not free or in the mood.

145
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,280
to raise a niece.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
Are you

147
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
like me?

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
What makes you so confident?

149
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,120
The earrings.

150
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
And this time,

151
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
you didn’t expose me in front of Mr. Jin.

152
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,040
You still don’t admit it?

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Do you like me?

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
Wang Simyeon.

155
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,040
You've been educated for so many years.

156
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,760
Your postgraduate degree

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,920
and your brain

158
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,240
to study

159
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
these messy things?

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,520
You investigated me?

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,720
Mr. Jin,

162
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,040
You really care about me.

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
Only with my education background

164
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,600
you're more qualified to enter this fame and fortune field.

165
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,520
Anyway,

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,880
thank you for walking me home.

167
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
Wang Simyeon.

168
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,720
I warned you.

169
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,360
What do I need you for?

170
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,880
Let go!

171
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
How dare you steal it from me?

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,120
I...

173
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,760
What else do you have?

174
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
This one, right?

175
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Throw this away too.

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,880
Let go of me.

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Give it to me.

178
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Don't move.

179
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
Don't throw it away.

180
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
Can you

181
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,280
stop throwing it away?

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
How dare you steal it from me?

183
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,480
Stop it.

184
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,800
I asked you to ask your dad for money.

185
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
You don't want it?

186
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,000
Then don't celebrate.

187
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,200
Today,

188
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,680
Even if you throw everything away,

189
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
I won't ask him for a penny.

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,000
You want me to die, right?

191
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Why did I have a daughter like you?

192
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
You ungrateful bastard.

193
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Go get me a glass of water.

194
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,720
Sure.

195
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,640
You didn't listen.

196
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
