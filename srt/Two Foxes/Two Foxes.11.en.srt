1
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,240
I didn't expect

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,800
You're still young.

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,200
Why did you lie to me that you're an uncle?

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,400
You called me uncle right away.

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,120
I just didn't have time to deny it.

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
To Mr. Jin.

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,720
To Mr. Jin.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,640
To my future boss.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,039
I didn't expect that the person who held the umbrella for me

10
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,240
was the same person.

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,160
Did you recognize me?

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,600
But...

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,479
You recognized me but you didn't tell me.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

15
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,759
I'm afraid it'll be too late

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,520
It'll be too late if you don't tell me.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,960
Sim-yeon.

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
Are you disappointed

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,039
disappointed with me, right?

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm not disappointed.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm worried.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,920
I don't know what happened to you,

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
but I still think

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,759
with your talent and ability,

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
shouldn't be used for these things.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll ask you again as your uncle.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,680
What are you doing?

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
I'll take you somewhere.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,280
My brother, Xie Xuan.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,440
When he was seven,

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,760
I drowned at the beach.

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
I don't believe it was an accident.

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,640
Unfortunately, my mother took the money

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
and ended it hastily.

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
I can only find out the truth

36
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,400
through my own efforts.

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,320
for letting you down.

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
From the moment I decided to accept the Sea Bird Project,

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
I thought of everything today.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,680
Only by punishing them,

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
my life

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
is meaningful to live.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
I know him.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
Sister.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Heen.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Why did you buy me a gift on your birthday?

48
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,600
They gave me a lot of pocket money.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,960
Take it.

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
You should graduate early.

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,880
The Xie family treats me well.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,040
Aunt Du is holding a birthday party for me.

53
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,480
Happy birthday.

54
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,159
Sister.

55
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,000
Come back as soon as you graduate.

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,520
I can't hold on any longer.

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
They call me an illegitimate child every day.

58
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,120
I really miss you.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,120
Be happy on your birthday.

60
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Please.

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm fine.

62
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
No.

63
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm not here to say cheers

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
who's been working hard.

65
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,720
What I want to tell you is

66
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,040
you're great.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,560
You're great now.

68
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
You'll be a great adult in the future.

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,680
Don't cry.

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
Thank you, brother.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,400
You're a great adult

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,760
I'll be a great adult when I grow up.

73
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,000
I have to take good care of my sister.

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,360
Just one bottle?

75
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,600
What about yours?

76
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
How is it?

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,720
Thank you.

78
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,320
Help!

79
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Help!

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Someone fell into the sea!

81
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,040
Help!

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,600
Hurry!

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,240
Heen!

84
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
Heen!

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,080
Xuan.

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,680
Call someone.

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
Xuan.

88
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,040
Heen!

89
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,880
Heen!

90
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,720
Wake up!

91
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,360
Heen!

92
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Xuan, wake up!

93
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,960
Heen!

94
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Heen!

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,159
Heen!

96
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,280
Did Heen really drown?

97
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,640
Yes.

98
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,160
But...

99
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
No way!

100
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Heen can swim.

101
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,280
He's a good swimmer.

102
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,960
That day when he fell into the sea,

103
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,200
to the time I saved him ashore.

104
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
If he could really swim,

105
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
he wouldn't be out of breath so soon.

106
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,679
So something must have happened.

107
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,880
I didn't know.

108
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,600
Even if it was an accident,

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,159
I won't forgive them.

110
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,960
They bullied him when they were alive.

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
I won't let him rest in peace even if he dies.

112
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,680
It's okay.

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,480
It's okay.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,880
And me.

115
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,680
See?

116
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,800
That's how my life is.

117
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
You're someone in the light.

118
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
You shouldn't be with me.

119
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
My brother Jin Moyan and I

120
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,480
are not the same mother.

121
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,560
I’m the illegitimate son of the Jin family.

122
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Just like you,

123
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,280
I wasn't born to stand in the light.

124
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
When I saw Xie Xuan that day,

125
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,400
as if I saw myself.

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,680
I had such a glamorous birthday party.

127
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
But only I know

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
what kind of obstacles they face.

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,400
Humph.

130
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
I saw Heen die in my arms.

131
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
as if...

132
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,640
I saw myself die.

133
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,800
Wang Xinyan.

134
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,720
I want to investigate Xie Xuan with you.

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,360
not just to help you.

136
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
but more for myself.

137
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,080
Because of your brother,

138
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,360
because of your brother.

139
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,560
I just don't want anyone

140
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,960
leave like him.

141
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,640
Okay.

142
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,160
I won't come to you.

143
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
you won't come to me, right?

144
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,520
Isn't the Cyber City project mine?

145
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,680
Who are you to give it to others?

146
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,400
You're still that slut.

147
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,080
Xinni.

148
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,800
That's enough.

149
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm talking to you.

150
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,080
What are you doing?

151
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,080
Who told you to ignore me?

152
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm working.

153
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,200
Can't you see?

154
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
Is it because of work?

155
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,280
You ignored me

156
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,600
because you like her, right?

157
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Shaking.

158
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,120
What are you talking about?

159
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you know how important this jar of wine is to me?

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,760
It's just a jar of wine.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
I'll compensate you.

162
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,240
I've transferred the money to you.

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
It's enough to buy ten jars of yours.

164
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,680
Happy?

165
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,440
Shaking, I don't need your money.

166
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,200
You know what?

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Not everything can be solved with money.

168
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
You don't know how to respect others' work.

169
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,400
and self-righteous.

170
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,040
You're disgusting.

171
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
You are not welcome here.

172
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,360
Jin Yetlei, how dare you

173
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,960
to criticize me?

174
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,040
I've transferred the money to you.

175
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
Let alone a jar of wine,

176
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,480
all the wine here,

177
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,280
I'll smash them all if I want.

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Are you crazy?

179
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,040
You're talking to me now.

180
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
You're crazy.

181
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,120
Get out of my chateau!

182
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,320
Get out!

183
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Get lost.

184
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,080
Arrange Xinni to join Minglan as an intern

185
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,960
as an intern.

186
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,880
But...

187
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
let Xinni join the project team.

188
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,720
I think she should

189
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,320
she should have a good exercise.

190
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
How old is Director Wang?

191
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,720
He's pretty.

192
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,880
