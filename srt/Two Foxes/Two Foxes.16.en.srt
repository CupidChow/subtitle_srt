1
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,920
Du Lan is back.

2
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,960
She’s not easy to deal with.

3
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
How old is she?

4
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,160
He's seven years old. He's seven years old.

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,720
That means

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,960
Xie gave birth to you

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,840
he gave birth to you.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,720
Yes.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,200
It's my fault for not being good enough.

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,200
Since this child is Xie's,

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,680
he is still my son.

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,080
Yumei.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,880
I want to take him back to Xie’s home.

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
In this way,

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,200
a good growth and education environment.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
and be the successor of the group in the future.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
I can't let you take care of him for nothing.

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,520
Take the money.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,760
All these years,

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,960
for all these years.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,640
Mom.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
We don't want the money.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,920
Shut up!

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,800
Baby.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,520
Come here.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,920
Baby.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,759
Good boy.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Sister!

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Heen!

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,080
On the day Heen died,

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
Do you remember anything else?

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,880
Anything.

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,720
Nothing special.

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
The birthday party

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,520
It was a big party.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,000
and invited many guests.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Du Lan’s superficial skills

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,680
is always perfect.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,840
If outsiders see it,

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
Who doesn't praise her for being magnanimous?

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,320
Yes.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
She paid a lot.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,560
I remember that day,

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Even the guests' souvenirs

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,079
is Lado's cake.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,280
Lado

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,480
What's wrong?

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,240
Their cake

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
is mixed nuts.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
Heen is allergic to nuts.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,880
Heen knows it himself.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,079
Is he allergic to nuts?

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,440
Yes.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Hello.

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,440
I've asked the old employees.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
He still remembers the birthday party you mentioned.

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
At that time, he booked 100 shop signatures.

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,800
This is it.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
This is the classic design of the shop.

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,560
The client said

61
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,200
not everyone likes the taste of nuts.

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
So let's grind the nuts into fine powder

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
and cover the fragrance.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,079
Anyway, it's troublesome.

65
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,280
So everyone remembers it.

66
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,640
Do you have the purchase record?

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,920
Sorry.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
It's been too long.

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,960
Thank you.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,040
The truth is right in front of us.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
Is there nothing we can do?

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,360
There will be a way to prove it.

73
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,760
I will find a way

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,880
as soon as possible.

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't worry.

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,640
How could this happen?

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
All of a sudden?

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,640
It's okay.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,480
Work hard.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,240
Wang Simyeon.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,880
You're fired.

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Pack up.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Let's go.

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,680
You're quitting already?

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,760
But you don't have the right

86
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
ten times the compensation.

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Du Lan did it.

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
So soon?

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,520
She fired everyone

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,080
of the Saibo City Project.

91
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
Just fired?

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm afraid it won't be that simple.

93
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,680
Sorry, Miss Wang.

94
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,840
We found some information in your computer.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm afraid you can't leave the company yet.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,800
Miss Wang.

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
Please leave the phone to us during the investigation.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
It seems that the security department of Minglan Group

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,600
needs more legal training.

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,240
Miss Wang,

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,080
Please cooperate with us.

102
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
During the investigation,

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,360
To prevent information from leaking,

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
The phone is my personal property.

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
You have no right to confiscate it.

106
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Please turn off your phone.

107
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Is this okay?

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,640
Yes.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,560
Hello?

110
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm...

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Okay.

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Thank you.

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Wang Xinyan.

114
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,120
We need you to explain

115
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,960
Why is there

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,760
in your computer?

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,080
which is completely different from

118
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
that you submitted.

119
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,680
Who knows who copied it?

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Before I submitted my computer,

121
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
in front of

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,600
in front of the staff of HR.

123
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,520
Wang Simyeon.

124
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,480
You are under arrest for

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
and embezzlement of public funds.

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,040
Mr. Du is kind

127
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
to solve this problem inside.

128
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,680
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

129
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
If you keep this attitude,

130
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,440
we can sue you

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,280
with legal procedures.

132
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
How can I explain

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,040
How do I explain it?

134
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,160
How?

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,880
I explained everything in detail.

136
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
But you didn't explain

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
the whereabouts of these accounts.

138
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
You can't provide these accounts yourselves.

139
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,040
The list I signed.

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
Why are you so sure

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
that I'm embezzled?

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,080
Wang Simyeon.

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,480
Three hours.

144
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,360
Our patience is limited.

145
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
You'd better tell us the truth.

146
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
So you're going to confess by torture today?

147
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,880
It's useless no matter what I say.

148
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
Call the police.

149
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,159
Wang Xinyan.

150
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't be ungrateful.

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,960
Thank you for your hard work.

152
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,720
Mr. Du bought coffee for you.

153
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,280
I need to go to the bathroom.

154
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
Let's go together.

155
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,760
Hurry up.

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Right away.

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,320
Why are you here?

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,160
How can I not come?

159
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Mr. Yan, you’re finally here.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
Du Lan planned it from the beginning.

161
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,520
She asked us to tamper with the project

162
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,840
to remove the traces of Shaking in the project.

163
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,640
This is the evidence.

164
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,560
Thank you.

165
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,040
We didn't have enough time.

166
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,480
The evidence is not complete.

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,680
That's enough for today.

168
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Wang Simyeon

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll be right there.

170
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,920
Wang Simyeon.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,680
I wanted to give you a chance.

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,120
Unfortunately,

173
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
You don't cherish it.

174
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Lin Ke.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,720
The media is almost downstairs.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,640
Go pick her up.

177
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
Isn’t Mrs. Du kind?

178
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Why didn't you call the police

179
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
instead of calling the police?

180
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,560
He's trying to kill me.

181
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,280
A bug who stole the company's wealth.

182
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
Don't be too soft-hearted.

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,240
That makes sense.

184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,520
The media should be here soon.

185
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
Good.

186
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Let's see

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,720
who is the real person

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,920
who embezzled public funds.

189
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,520
Please excuse us.

190
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,000
Compared to your useless mother,

191
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
than your useless mother.

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,520
Aunt Du,

193
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,720
This trick of secret ferry and empty-city scheme

194
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
