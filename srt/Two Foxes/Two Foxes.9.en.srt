I'm here to send you the contract of the Cyber City Project.

2
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,880
What took you so long?

3
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
Mr. Zhang.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,039
Black and white.

5
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,640
The contract of Cyber City

6
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,360
can clear all your doubts.

7
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,840
Please have a look.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,680
Okay.

9
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,360
Not bad.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,960
Mr. Xie.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
I told you.

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,520
Trust yourself.

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,360
Right?

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Come on.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,560
Let's continue.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,600
Come on.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,520
Go on.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,240
Keep playing

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,600
Let's play.

20
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,680
Wang Xinyan.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,840
What are you doing?

22
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,800
Dad.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,520
I don't want to do anything.

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,800
Promise me.

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,040
you’ll behave yourself.

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
stay in Zhaosheng.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,560
I agreed to give you a chance.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
What are you doing now?

29
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
Can't you grow up?

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
Are you afraid that the mother and daughter

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
didn't notice you, right?

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,120
Wang Xinyan, let me tell you.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,720
If you make trouble for me,

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,480
I’ll let you leave Zhaosheng.

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
Zhaosheng is talking about

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
with Mr. Jin.

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,960
Mr. Jin suddenly made this decision.

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I dare not push.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
or answer it.

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,400
When I got the contract,

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,280
as soon as I got the contract.

42
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,680
Dad.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
I know this project

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,760
to work with Xinni.

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
But I think

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,880
you can consider me.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
After all, I'm your daughter.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
I got the Cyber City project

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
to you,

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,200
for you.

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,840
Wang Xinyan.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,320
Don't you know

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,520
what to think?

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you have to be like your mother

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
like your mother?

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm different from her.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,280
Let's go.

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,399
Wait.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,200
Let's pretend we never met today.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Okay.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,600
Dad.

62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,159
Related work.

63
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:32,520
Draw the relevant I.

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:32,880
Related factories.

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,080
I bought you the stuff.

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,159
The first queue

67
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,440
Get in.

68
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
This looks nice.

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
That dress looks nice.

70
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,440
Look.

71
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,560
Miss.

72
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
You're so pretty.

73
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
Can I take a street photo for you?

74
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,920
Sure.

75
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,520
Take a look.

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,080
Who are you?

77
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,960
It doesn't matter who I am.

78
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:04,920
Tell me.

79
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
if your father

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
what will happen

81
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
what will happen.

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
What do you want to do?

83
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
I just want you to get something for me.

84
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,440
Dad.

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,680
I sent you a message.

86
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,360
I believe you will be interested.

87
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
What are you doing?

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
I want the Cyber City Project.

89
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
No way.

90
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't even think about it.

91
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,320
I know it's hard for you,

92
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
so I'm not in a hurry to decide.

93
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
Before 9 a.m. tomorrow,

94
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
as long as you give me an answer,

95
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I promise.

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
all the videos

97
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
will be deleted.

98
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,400
Do you think

99
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,480
you can threaten me

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
to threaten me.

101
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,680
Really?

102
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,480
Of course I can’t.

103
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
But Mrs. Du Lan

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
may help me.

105
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,120
Dad.

106
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,159
[Remember to meet me before 9 a.m. tomorrow.]

107
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,720
Dad.

108
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Don't forget to look down on me before 9 a.m. tomorrow.

109
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I underestimated you, Xie Haiming.

110
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
He switched the video from afar.

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
The ship has to be repaired.

112
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't you want a new one?

Director Wang.

114
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,960
You're a person who doesn't come to Sanbao Hall for no reason.

115
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,840
Let me guess.

116
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,040
The Cyber City project was stolen.

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,080
Mr. Jin is as smart as always.

118
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,760
I’ll get straight to the point.

119
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
Don't you want to cooperate?

120
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,840
Can you hold on to this plan for me?

121
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
