1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,440
Hang in there.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,560
You're good at fighting.

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,920
I know it's you.

4
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,680
How can I fight back?

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,280
What about your mouth?

6
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,880
I did.

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
The point is

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,760
Stop laughing.

9
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
Jin Xyan.

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,280
Did anyone say you have a cute idea?

11
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,440
You're laughing at me.

12
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,120
I want to be with you.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,160
That day in the cabin,

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
What I regret the most

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
I haven't avenged Heen yet.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,960
I haven't had the chance

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,440
to tell you that I want to be with you.

18
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
Make sure you get home safely.

19
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay.

20
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,480
The laptop Heen gave me is missing.

21
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
It has all the evidence.

22
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
Call the police.

23
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,920
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

24
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,560
What happened?

25
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Du Lan asked someone to throw your things out of Minglan.

26
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
You can't go in.

27
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,600
Director Wang.

28
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
It's inappropriate.

29
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,560
Wang Simyeon.

30
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
Thanks to your mother,

31
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
I only spent 100,000 yuan.

32
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,040
All the worries are solved.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,480
Kid.

34
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Fight me?

35
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
You're still a little younger.

36
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
You're lucky to be alive.

37
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,520
Next time,

38
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,040
I won't let you off so easily.

39
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
It's a gift from the little girl.

40
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Here we are.

41
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,000
Yumei is back.

42
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,560
You’re back.

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
This outfit looks nice.

44
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,360
Of course.

45
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,680
I just bought it.

46
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,360
It's a gift from the little girl.

47
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Here we are.

48
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,360
Where's Heen's computer?

49
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
You scared me.

50
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

51
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Where's Heen's computer?

52
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,400
That stupid computer.

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,000
They only accept parts.

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,200
It's done.

55
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,640
and gave me hundreds of yuan.

56
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,159
Why?

57
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,640
Except for not fulfilling your duty as a mother,

58
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,200
Forget it.

59
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Why are you doing this to me?

60
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Wang Yumei.

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
Is there anything else in your eyes besides money?

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,720
What else do I need?

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
What?

64
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,680
It's better than holding the money in your own hands.

65
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,720
Hello?

66
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,840
110.

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,000
My house was robbed.

68
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
I want to call the police.

69
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Please come here.

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,480
1201, unit 3 of Mingcheng Community.

71
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,880
Yes.

72
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,680
The fingerprints are still there.

73
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,040
Jin.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
I just found out.

75
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
Before she was in a relationship with Xu Yan,

76
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
before she fell in love with Xinyan.

77
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,159
I knew she was ambitious.

78
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,480
But I didn't expect

79
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
she was so ambitious.

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Fortunately, Xu Yan is a good girl.

81
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,960
He has no ambition for the Jin family.

82
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Otherwise, if they are together,

83
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,360
if they get the Jin family involved,

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,080
I’ll be too ashamed to see you.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm back, boss.

86
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,080
What is it?

87
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,920
Why are you in such a hurry?

88
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Take a look.

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,159
I won't beat around the bush.

90
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,080
Xie Simyeon is too troublesome.

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
You broke up with her.

92
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,680
Brother.

93
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,159
What if I say no?

94
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
If I remember correctly,

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
this is the second time.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
For this woman,

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
for this woman.

98
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,000
So,

99
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
you are ambitious

100
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
to Jin family, right?

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
These are two different things.

102
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
Xie Xinyan planned everything

103
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,120
step by step.

104
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
to get the Xie family's property.

105
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
If you are with her,

106
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,280
How dare you say that

107
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,440
How dare you say that?

108
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
You don't have any ideas or ambition?

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,040
What?

110
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
You want to get involved?

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
Say something.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
It's none of your business.

113
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,640
Mind your own business.

114
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,919
I wasn't going down,

115
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,559
But if you say so,

116
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I have to go and have a look.

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,480
Lei, you...

118
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,520
Brother,

119
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
I just hope that

120
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
I can make my own decision.

121
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,040
It has nothing to do with anything else.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
Don't tell me

123
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
trust me?

124
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
There's no room for discussion.

125
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,480
If you choose that woman,

126
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
don’t marry into the Jin family.

127
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
All these years,

128
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,360
If it weren't for my mercy,

129
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,080
would you have lived a carefree life?

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,880
Uncle...

131
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
Think about it.

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,760
Am I talking about women?

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
If you're with someone else,

134
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,120
I won't interfere.

135
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,920
But Xie Simyeon

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,360
is too thoughtful.

137
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,720
It's not like that.

138
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Shut up.

139
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,880
You're still defending them?

140
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,160
Aren't you afraid that...

141
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
Aren't you afraid that one day

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
they will join forces

143
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
to steal your stuff.

144
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,040
I didn't expect you to think of me like this.

145
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
All this time,

146
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
for taking care of me.

147
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
What I want

148
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
is just a home.

149
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,080
So since I was young,

150
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,480
I've never fought for anything.

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,520
step by step.

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,280
I didn't expect

153
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,320
you still miss me so much.

154
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
In that case,

155
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
there's no need for me to stay.

156
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,400
From now on,

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,320
I’m no longer a member of the Jin family.

158
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,880
Uncle.

159
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
Wang Simyeon.

160
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,080
I've been waiting for you all night.

161
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
Where have you been?

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
How dare you call the police to arrest your mother?

163
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,640
If I didn't bring my household register,

164
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,280
I wouldn't be able to get out today.

165
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,480
You know what?

166
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
If possible,

167
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
I'd rather not have a mother like you.

168
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Do you think I want a daughter like you?

169
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll kill you today.

170
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,360
I...

171
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,680
You little...

172
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,760
I knew it.

173
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,280
someone is born

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,480
deserve to be a mother.

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
What did you say?

176
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
I don't deserve to be a mother.

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,080
I don't deserve to be a mom.

178
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,360
I don't deserve to be a mother.

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,360
You can grow up without me.

180
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,280
Can you live in this world without me?

181
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't deserve to be a mother.

182
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
I don't deserve to be a mother.

183
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,000
Can you grow up like that?

184
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,120
Let me tell you.

185
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,840
I even gave you your life.

186
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
I don't deserve to be a mother.

187
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,680
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other.

188
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,280
Stop calling me mom.

189
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,560
I don't have an ungrateful daughter like you.

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,720
I'll kill you!

191
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,080
