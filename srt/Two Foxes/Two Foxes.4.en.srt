1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,000
There's a wine tasting party at nine tonight.

2
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,480
I think you can go.

3
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm not going today.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,920
I have something to do.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Just take me to the dressing shop ahead.

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,080
You like this dress.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,880
I told you to wear enough.

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,080
Remember this feeling.

9
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,840
This is the price for collapsing with me.

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,039
What was your name again?

11
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,320
Wang Yanxin, right?

12
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
I heard you work in Zhaosheng.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,680
Do you know?

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
Zhaosheng belongs to the Xie family.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
I’ll crush you to death.

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
It's like crushing an ant

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
like killing an ant.

18
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,000
I knew it.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,479
Ms. Xie who is so arrogant

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
doesn’t remember us.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,440
What?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is this all Miss Xie dares to do?

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Nice craftsmanship.

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,919
Thank you.

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,600
Do you think I dare not take it seriously?

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,280
Miss Xie, calm down.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
There are surveillance cameras.

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,920
Next time, it won't be wine

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
will not be wine.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
Such good wine.

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
Thank you.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Why are you laughing?

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Why are you laughing?

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,400
Answer me.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,920
Smile.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
Smile!

37
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,880
Smile.

38
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,560
You have to

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,520
Shake it.

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,680
And...

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,480
Handsome.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,800
A wine tasting party.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Free tasting.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
And then

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,079
See if it's hanging on the wall.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Smell it.

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
Look at this fragrance.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
Someone was hit over there.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
It seems to be a woman.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,240
Someone got hit.

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,360
Let's go.

52
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,280
Smile!

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Smile.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Smile.

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,760
Uncle.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,440
She...

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
Why are you here?

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,480
This woman...

59
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
She bullied me.

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,200
Last time at the cocktail party, she deliberately bumped into me.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,280
This time,

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,120
She...

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
She's picking on me again.

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Uncle.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
She really bullied me.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
If I didn't have these friends,

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm done for.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Uncle.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
Look.

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm hurt.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,320
Uncle.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
I have eyes

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
Save your explanation for Lei.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Uncle

75
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,560
That woman can't beat that woman.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,520
This is so miserable.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Xinni.

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
What should we do now?

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,680
Shut up!

80
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,880
Yi Xiao Le.

81
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Yi Xiao Le.

82
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
What's wrong?

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Scissors.

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Stab me.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Xinni.

86
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Xinni.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,159
Xinni.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,000
What's wrong?

89
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,560
It hurts.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,560
What happened?

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,680
Ouch!

92
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,160
She bullied me.

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
It hurts.

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,200
Today...

95
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,640
I went to the shop across the street today.

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
I saw

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,800
the woman

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
last time.

99
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
In the end,

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,320
not only didn't apologize,

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,040
she hit me.

102
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Now everyone

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
can bully Nini now.

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,400
I've never been hurt like this.

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Is he worth your effort?

106
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

107
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
About tonight...

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,640
I wish it was just a beautiful coincidence.

109
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,080
Although the plan is completed tonight,

110
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
but we have Jin Xyan.

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,080
You have your grievances.

112
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,880
But you can't beat her up like that.

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,280
She's fine.

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,040
Now I'm injured

115
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,680
Lei Lei, how can you speak for others?

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,200
Do you have any feelings

117
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
about that woman?

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,160
Xinni.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm not trying to reason with you.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
or I have feelings for other women.

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
I just don't think this is how it should be handled.

122
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
All right.

123
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,640
Lei,

124
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm fine.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,680
You don't have to come.

126
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,480
It's just a scratch.

127
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,679
Luckily,

128
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,679
Mr. Jin took me to the repair shop.

129
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
See you later.

130
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,640
Uncle.

131
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,360
How is Simyeon?

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
Not good.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,600
Leave her alone.

134
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
I'll send her back safely.

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Your target is not Lei.

136
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
It's Shaking, right?

137
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I guess I was right.

138
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,200
How did you know?

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Quite detailed.

140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,680
You asked Lei to go to KOVSKY tonight

141
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
and chose a nearby repair shop.

142
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,440
Obviously,

143
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,200
you look down tonight

144
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,280
to show him

145
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,800
But if your target is Lei,

146
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
if someone bullies you,

147
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
at least

148
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
when I see her.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
What do you

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
seduce someone tonight,

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
you'll scare me away.

152
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
So I guess

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
your real target is not Lei.

154
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
It's Shaking.

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,840
Of course.

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,360
What makes me sure

157
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
is your reaction.

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
You're really smart and scary.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Mr. Fox.

160
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
You too.

161
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
You're really a fox.

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,000
What you did tonight

163
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,760
to let

164
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
to see

165
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
Xie Xinni, right?

166
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,760
Yes.

167
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,880
Since you know,

168
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
can you let me go from now on?

169
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
Mr Fox.

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
I’ll take your silence as a yes.

171
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,160
If you want to use the Jin family

172
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
to deal with the Xie family,

173
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
Why didn't you choose me?

174
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:08,840
