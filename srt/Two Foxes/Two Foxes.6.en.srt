1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,440
Jin Yetlei.

2
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,280
How dare you speak for others?

3
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm your fiancée.

4
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,920
Xinni.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,400
There's an occasion to be jealous.

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,840
I...

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,080
What look?

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,040
What's that look?

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,480
Xinyan Wang.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,960
Xinni.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
What do you mean?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Xinni.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,120
Who are you putting up with now?

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
Did I bully you?

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,080
Xinni.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,360
Did you see Jin Yetlei?

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,800
Are you all together?

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,560
Security.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,680
Kick them out.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,200
I have something to do.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Go back first.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,039
Jin Yetlei.

24
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,800
Please leave.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,480
Mr. Lin.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,720
Can you give me another chance?

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,520
Let's sit down.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,360
Mr. Lin.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,080
It's a misunderstanding today.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Action painting.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,200
Originally, it's about irregular paintings.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,600
No fixed position.

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Repeat unconscious behaviors

34
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,400
to create complicated and hard to distinguish.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
The wrong lines

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,200
[Each painting is different.]

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,960
On the contrary,

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,440
if an art

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,880
can be framed as right and wrong,

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Ugly.

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,640
If it's bad,

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,600
it doesn't deserve to be called art.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,320
What is the art

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,240
in your heart?

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,000
There's no limit.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
I've tasted Mr. Lin's wine.

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,320
and here.

48
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,240
Your painting

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,960
has something in common.

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
Every product

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
is unique.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
Have a seat.

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,240
Captain,

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,200
You asked me to check Mr. Lin of Kikk Gallery.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,280
is a decent businessman.

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
The Lina Hotel under his name

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
is quite famous in the industry.

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
I didn't find anything wrong.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay.

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,040
Sim-yeon.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
As planned,

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
I'll leave the gallery to you.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,600
I hope you can finish

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
as soon as possible.

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
The wine factory.

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,680
We're really waiting for an emergency.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Don't worry.

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,280
Xu Yan.

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,680
Mr. Zhao.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Wait for me.

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,360
Mr. Zhao, what brings you here today?

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,640
Have you

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,880
Is it fixed?

74
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,560
Yes.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,000
Thanks to Mr. Zhao's sponsorship last time.

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Xu Yan.

77
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
It's not that I don't trust you.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,960
But the company has rules.

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
If you have time,

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,600
when you have time.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,120
No problem.

82
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,760
Mr. Zhao.

83
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
Is someone

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
say to you?

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,840
It's just a routine.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,640
Got it.

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm leaving.

88
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,520
Mr Zhao.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,200
See you.

90
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,040
Boss.

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
It's exhausting just to organize the bill.

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,680
Who is so wicked?

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,040
He wrote a report letter to all the sponsors.

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,280
What a joke.

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Shameless!

96
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,840
Looks like the forest is big.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,640
There are always foxes who can't bear to see others idle.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,400
0:07:08

99
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,560
20.

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,200
0:00:22:3

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,120
0:00:24:06

102
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,720
0:00:28:08

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,880
0:29:46.

104
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,440
Are you done?

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,240
Yes.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,400
Let’s go.

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,800
Mr. Jin.

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,040
You followed me?

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,040
Thank you, Director Wang.

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,480
You worked so hard to find me a job.

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
Aren't you more curious

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
what you're up to.

113
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,000
I told you to mind your own business.

114
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,840
why are you still chasing me?

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
You joined hands with Mr. Lin of the gallery

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,120
to get Lei involved

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
to get Xiao Lei involved.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,600
What cooperation did you talk about with Mr. Lin?

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
You're willing to

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
to pay for the gallery.

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,840
If you want to know,

122
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,400
why don't you investigate it yourself?

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,880
It's hard to do it by yourself.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Will you tell me

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
or should I call the police?

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
Mr. Lin's restaurant has poor turnover.

127
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920
I promised to help him change the situation.

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh.

129
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
So Lei

130
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,360
is

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
He'll pay for it.

132
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,600
and turn the situation around.

133
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,799
Really?

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
Why is he a pushover?

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,240
It's mutual benefit.

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Mr. Lin has skills,

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,680
but he doesn't have money for turnover.

138
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
Lei has money,

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
but he didn't make wine.

140
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,440
I just helped them achieve their cooperation.

141
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
But

142
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
and a small part

143
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,160
in the middle.

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,440
Oh.

145
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
A small part.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't hurt Lei.

147
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,280
I will only

148
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,840
I'll only explain this once.

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
I'm here to help Director Wang.

150
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,800
Compared to you,

151
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,160
Xie Xinni

152
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,040
because of a trivial matter.

153
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
is a time bomb.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,120
No need.

155
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
Mr. Jin helped me the most

156
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
is to pretend not to see me tonight.

157
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
Otherwise, I can't guarantee

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,880
what I’ll do next time

159
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
to make Mr. Jin unscathed.

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
Or

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,880
Mr. Jin has a crush on me?

162
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,240
That’s why he’s obsessed with me.

163
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
If you want to play the game of adults,

164
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
don't be so reserved.

165
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
If you don't know how,

166
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
I can teach you by hand.

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,000
teach you.

168
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,040
I play Wang Sim-yeon.

169
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,040
Actor.

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,960

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,960

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,960
Han Shuo plays Fang Tonbin.

185
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,280
I play Xiao Xiaole.
