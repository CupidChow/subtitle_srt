1
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,440
Mr. Jin is as smart as always.

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
I’ll get straight to the point.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,040
Don't you want to cooperate?

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,200
Can you hold on to this plan for me?

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,240
I see.

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,840
No.

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Director Wang.

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,720
It's fine, Xia Yingchun.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,960
Zhong Wu Yan is busy.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,120
You rejected me

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,320
but you turned me down.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,320
Why should I agree this time?

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,680
I came today

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,039
prepared to be rejected by you.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm sure you'll agree.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Who gave you the confidence?

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,560
I bet

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,520
you won't let him die.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,520
Director Wang.

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
Wang Xinyan.

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
This is crazy.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,280
Wang Simyeon.

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,000
Wang Simyeon.

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
Thank you.

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,880
You must be a great adult.

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,200
When I grow up,

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
a great adult.

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
Pick me as your teammate.

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
to be my teammate.

30
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,000
But if you want to be my stumbling block,

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't mind wasting my energy

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,080
to move you away.

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Mr. Jin.

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,400
People who stand in the light

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
should stay in the light.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Don't mess with others.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Don't try to get close to the darkness.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,160
It will be swallowed by darkness.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Are you crazy?

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Mr. Jin.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,920
I won.

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,800
Mr. Zhang.

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,920
According to the procedures,

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,520
we have to pay Minglan this afternoon.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,080
But I heard that...

46
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
the Cyborg City plan was put off again.

47
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,200
What?

48
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,360
Is your news reliable?

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,760
What's going on?

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,560
I think I had a rear-end collision.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,920
Let me get off and have a look.

52
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,960
What's going on?

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
How did you drive?

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,760
Oh.

55
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,600
Sorry.

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm really sorry.

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Can you drive?

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,600
How could you bump into it?

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Take a photo and go to the insurance.

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,640
I'll pay for it.

61
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,440
Fine.

62
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm really sorry.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,160
Sorry.

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,520
What's going on?

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,960
Xu Yan.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,120
Mr. Zhang.

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,880
Why are you here?

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
Yes.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
What a coincidence.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,200
I scratched your car by accident.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm really sorry.

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,760
It's okay.

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,800
Is it serious?

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,880
The bumper is crooked.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
It's nothing.

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
It's okay.

77
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,640
By the way, Xu Yan,

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,640
I...

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
I've been thinking about

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
to visit your brother.

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
I heard that the Jin’s joint with Minglan

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
with Minglan.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,760
I want to go and congratulate him.

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,760
Did it start?

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
I didn't hear about it.

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
No.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,800
It didn't start?

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
I don't think so.

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,720
Well,

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't care much about the group.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,280
This project may be low-key.

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,600
I don't know if it's activated.

93
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,960
It’s normal.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Mr. Zhang,

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,360
You too.

96
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,880
Well,

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,159
Let your driver

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,840
Take a photo.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
What photos?

100
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,560
Seriously.

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
It's not enough

102
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
is not enough for our meal.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,160
Right?

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,080
It's okay.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,920
We're all busy.

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,400
Let's go.

107
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,560
It's okay.

109
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
Okay.

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,320
I heard that you've got a promotion, right?

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,320
Let's find a chance to invite your brother

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,480
Let's play together.

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,680
Take care.

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,520
Bye.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,560
Xie Haiming.

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,960
How dare you set me up?

117
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,200
Stop the loans for now.

118
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,400
Mr. Zhang.

120
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
I'll call Xie Haiming.

121
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,680
On Monday morning,

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,320
go to Minglan to report to Fang Dongbin, the director of the business department.

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,720
You don't want me to get involved.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,880
Aren't you afraid that I'll trouble you?

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,200
Don't pretend to be good again.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,760
Take it when you're good, okay?

127
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Let's go.

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,920
Don't worry.

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll be careful.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,120
not to let anyone find out about our relationship.

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
Mr. Jin just said

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,760
with Mr. Zhang.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Mr. Zhang forced Xie Haiming

134
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,960
to start the Cyber City plan.

135
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,640
How did you know Mr. Zhang would take the bait?

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,240
A stone

137
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,600
will only emerge on the calm water.

138
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
And when two ripples bump into each other,

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
will cause a wave.

140
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
My words mean nothing.

141
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,919
But with Mr. Zhang’s suspicion,

142
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,799
things will definitely go the same way.

143
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,880
Mr. Jin is really good at observing people’s hearts.

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,919
It’s a great move.

145
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,000
Got it.

146
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Good.

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
It's worth

148
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
to jump into the sea.

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
Wang Simyeon.

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,960
Do you really not care about your life?

151
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
It's not that I don't care about my life,

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,920
but I trust you more.

153
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
I won't let you die.

154
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,160
Try it.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,040
I promise you'll be satisfied.

156
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,040
How is it?

157
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
Pretty good.

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,320
Not bad, right?

159
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,200
That's it.

160
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,040
This bottle

161
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I want six.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,920
Wine bottles and packaging.

163
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
should look better.

164
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm giving it to someone.

165
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
You're working with Mr. Lin so happily.

166
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

167
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,560
But

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
today is to celebrate

169
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,480
the Cyber City Project

170
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
can go smoothly.

171
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,680
My dad

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,000
He said to put it off,

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,840
and then get over it.

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,040
Weird.

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
That's how he is.

176
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,200
Uncle.

177
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Do you think

178
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Shin-yeon will like it when she receives this gift?

179
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,080
This time,

180
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,040
thanks to Xin Yan's introduction.

181
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,760
to introduce me.

182
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
Mr. Lin

183
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
is good at brewing wine.

184
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
and a nice person.

185
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,640
But most importantly,

186
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Mr. Lin, a senior in the industry,

187
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,960
to teach me experience and skills.

188
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Sim-yeon is amazing.

189
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Why didn't I know her earlier?

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,720
If I knew her earlier,

191
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
My chateau would have been built long ago.

192
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,040
No matter what you are busy with,

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,760
Let's meet in Jinzhou.

194
