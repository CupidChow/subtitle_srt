1
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Contract.

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't get wet.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,280
It's just a contract.

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,840
Do you think

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,400
anything else?

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,560
I don't think so.

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,720
Or

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,720
do you want me

10
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,600
I think there is something.

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Mr. Jin,

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
If you play too much games,

13
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,479
it won't be fun.

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
But you set the trap first.

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,960
Are you

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
scared?

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
Yes.

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
I’m afraid Mr. Jin will love you.

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,360
to repay you.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
My partner

21
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,280
passed the test, right?

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
Why are you helping me?

23
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Heen!

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Wake up!

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,720
Heen.

26
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
You don't have long legs.

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,920
What if I can't pay you back one day?

28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,120
what should I do?

29
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,600
WXYZ.

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,520
This is the first year I sponsored you.

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Don't think too much.

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,280
The future is still long.

33
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
Everything will be fine.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Will it be okay?

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I can't even make it through tonight.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
It will.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
Why don't I let you hear the waves?

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Hypnotism works.

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
I just want to see

40
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
whether my decision

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
was right?

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Mr. Jin.

43
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,159
People who stand in the light

44
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,520
should stay in the light.

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
Don't mess with others.

46
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,400
Don't try to get close to the darkness.

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
You'll be swallowed by darkness.

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,120
All right.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm here to thank you.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
The darker it is,

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,840
the more light you can see.

53
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,960
When the sun rises,

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,440
You have to return it at sunset

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,280
I don't want to return it

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Then go.

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,640
live in Soma LoyIsland.

58
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,720
Time zone.

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
It's been 69 days.

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,240
for 69 days.

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,200
Uncle.

62
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,280
I've met someone who's just like you.

63
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,840
who loves to hold an umbrella.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
and meddlesome.

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,600
Uncle.

66
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Come back.

67
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,440
I've decided.

68
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,120
to break off the engagement.

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
I used to think

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,640
business marriage

71
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
It's the same with everyone.

72
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
But now I realize

73
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,840
it's really different

74
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,440
is really different.

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
I have someone I like.

76
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,880
Do I know him?

77
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,080
What kind of attitude is that?

78
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,280
You don't support me.

79
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
In this situation,

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
is not enough to support you

81
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
to break off the engagement.

82
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Yes.

83
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,000
We just had a fight.

84
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,800
So it's about

85
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,680
whether I support you or not?

86
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,840
Thank you.

87
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,640
Your gift.

88
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
is ready.

89
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Mr. Xie.

90
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,120
We have an important meeting this afternoon.

91
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,360
Talk to

92
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,640
with Mr. Zhang.

93
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
We need to control it.

94
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,080
Mr. Xie is here.

95
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,920
This way, please.

96
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,880
Boss.

97
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Mr. Xie just came.

98
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,760
Ouch.

99
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Nice shot

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,480
Nice shot!

101
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
Mr. Zhang.

102
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,880
Mr. Xie.

103
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Mr. Zhang.

104
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
According to CFO,

105
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
the contract has been signed

106
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,760
after the contract is signed.

107
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,240
Right?

108
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,640
Mr. Xie.

109
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
I heard from my general manager

110
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
it seems that

111
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
We haven't signed the Cyber City plan yet.

112
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,120
Is there anything wrong?

113
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,680
Of course not.

114
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,240
The Cyber City project

115
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
is a betrothal gift

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
from Mr. Jin.

117
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Don't worry.

118
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,200
Ah.

119
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,560
Mr. Zhang.

120
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
I want to know

121
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
why this one

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Why?

123
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,400
haven’t called yet?

124
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,240
Mr. Xie.

125
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,000
It’s a deal.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
to start the Cyber City plan.

127
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Mr. Zhang

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
agreed to pay.

129
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,120
But nothing happened.

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,440
How dare we make money?

131
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Mr. Zhang,

132
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,080
Don’t play the eagle when you see the rabbit.

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,520
Mr. Xie.

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Since you’re here,

135
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,200
Let's play a game.

136
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,320
Nice shot!

137
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,840
Mr. Xie.

138
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,960
Mr. Zhang.

139
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,520
Please.

140
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
Pick up the ball.

141
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,680
Lower.

142
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,960
Lower.

143
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,560
Okay.

144
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't move.

145
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,480
Don’t move.

146
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,880
Mr. Xie.

147
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,000
Watch me.

148
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Mr. Xie.

149
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,360
I’ll go farther than you.

150
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,840
What do you mean?

151
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,080
Mr. Xie.

152
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Come on.

153
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
You should feel it too.

154
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,280
Some people

155
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
said something they shouldn't.

156
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,520
I did something I shouldn't have.

157
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I have to educate him.

158
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,120
Am I right?

159
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,680
Pick up the ball.

160
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,720
Lower.

161
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Mr. Xie.

162
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,000
Mr. Zhang.

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,720
Are you threatening me?

164
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
I dare not.

165
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,120
Mr. Xie.

166
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,960
Let’s play.

167
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,240
Didn't I do a good job just now?

168
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,160
Trust yourself.

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,800
You can do it.

170
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,440
Excuse me.

171
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,920
Mr. Xie.

172
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,600
