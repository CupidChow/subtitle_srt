1
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,880
Are you okay?

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
I really underestimated Shaking.

3
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,840
A rat knows how to dig a hole.

4
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,800
Bad people are cruel.

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll ask for help tomorrow

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
to collect evidence of Shaking's tricks tomorrow.

7
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,440
But we can't go on like this.

8
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Isn't it about time

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
to return the money with interest?

10
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm getting impatient too.

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,520
Do you want to watch it this weekend?

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
French photographer's exhibition

13
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
How lucky

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,040
Hello, Lei.

15
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,079
I'm fine.

16
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,240
What about you?

17
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,720
Are you busy today?

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,760
I get off work at six.

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Come pick me up.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Simyeon.

21
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,720
Lei.

22
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Wait.

23
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,080
What's wrong?

24
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,160
I have something

25
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,120
to tell you first.

26
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
What is this?

27
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,440
Let's talk in the car.

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,440
What are they going to say?

29
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,320
That bitch.

30
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,600
Are you going to tell on me?

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Actually, I approached you

32
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
from the beginning.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,760
to get the Cyber City Project.

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,920
So,

35
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,280
I've met many women who pursued me these years.

36
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
Wang Xinyan.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,280
I thought you were different from them.

38
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,159
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,920
Since you tried so hard to get close to me,

40
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,800
why did you let me know?

41
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,480
Aren't you afraid that I'll withdraw the Cyber City Project?

42
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,440
Lei,

43
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm grateful for everything you've done to me.

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
But I can't lie to you anymore.

45
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,400
Since you can't accept my pursuit of you,

46
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
why did you do something

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
something that makes me interested in you?

48
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
I never thought this would happen.

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,320
Why?

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,120
Is this a new trick?

51
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,200
You're afraid I'll find out sooner or later.

52
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
You want me to forgive you

53
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
You want me to forgive you?

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,159
Wang Simyeon.

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Are you that good at toying with people's hearts?

56
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,640
Say something.

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,040
Lei,

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm sorry

59
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
You're good.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
So I can't lie to you anymore.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Even if you decide

63
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,840
to let me quit the Cyborg project,

64
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
I won't complain.

65
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Lei is so angry.

66
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,680
Did he know what I did to that bitch?

67
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,720
I don't care what you think.

68
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
you must find Mr Wu.

69
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
What are you doing every day?

70
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
You have no results at all.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,480
Think of a way.

72
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,800
Brother.

73
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,560
Look.

74
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,159
There's no need

75
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,280
to hold this charity dinner.

76
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,280
Look down.

77
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mr Wu from Donglin Technology is coming.

78
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you sure?

79
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,200
Yes.

80
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,840
Mr Wu.

81
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,640
His mother was hospitalized a few days ago.

82
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,760
So,

83
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
a charity dinner.

84
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,880
about the charity dinner.

85
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,880
Maybe

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
do more

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
good deeds.

88
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,840
You

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
You did well this time.

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Do it well.

91
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,520
No problem.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Brother.

93
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,080
I'm leaving.

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,039
Lei,

95
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,480
In a few days,

96
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
Jin’s will hold a charity dinner.

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
He wants you to attend it instead of him.

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Okay.

99
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,640
What do you think?

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
Is Director Wang

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
with this stage?

102
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
Very satisfied.

103
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
Mr. Jin wants to see Mr. Wu of Donglin Technology.

104
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
So you set up this trap.

105
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,960
Kill two birds with one stone.

106
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,400
You also killed two birds with one stone.

107
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Xie Xinni thought you had something on her.

108
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Throw the rat away.

109
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,440
Whether she takes the initiative

110
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
or wait passively,

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,520
Lei can't see her these days.

112
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
She wants to test Lei's reaction.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
She can only attend the charity dinner.

114
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
and get into your trap.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
I thought I did the best.

117
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,680
I've never seen him like this.

118
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Lei

119
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,720
very serious this time.

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,320
I know he's serious.

121
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,480
Without these,

122
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,560
I would consider his feelings for me.

123
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
But his world is beautiful

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,240
My world is full of storms.

125
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,760
We're not the same.

126
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
I've decided.

127
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
No regrets.

128
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
I've decided.

129
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,080
No regrets.

130
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,520
Wang Simyeon.

131
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
Am I your friend?

132
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Mr. Xie.

133
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,560
Aren’t you good at it?

134
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
You just gave me these garbage?

135
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
Is this the only business you can talk about?

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,440
These are the best brands in the world.

137
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,200
Mr. Xie.

138
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,040
Nothing you like?

139
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,280
Is there any global

140
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
limited edition?

141
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,120
Just one piece.

142
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,000
This one.

143
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
It's the only one in the country.

144
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,280
That's it.

145
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,800
Okay.

146
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,400
Xinni.

147
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,680
Actually,

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
in blue.

149
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,080
Cut the crap.

150
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,760
I don't want to collide with others.

151
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Understand?

152
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I can help you

153
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,080
I can help.

154
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Are you used to sleeping with the moonlight?

155
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,560
What do you mean?

156
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,920
Do you like sunbathing?

157
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,360
I like it. Just say it.

158
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
Forget about the dress.

159
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,920
I can still repay the curtains.

160
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,800
This time,

161
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,680
I want to give Shaking

162
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,120
