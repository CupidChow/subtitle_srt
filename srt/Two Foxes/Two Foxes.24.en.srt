1
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,240
Jang Chun-pil!

2
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,240
Zhang Chunji.

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Mr. Du.

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
Mr. Du.

5
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,240
Mr. Du.

6
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,600
Mr. Du.

7
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,320
He has fainted.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
I've fulfilled my promise.

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
Where is my money?

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,280
Where is the money you gave me?

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,200
Mr. Du.

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,759
Where is the money you gave me?

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
What's the rush?

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,560
But it's a deal.

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,360
I'll settle it all at once.

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't come to me again.

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,759
I'm a man of my word.

18
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,440
Where's my money?

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,200
Where's the money?

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,360
Count it.

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Are you satisfied?

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Yes.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
Is it enough?

24
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,520
You have to count it clearly.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,960
Okay.

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
Count it.

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Count it.

28
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
I'll make you greedy.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,040
I just fed a cake back then.

30
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,280
You kept threatening me.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
I shouldn't have kept you.

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
I shouldn't have kept you.

33
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,280
Sim-yeon.

34
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,240
Shin-yeon.

35
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Seo-yeon.

36
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,159
Seo Yan.

37
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,440
Where's Jang Chun-pil?

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Not me.

39
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I trust you.

40
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,120
But in this situation,

41
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,040
no matter how much I explain it.

42
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm glad you're okay.

43
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,120
Leave this to me.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Don't worry.

45
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,040
Don't worry.

46
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,200
Xu Yan.

47
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,760
I have a recording.

48
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Sim-yeon.

49
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,800
Where's my child?

50
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,520
Useless!

51
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,600
Take care of yourself.

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,960
Calm down.

53
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,680
Trash!

54
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,880
Give my baby back!

55
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,360
We'll have a baby.

56
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
There will be.

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Your child and my child

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,480
are not the same kind of person.

59
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,320
Don't worry, Miss.

60
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,000
You're a patient.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
You can't be so anxious.

62
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
I want you to get lost.

63
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Lei,

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
I want to change the ward.

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
It's all over.

66
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,120
Shaking.

67
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
You have no money.

68
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,040
Before you smash these things in the hospital,

69
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
before you smash them.

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
if you have the ability to pay.

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
I just lost my child.

72
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,880
That's also your child.

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Lei,

74
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,400
How could you

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,800
be so cruel?

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,400
I don't love you.

77
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,840
or your child.

78
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,480
He didn't come to this world.

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,480
I think

80
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,560
is the best arrangement.

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
I've signed the contract.

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
If you still refuse to sign it,

83
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,320
we'll have to proceed with the procedure.

84
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
Who are you to divorce me?

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,880
How could you divorce me?

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,880
I want to see my mom.

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm looking for Xie Hae-myung.

88
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,560
Your father's body was just cremated.

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,440
Note. However, [He was suspected of intentional murder]

90
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,440
and wide social influence.

91
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
Second, Du Lan has been arrested Homework.

92
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
Your mother was arrested for murder.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
If you sign the agreement,

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,880
you can get a sum of money to live.

95
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
If you go through the procedure,

96
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
I won't pay you a penny.

97
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,840
Get lost!

98
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
Get lost!

99
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,240
Get lost!

100
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
You want to divorce me?

101
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,480
No way.

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,840
Get lost!

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
I said divorce

104
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
to divorce?

105
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm the eldest daughter of the Xie family.

106
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
I...

107
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm the eldest daughter of the Xie family.

108
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,680
Boss.

109
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
It's my first day at work.

110
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,680
What should I do?

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
I pray that there is no wind or waves

112
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,240
and peace.

113
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Minglan has no one now.

114
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,800
You're the only heir.

115
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,160
Why aren't you going back?

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,240
Power and money.

117
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
are never what I want.

118
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,800
I've promoted Minglan's old employee, Uncle Lin.

119
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
as the CEO.

120
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
let professional people

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,280
Let the professional do it.

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,120
Hello?

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
This is Jinzhou Public Security Bureau.

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
Are you Ms. Wang Yumei's daughter?

125
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Your mother is suspected of gambling.

126
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,680
[I don't have a mom now.] [I don't have a mom.]

127
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,640
I don't have a mom.

128
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,920
Gambling is not a good thing.

129
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,880
You must do your job.

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
Boss.

131
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,600
Teach me how to repair it.

132
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and pray for peace.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,440
Okay.

134
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,080
Get on the boat.

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
Let me introduce myself.

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,920
My name is Jin Xyan.

137
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm here to warn you.

138
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,760
No matter how many prey you have,

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
no matter who they are.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
But please stay as far as my nephew Jin Yelei

141
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
as far as you can.

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,560
Uncle.

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,520
This joke is not funny at all.

144
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,760
I’ve left your dear nephew.

145
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,920
Mr. Jin, you don’t have to be wary of me like a thief.

146
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
If you want to play the game of adults,

147
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,680
don't be so reserved.

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
If you don't know how,

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,560
I can teach you

150
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
teach you.

151
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,400
Mr. Jin.

152
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,760
If you play too much games,

153
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
it won't be fun.

154
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
But you set the trap first.

155
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
Are you

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
scared?

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
Pick me as your teammate.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,040
is better than the enemy.

159
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,520
But if you want to be my stumbling block,

160
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,720
I don’t mind wasting my energy to move you away.

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,840
Mr. Jin.

162
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,640
People in the light

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
should stay in the light.

164
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,080
Don't mess with others.

165
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Don't try to get close to the darkness.

166
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
It will be swallowed by darkness.

167
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
The darker it is,

168
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,560
the more light I can see.

169
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,160
Are you crazy?

170
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,040
Mr. Jin.

171
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,880
I won.

172
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Simon Wang.

173
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,480
Am I on your side?

174
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
Even in mud

175
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,920
we should warm each other.

176
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,800
That way, we have the strength to pursue the bright future.

177
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,800
Thank you.

178
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,240
My umbrella holder.

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,040
The actor.

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,360
