1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,200
Give me five days to think about it.

2
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,880
I've seen your methods.

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,320
There are too many variables.

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,280
Three days.

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Wang Xinyan.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
I don't have to thank Xinyan Wang.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,840
Hold on.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,360
Here you are.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,920
Hold on.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Three minutes.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Please wait.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,120
Is there anything you can tell me?

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
It must be a big news.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Please calm down.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
You'll see.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,880
Everyone,

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm Du Lan, the founder of Minglan Group.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,039
I invited you here today

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,560
to announce something very important.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,920
This is the other daughter of Xie Hae-myung and me.

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,000
Xie Simyeon.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,680
Next,

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,720
of the Cyber City Project.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,039
Please

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,000
wait and see.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Why did you hide this daughter?

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,479
Mr. Xie is over there.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,759
Mr. Xie.

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
Why didn’t you tell me?

30
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,120
Mr. Xie.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
Say something.

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,320
Thank you.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,079
Come on. Come on.

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,560
Be careful.

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Honey.

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
I didn't know Sim-yeon would...

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,520
Simyeon.

38
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,560
Lei.

39
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,120
I just heard that

40
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
you are also the daughter of the Xie family.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,240
My dad didn’t agree to break the engagement between Jin Xie and his family.

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
But if you are the daughter of the Xie family,

43
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,160
I can persuade my dad.

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,519
What?

45
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,160
It's not done yet.

46
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,440
Lei,

47
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,920
We are

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
is not about whether you are engaged or not.

49
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,840
It's not about whether my surname is Wang or Xie.

50
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Have you ever liked me a little bit?

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
Even just a little?

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Li Ronghao: You're a good person. Li Ronghao: You're a good person.

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
You're a good person.

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
You said you never thought about it.

56
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm not that great either.

57
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,159
I am ambitious.

58
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
I don't want to be ordinary.

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
But I hope everything I have

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,120
is earned by my own efforts.

61
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,880
What you can give me now

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,560
you can give me now.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,160
We're from different worlds.

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't ask you to give up everything

65
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,000
for me.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
I can...

67
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Don't make promises that you can't make.

68
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Lei,

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,360
If I weren't Xie Xinyan,

70
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
would you have fought with your parents again?

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,720
If you enjoy the gift from your parents,

72
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,159
you have to be free.

73
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
This is the reality we have to face.

74
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
Why isn't she here yet?

75
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,159
Isn't this Miss Xie?

76
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,400
Amazing.

77
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,760
The whole story

78
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
is all about you.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,560
Now you’re seducing the young master of Jin’s Group.

80
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
Not bad.

81
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,640
If you don't give me money,

82
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
I'll let your company know

83
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,640
know who you are.

84
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,600
The daughter of the Xie family?

85
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,320
She's just an illegitimate daughter.

86
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,680
You can be so shameless

87
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
for money.

88
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,520
No one knows me here.

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
What am I afraid of?

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
You'll never get big money from me.

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
Let me show you the way.

92
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,040
Go there.

93
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,240
I promise you'll get something.

94
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
What is it?

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
You'll know when you get there.

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,680
Remember,

97
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't mess with Xie Haiming.

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,360
Go straight to Du Lan.

99
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,040
It’s free.

100
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,040
I want shares.

101
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,360
In this way,

102
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
you can always be rich.

103
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,880
Why would Du Lan help me?

104
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
Because Minglan's value and reputation

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,640
is far more important than Xie Hae Myung.

106
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Sometimes I wish I was an orphan.

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Are you interested

108
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
to listen to my story?

109
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
Once upon a time,

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,520
there was a little boy

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
who grew up

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,760
grew up together.

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,840
He thought he had no father.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,040
But when he was a teenager,

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,480
the clothes you like.

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,600
What clothes?

117
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,640
Jewelry.

118
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,360
The house.

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,880
Take it.

120
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
Here, Xu Yan.

121
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,280
Call me brother.

122
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,920
Come on

123
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,720
Call me brother.

124
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Dad

125
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
Why do you call me brother

126
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,360
Not uncle

127
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Brother

128
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,960
So now you know

129
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
why I look at Heen.

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm looking at myself.

131
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,280
We're all illegitimate sons who were sold by our own mother for money.

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,440
What I want to say is,

133
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,800
we can't

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,080
choose our parents.

135
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,960
But we can choose the way we want to live.

136
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,360
Sim-yeon.

137
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
Have you really made up your mind?

138
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Let your mother

139
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,040
to deal with your father.

140
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,960
Let them

141
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
Let them solve it themselves.

142
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,680
Isn't it good?

143
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,960
Seriously.

144
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
When will she come out?

145
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,160
You're finally out.

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,960
I've been waiting for you for seven or eight hours.

147
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,800
Are you done?

148
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm done.

149
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,160
Look.

150
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
