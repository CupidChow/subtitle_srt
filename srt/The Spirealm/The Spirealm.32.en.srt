00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:27,460
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,990
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,270
Why are you still in the mood for playing?

4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,400
Don't worry.

5
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,130
I've memorized all the rules.

6
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,310
Take it.

7
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,490
For self-defense.

8
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,050
Isn't this Yan Shihe's knife?

9
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,430
Yes.

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,030
He carried it with him all the time.

11
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,150
It must be useful.

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,910
It's about time.

13
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,190
The tenth door is dangerous.

14
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,070
I'll go in first to check the situation.

15
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,330
You pack up your things

16
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,550
and bring those two kids in.

17
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,550
Okay.

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,030
Get up, stop playing.

19
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,950
Where's your bag?

20
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,510
I forgot my bag.

21
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm leaving first, Yixie.

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,170
Hurry up and come over.

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,750
Lingling.

24
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,910
We don't need to introduce ourselves now?

25
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,030
This is the tenth door.

26
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,740
Surely, none of us came here on our own.

27
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,710
So there's no need for self-introductions.

28
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,110
Okay.

29
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,350
Got it.

30
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,430
Hello.

31
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,870
What took you so long?

32
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,870
Waiting for him.

33
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,950
What's going on?

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,470
There are quite a few people here.

35
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,530
It seems like there are many rookies.

36
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,800
Using rookies as cannon fodder

37
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,330
might work in other doors,

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,910
but in this one,

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,150
it will backfire.

40
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,690
There are actually 18 people.

41
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,250
That woman looks quite familiar.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,190
Xia?

43
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,790
It's her.

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,510
You know her?

45
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,240
The last time I passed the tenth door,

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
it was very challenging.

47
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,030
In the end,

48
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,190
only a woman and I came out,

49
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,470
and that woman was her.

50
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,490
Looks like we've encountered

51
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,990
a rival this time.

52
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,630
I heard a woman crying.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
It has begun.

54
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,470
Is it the Box Demon?

55
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,190
Probably.

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,710
Her voice

57
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,630
is on this floor.

58
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,990
Let's go to the second floor and take a look.

59
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,990
Let's go.

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,320
I didn't expect to see you inside the door.

61
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,870
Last time when I was passing the door,

62
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,510
how come I didn't know

63
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,370
you were the boss of the Obsidian?

64
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,840
There are a lot of things

65
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,850
that you haven't noticed.

66
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,750
Young man, calm down.

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,880
I know you blame us for the death

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,510
of the boss of the White Deer.

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,110
Anyway, now we're inside the same door.

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,470
I'm ready

71
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,770
for whatever you want.

72
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,820
You're in such a hurry to come here and make a fuss

73
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,190
before finding the door and the key?

74
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,830
Both of them will be ours anyway.

75
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,430
The person who lost to me last time seems quite confident this time.

76
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,430
We'll see.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,150
I'll be watching you.

78
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,320
The next door for that woman

79
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,390
is the 11th one.

80
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,970
She's back here now

81
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,950
for the clues to it.

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,790
Ruan.

83
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,710
She seems quite formidable.

84
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,160
She is.

85
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,230
Don't be afraid.

86
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,830
Opening the first box

87
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,870
requires luck.

88
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,230
So, we're all on the same starting line,

89
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,230
right?

90
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,990
I remember this.

91
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,790
The Box Demon can only use skills once a day.

92
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,270
Before using the skill,

93
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,710
the compass will rotate,

94
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,110
like winding up a spring,

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,670
right?

96
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,670
Not bad.

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,520
You remembered everything.

98
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,710
Of course, I can remember such important things.

99
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,110
Lingling, don't forget to keep listening.

100
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,310
Let's go.

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,990
Don't touch it.

102
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,630
I was not opening a box.

103
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,960
This is more important than the boxes.

104
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,070
This must be the safe.

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,740
The key must be inside.

106
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,810
Someone is screaming.

107
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,030
Looks like these rookies are opening the boxes blindly.

108
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,430
Should we remind them?

109
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,450
Let's go. Let's play it by ear.

110
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,310
(Stethoscope. Note: The stethoscope can pick up the sound of the Box Demon or a Box Slave)

111
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,720
You're quite lucky.

112
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,030
You unpacked a prop the first time you tried it.

113
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,510
Really?

114
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,030
What is this prop for?

115
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,630
I told you not to say too much.

116
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,990
Who was screaming just now?

117
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,990
It was me.

118
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,550
My name is Tian Guxue.

119
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,310
I just saw him opening this box,

120
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,550
and I didn't know what was inside.

121
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,750
I got scared

122
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,470
and screamed.

123
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,890
Are you a newcomer?

124
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,630
I brought her in.

125
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,070
I'm Sun Yuanzhou.

126
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,550
This is my tenth door.

127
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,710
They're all my friends.

128
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,510
While some are indeed newcomers,

129
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,390
don't worry,

130
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,960
they are not cannon fodder.

131
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,190
Why are you looking at me?

132
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,120
Everyone I brought in is my friend.

133
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,110
Don't open the boxes casually.

134
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,630
These boxes are everywhere.

135
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,070
They must serve special functions.

136
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,230
It's risky to open them recklessly.

137
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,909
What could go wrong?

138
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,950
I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?

139
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,350
Can you control

140
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,590
the people you brought in?

141
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,790
He just got here today

142
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,030
and is not familiar with the situation.

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Ji,

144
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,470
don't open boxes casually anymore.

145
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,159
If something goes wrong,

146
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,430
it'll be too late.

147
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,670
The higher the risk,

148
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,560
the bigger the benefit.

149
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,830
How dare he open another box?

150
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,270
What is this?

151
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,590
If I'm not mistaken,

152
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,090
this should be the mouth of the Box Demon.

153
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,310
Oh.

154
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,550
Inside this door,

155
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,430
it should be a board game

156
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,790
called "Box Demon."

157
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,790
Don't open boxes like this anymore.

158
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,880
You might unpack terrible things.

159
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

160
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
My mouth

161
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,990
wasn't as fast as your hands.

162
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,310
In other words, inside this door

163
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,309
is a live-action board game.

164
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,640
Have you ever played this game?

165
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,080
At first, I wasn't sure,

166
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,280
so I went upstairs to check.

167
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,669
Now I'm sure.

168
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,970
Inside these boxes in front of us,

169
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,710
there are props and the Box Demon.

170
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,750
If you get a prop,

171
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,510
you can use it against the Box Demon.

172
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,840
If you get a Box Demon...

173
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,270
more precisely,

174
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
one of the ten parts of the Box Demon:

175
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,590
the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, head,

176
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,480
left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot,

177
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,830
and torso.

178
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,760
If you get one of her organs,

179
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,270
it will trigger a certain ability of hers.

180
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,330
If you get her hair,

181
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,810
you will die immediately, turn into a Box Slave,

182
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,110
and become an accomplice of the Box Demon.

183
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,550
If we get her entire body,

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,790
we will all die.

185
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,190
Well...

186
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,710
according to you,

187
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,430
if we don't open the boxes,

188
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,890
nothing will happen to us.

189
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,890
Then we'll be rejecting the game.

190
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
What I just mentioned

191
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,630
are the rules of the board game outside the door.

192
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,390
As for the rules of the game inside the door,

193
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,920
there must be some changes.

194
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,230
However, I still don't know

195
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,560
what these changes are.

196
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,830
But you've unpacked

197
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,830
the mouth,

198
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,500
so now the Box Demon can lie.

199
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,790
Lie?

200
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,590
The Box Demon can speak?

201
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,630
In the board game outside the door, the Box Demon was played by a person.

202
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,960
Of course, it can speak.

203
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,430
As for inside the door...

204
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,990
I guess it can also speak.

205
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,150
Did you notice

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,350
the strange howling

207
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,090
when we just entered the door?

208
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,270
Please, do not open any more boxes, okay?

209
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,910
I didn't know that.

210
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,350
How many boxes

211
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,190
are there in this room?

212
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,010
Let's count them together, shall we?

213
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,380
My name is Yin Xinyi.

214
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,370
I'm passing the door on my own.

215
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,030
Nice to meet you.

216
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,330
My name is Zhu Meng.

217
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,590
You may look young, but you appear to be meticulous

218
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,480
and quite experienced.

219
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,140
I was forced into this state by this stupid game.

220
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,190
Now that everyone knows this is a board game,

221
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,790
let's not randomly touch these boxes anymore.

222
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,270
It's late today.

223
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,110
Everyone, go and have a rest.

224
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,510
What about this mouth?

225
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,310
Since no one wants it,

226
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,670
I'll take it.

227
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,860
(A lying)

228
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,730
(Mouth)

229
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,610
I've checked this villa just now.

230
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,030
The first floor has a hall and a restroom,

231
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,590
and the second floor has a dining room and bedrooms.

232
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,230
You can assign them yourselves.

233
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,670
It's better not to sleep alone

234
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,750
so that you can take care of each other in case something happens.

235
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,750
Sun,

236
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,870
can I have a room to myself?

237
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,470
I'm a bit of a neat freak.

238
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,730
You want to live alone?

239
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,210
Aren't you afraid?

240
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,440
I am.

241
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,830
That's why I won't sleep tonight.

242
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,670
I need to clean the room thoroughly tonight.

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,670
Then be careful on your own.

244
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,030
Okay.

245
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,750
Oh my. There are boxes everywhere.

246
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,910
I have to resist the urge

247
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,910
to touch them.

248
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,040
There are over two hundred boxes in total.

249
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,950
If none of us opens them,

250
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,350
what will happen?

251
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,200
There must be restrictions inside the door.

252
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,950
It won't allow us to exploit such a basic loophole.

253
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,950
And, uh...

254
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,030
what's the use of

255
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,640
that stethoscope earlier?

256
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,150
Outside the door, we've played many times.

257
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,990
Why can't you remember the rules?

258
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,510
If the Box Demon is in the box we're about to open,

259
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,910
the stethoscope can help us hear its sound.

260
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh.

261
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,990
It's quite useful.

262
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,390
If only we had it in our hands.

263
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,400
Can we take it and use it?

264
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,950
I don't think so.

265
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
In the board game,

266
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,920
only the one who unpacked it can use it.

267
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,080
It really is a luck-based game.

268
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,870
But there's one thing very strange.

269
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,390
If this is a game,

270
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,310
there should be a rulebook.

271
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,470
But so far,

272
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,110
no one has mentioned it.

273
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I don't know

274
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,470
if it truly doesn't exist

275
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,200
or if someone has hidden it.

276
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,470
I think

277
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,130
someone has hidden it.

278
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,520
This person doesn't want us to know the rules of the game.

279
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,130
Fortunately, we had the note before coming.

280
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,640
Otherwise, we would still know nothing.

281
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,790
The key is in the floor clock.

282
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,640
We must find out the password as soon as possible.

283
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,830
As for the door,

284
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,030
it should be inside one of the boxes.

285
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,190
We have to open more boxes to find it.

286
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,190
Don't be afraid.

287
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,190
We are lucky.

288
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,200
Ji has already started well for us.

289
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,310
Something happened.

290
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,880
Let's go out and take a look.

291
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,310
Get up. Something happened.

292
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,710
Get up.

293
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,750
No one would think they've lived too long

294
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,070
and open the box secretly, right?

295
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,190
Newcomers can be troublesome

296
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,920
because of their uncertainty.

297
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,120
No one knows

298
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,390
what they'll do.

299
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,670
It's locked!

300
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,950
I'll go find the tools.

301
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,950
Let me do it.

302
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,350
Help me!

303
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,630
Help me!

304
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,270
I don't want to die!

305
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,350
I don't want to die!

306
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,870
Help me!

307
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,780
Help me!

308
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,030
I don't want to die!

309
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,670
Help me!

310
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,990
The upper bunk is clean,

311
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,230
and the lower bunk is messy.

312
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,710
It means two people lived there.

313
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,870
They were gone.

314
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,110
They got hair.

315
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,420
Your people lived here, right?

316
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,470
Yes.

317
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,130
I told you to take care of your men.

318
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,430
They are adults.

319
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,690
No one can stop them from opening the box.

320
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,890
You just want the newcomers to be the cannon fodder.

321
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,730
Now there are two more box slaves.

322
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,030
It's harder to open the box.

323
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,070
Can you guarantee

324
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,590
that no one will die if we don't open the box?

325
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,720
You won't take advantage of this game.

326
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,030
Some people know the rules,

327
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,270
but they don't tell us.

328
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,590
Sooner or later,

329
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,730
you'll be others' cannon fodder.

330
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,780
It's true that showing off your strength will attract attention.

331
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
Go back.

332
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,890
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

333
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,510
Let's go.

334
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,350
We told them

335
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,630
not to open the box,

336
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,030
why didn't they listen?

337
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,540
That woman did it on purpose.

338
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,230
She just wanted them to try and make mistakes.

339
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,350
Now you know the consequences of opening the box indiscriminately.

340
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,610
Brother, don't worry.

341
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,830
Without your permission,

342
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,350
I will never open the box.

343
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,270
I want to go to the lavatory.

344
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,150
I'll go with you.

345
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,750
Lingling.

346
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,670
Lingling.

347
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,110
What's wrong, Zhu Meng?

348
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,570
Didn't you bring tissues?

349
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,110
Help me, Lingling.

350
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,510
What's wrong?

351
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,070
I'm locked in the box.

352
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
Lingling.

353
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,510
Help me!

354
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,550
Zhu Meng.

355
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,030
Lingling.

356
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,430
Zhu Meng.

357
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,950
Help me!

358
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
Lingling.

359
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,860
Help me.

360
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
What's wrong?

361
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,280
What's wrong, Zhu Meng?

362
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,350
Wait for me.

363
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,480
Lingling, hurry up.

364
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,160
I can't hold on any longer.

365
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,470
Help me, Lingling.

366
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,190
Lingling.

367
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,630
Help me, Lingling.

368
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,830
Zhu Meng!

369
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,569
What are you doing?

370
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,910
The mouth.

371
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,400
Do you still have the Box Demon's mouth?

372
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
No.

373
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,390
Something happened?

374
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,390
Yes.

375
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,230
The skill of Box Demon's mouth

376
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,230
is not to lie,

377
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,869
but to use your voice.

378
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,590
He just called for help from inside the box

379
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,990
to lure me to open the box.

380
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,590
You mean

381
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,630
you heard me calling for help inside the box?

382
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,630
Yes.

383
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,990
Where did you hear me calling just now?

384
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,990
Over there.

385
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,150
The second room.

386
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,310
There is indeed a box.

387
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,250
She is most likely inside.

388
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:02,880
Well,

389
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,150
let's confirm her location with Ji.

390
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,030
If it's confirmed,

391
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,030
it'll be safer

392
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,480
to open the other boxes.

393
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Okay.

394
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,650
You mean the Box Demon used the skill of mouth to you?

395
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
That means

396
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,350
the mouth will disappear after being used.

397
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,150
And the Box Demon can only use its skills once a day.

398
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,590
At least tonight,

399
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,950
no one will be killed.

400
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,690
And according to your deduction,

401
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,590
the stethoscope can determine

402
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,130
whether there is a box monster in the box.

403
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,990
Since the stethoscope is so useful,

404
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,520
just listen to the boxes one by one.

405
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,790
There are limits to using props.

406
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,030
Maybe it's a limit on the number of uses.

407
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,360
Maybe it's a time limit.

408
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,270
You can find a box and have a try.

409
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
It has sound.

410
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,030
It really works.

411
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,630
I knew it.

412
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,150
Only the person who got the prop

413
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,150
can use it.

414
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,270
There's no sound in this box.

415
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,470
But

416
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,950
I'm a little scared.

417
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,990
Why don't you open it?

418
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,110
Okay,

419
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,220
but who owns the prop?

420
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,200
Of course, it belongs to us.

421
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,590
The stethoscope is not free.

422
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,960
There's no such good thing.

423
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,230
I take the risk,

424
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,230
and you get the benefits.

425
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,630
I'll do it.

426
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,430
The box is empty.

427
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,870
Come with me to the lavatory.

428
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,870
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

429
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,130
If we miss this chance,

430
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,030
it'll be hard to know where the Box Demon is.

431
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,470
We'll go too.

432
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
This is it.

433
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,960
Try using the stethoscope.

434
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,230
There's a child crying.

435
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,630
Let me use it.

436
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,410
Did you hear anything?

437
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,680
The Box Demon is inside.

438
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,630
She can't move

439
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,730
until her feet are opened.

440
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,070
If you open the key prop,

441
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,870
you can try it on her.

442
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
Ji,

443
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,830
your stethoscope

444
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,570
can be used at least three times a day.

445
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,200
If there is a chance,

446
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,550
try if it can be used for the fourth time.

447
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,470
I'm just lucky.

448
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,470
Ji is always lucky.

449
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,670
Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken him to pass the door.

450
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,670
But

451
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,830
it seems that you're not that lucky.

452
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,940
And we won't let you

453
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,550
use our stethoscope.

454
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,390
Ji, let's go.

455
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,950
Don't let them steal the stethoscope.

456
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,710
They can't use it even if they steal it.

457
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,510
Even if they can't use it,

458
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,440
we will throw it away or destroy it.

459
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,590
You're so thoughtful, Xia.

460
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,450
It's not that I'm thoughtful,

461
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,320
but I know them too well.

462
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,630
Let's go somewhere else.

463
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,390
I don't know

464
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,480
if the stethoscope has any special function.

465
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,670
If it simply amplifies the sound,

466
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,390
then we have

467
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,230
a better one here, right?

468
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,030
There should be other restrictions.

469
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,470
Otherwise, if I can hear everything,

470
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,600
why do we need props?

471
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
Shall we try?

472
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,750
There really is a little girl crying.

473
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,750
Ah?

474
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,490
You can really hear it.

475
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,430
Oh my god.

476
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,710
So we can hear the sounds

477
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,030
in all the boxes?

478
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,710
You wish!

479
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,640
Lingling's hearing must also be limited.

480
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,550
How?

481
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,990
Let me try again.

482
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,110
How is it?

483
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,470
There's no sound in this box.

484
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,000
Then it's empty.

485
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,710
What did I say?

486
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,390
Oh.

487
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,510
You told me not to open the box casually.

488
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,950
Let me do it.

489
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,330
It's really empty.

490
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,670
Let me try again.

491
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Stop trying.

492
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,110
I'm afraid you will be in danger.

493
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,110
It's okay.

494
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,950
You won't know until you try.

495
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,670
What's wrong?

496
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,070
Lingling, what's wrong?

497
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm fine.

498
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,110
I'm fine.

499
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,360
I didn't hear anything.

500
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,070
I just feel like

501
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,840
my eardrums are going to burst.

502
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,590
This...

503
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,240
It seems that

504
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,910
cheating also has a limit on the number of times

505
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,440
just like the stethoscope.

506
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,550
Are you okay?

507
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm fine.

508
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,990
Let's go.

509
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,790
Are you okay?

510
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,950
It's open!

511
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,070
What?

512
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,550
The door is open.

513
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,630
Oh.

514
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,000
Someone is really here.

515
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,040
What are they doing?

516
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,750
The time of the floor clock

517
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,310
is the password for the safe.

518
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,170
They're guessing the time and trying the password.

519
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,510
Is it going to work?

520
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,430
If they insist on trying,

521
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,430
they can succeed.

522
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,270
It's a four-digit number.

523
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,790
There were originally 10,000 possibilities.

524
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,250
But it's a watch password,

525
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,670
so there are only 720 combinations.

526
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,260
If they try once for five seconds,

527
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,830
they will use 3,600 seconds.

528
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,070
They will spend an hour

529
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,740
trying out the password.

530
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,960
And it is the most unlucky situation.

531
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,560
Normally, it will be faster.

532
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,330
No one will try all the numbers

533
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,510
from the beginning to the end,

534
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,310
unless they are really unlucky.

535
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,390
So difficult?

536
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,030
Well,

537
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,270
it's useless for us to get the digital password.

538
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,270
Be quiet.

539
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,150
Hey.

540
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,340
Stop trying.

541
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,920
There won't be such a big loophole in the door.

542
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,270
Don't talk nonsense.

543
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,840
Who are you trying to scare?

544
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,190
It's normal

545
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,030
to try the password for the safe.

546
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,870
Are you jealous?

547
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,710
This is the benefit of having more people.

548
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,370
There is strength in numbers.

549
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,710
What's wrong?

550
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,710
Don't go.

551
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,290
I feel something is wrong.

552
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,710
It's open.

553
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,830
Ah?

554
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,030
It's open?

555
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,830
Didn't you say they would spend an hour?

556
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,560
Besides, how could they cheat?

557
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,030
Oh my god.

558
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,790
If the password is wrong,

559
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,150
the safe is also a box,

560
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,930
and it will swallow people?

561
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,630
Three more Box Slaves

562
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,750
on the first day.

563
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,270
They had no sense of respect

564
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,550
and thought they were the protagonists.

565
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,480
In fact, they are just someone else's cannon fodder.

566
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,110
(Password box) (Hint: The key is in the box.)

567
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,580
Wow.

568
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,230
The treatment is so good this time.

569
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,290
The midnight snacks are so abundant.

570
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,310
Why don't you eat?

571
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,710
I can't.

572
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,430
What?

573
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,990
It really can't be eaten.

574
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,110
I'm not hungry.

575
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,870
You have to eat.

576
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,790
Why are you all looking at me like that?

577
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,850
The food is poisonous.

578
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,230
If we can't eat it,

579
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,670
can we share the food?

580
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,350
Ji, feed him.

581
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,270
What?

582
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,710
We can't eat it,

583
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,430
and only you can touch the food.

584
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,230
We're testing this right now.

585
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,310
Hurry up, feed me.

586
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,970
See if you can share it with me.

587
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,950
Can I feed someone else?

588
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,370
Why are you so nosy?

589
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,390
Feed me. Hurry up.

590
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
Hurry up.

591
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,830
I can't pass it.

592
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,280
I can't reach it either.

593
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,870
If we want to eat, we have to open the box.

594
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,270
I told you there must be a time limit.

595
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,890
The taboo condition for this door is to open the box.

596
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,910
This is to avoid the possibility that

597
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,970
if we don't proactively open the box,

598
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,630
the box demon will not be able to take action against us.

599
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,350
Now it seems that this road is blocked.

600
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,840
If we don't open the boxes, we'll starve to death.

601
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,750
I'm not hungry, but I have to eat something.

602
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,750
Help yourselves.

603
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,430
I'll just starve.

604
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,470
At this time,

605
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,910
you should know

606
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,390
that this is a team game.

607
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,350
We must work together,

608
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,680
otherwise, we'll all die inside the door.

609
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,790
How can we cooperate?

610
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,230
By sharing the information.

611
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,270
Of course, we won't force you to open the box.

612
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,110
You can starve to death if you like to.

613
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,780
But you have to put stickers on the boxes you've opened

614
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,150
to avoid repeated opening

615
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,790
and write what's in the boxes on the stickers.

616
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,990
What?

617
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,470
What's the use of stickers?

618
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,190
Every night after midnight,

619
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,270
everything in the box will be reset.

620
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,630
The stickers are useless.

621
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,630
The things will be reset.

622
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,960
But no props will show up

623
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,740
in the empty boxes that have been opened.

624
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,830
And the hair of the Box Demon

625
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,470
and the Box Slaves transformed by the Box Demon

626
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,550
will randomly show up

627
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,910
in all empty boxes.

628
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,470
So opening an empty box that has been opened once again

629
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,400
only carries risks and no profits.

630
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,910
So the later we open the boxes,

631
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,950
the more dangerous it is.

632
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,150
So we need to

633
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,510
open all the boxes as soon as possible

634
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,640
and find a tool to subdue the Box Demon.

635
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,830
But what if someone deliberately hides it?

636
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,320
Then kick him out of this alliance.

637
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,350
The Box Demon is already troublesome enough.

638
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,390
We can't engage in infighting anymore.

639
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,640
It is dangerous to open the box.

640
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,750
The more people die,

641
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,550
the more box slaves there will be.

642
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,310
But there are profits in risks.

643
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,030
We can't get out of this door

644
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,630
unless we open the box and get the tool to kill the Box Demon

645
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,230
or the password for the safe.

646
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,440
Zhu Meng, you've played this game.

647
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,630
I want to know if the Box Demon can enter the box

648
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,830
that has been opened.

649
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,310
Of course.

650
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,290
She will be able to move

651
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,950
as long as the box with her feet is opened.

652
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,080
She can go anywhere.

653
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,190
Did you hear that?

654
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,030
When we open the box later,

655
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,750
at least two people should work together.

656
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,790
If anything happens,

657
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,870
we can record it.

658
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,950
Any questions?

659
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,340
All the content was told to us by him.

660
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,560
So if he wants to deceive us,

661
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,830
we don't know.

662
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,870
You don't have to believe me.

663
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,910
I don't mind.

664
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,350
If you have any other information,

665
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,870
I don't mind either.

666
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,780
So, we can check the situation

667
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,670
at any time, right?

668
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,910
Yes.

669
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,790
But equally, we also need to check

670
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,170
the box you opened.

671
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,950
Okay, we can cooperate.

672
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,130
But I reserve the right to stop it at any time.

673
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,030
Whatever.

674
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,800
We might be the ones to end cooperation first.

675
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,630
I'll share the stickers with you.

676
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,470
If you find any important props

677
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,790
or the Box Demon's skills,

678
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,250
make sure to speak up. Don't keep it a secret.

679
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,190
From now on, let's exchange information

680
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,450
here every day at noon.

681
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,510
We won't eat today.

682
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,910
We'll wait until Lingling finishes listening to and opening the box tomorrow

683
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,110
before having a meal.

684
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,000
It's okay to starve for one day.

685
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,870
If the box is opened incorrectly,

686
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,330
our lives might be at risk.

687
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,710
Hang in there.

688
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,989
This door is really unfriendly to newbies.

689
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,909
Indeed.

690
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,190
Hopefully, the newbies

691
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,989
won't impulsively open the box.

692
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,679
Otherwise, it will be even more challenging.

693
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,429
Xia will definitely take action.

694
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,230
Let's be careful.

695
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,949
At this point,

696
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,989
does she still have a way not to open the box?

697
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:43,949
I'm just hungry.

698
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,070
I can endure it.

699
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,790
I'm fine too.

700
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,480
I can endure hunger.

701
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,389
Hang in there. We'll eat tomorrow morning.

702
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,190
I might even eat the plate by tomorrow morning.

703
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,270
Bro, go to sleep.

704
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,350
If you don't sleep now, hunger might keep you awake.

705
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,010
Go to sleep.

706
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,600
In your dreams, you can dream about anything.

707
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,870
Take it. You get one, I get one.

708
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Just one piece?

709
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,870
Yes, so we'll have to let them go hungry.

710
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,030
Thank you.

711
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,310
Is it sweet?

712
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,990
Yes.

713
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,910
What about you?

714
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,880
I also think it's sweet.

715
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,670
Xia, I want to go out.

716
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,280
I don't want to open the box.

717
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,110
I want to leave. I want to live.

718
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,910
It's useless. You can't get out.

719
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,290
But you clearly said you would protect us past the door.

720
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,310
Must I fulfill every promise I make?

721
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,030
I've made too many.

722
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,880
You'll have to wait in line.

723
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,750
You'd better calm down.

724
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,590
Are you trying to use us as cannon fodder?

725
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,110
Not you all, just you.

726
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,350
I've brought many people through the door.

727
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,550
Surely there will be classifications.

728
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,970
You just play your role as cannon fodder.

729
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,430
After passing the door,

730
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,520
I can arrange a decent farewell ceremony for you.

731
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,990
Xia, why did you bring me to the study?

732
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,160
It's past midnight,

733
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,630
the stethoscope can be used.

734
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,690
I need to find a box.

735
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,710
Wait, I...

736
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,110
I just heard you arguing,

737
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,360
and saw you meeting a mysterious man.

738
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,950
You must have some plans,

739
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,630
and I want to know.

740
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,430
I don't want to be cannon fodder.

741
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,890
You're indeed smarter than I thought.

742
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,350
Let me tell you,

743
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,510
I have the note for this door,

744
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,970
and I know the rules for all the games.

745
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,750
If you want to live, do as I say.

746
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,910
Then why did you listen to Zhu Meng?

747
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,190
Pushing him to the front, so that I can shift everyone's attention.

748
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,720
It's easier for me to do things in the shadows.

749
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,850
There's no movement here.

750
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,390
Really.

751
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,510
If you don't open it, I'll open it.

752
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,840
After I open it, don't come looking for me.

753
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,230
Can the stethoscope hear if there are any props?

754
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,590
The stethoscope can only detect whether there is sound or not,

755
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,920
avoiding the Box Demon.

756
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,870
What are you looking for?

757
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,750
A comb that can kill the Box Demon.

758
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,670
If we find it,

759
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,230
we'll be invincible.

760
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,570
What are you doing?

761
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,630
Lingling, let's open the box.

762
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,630
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

763
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,760
Zhu Meng didn't allow me to wake you up.

764
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,230
Let's go.

765
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,230
Okay.

766
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,210
This one is silent.

767
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,750
This one is empty.

768
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
(Opened, empty)
