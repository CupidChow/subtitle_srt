00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:27,320
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,830
(Episode 3)

3
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,079
Sorry

4
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,320
for disturbing you.

5
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,110
No.

6
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,350
My hearing is too good.

7
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,750
I couldn't save that girl.

8
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,940
What a shame.

9
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,750
You look sad.

10
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,470
It's not just about Wang Xiaoyi, right?

11
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,550
That's right.

12
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,030
I didn't save my daughter either.

13
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,740
If she were still alive,

14
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,870
she should be about your age.

15
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,230
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,990
How did she...

17
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Wolf plague.

18
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Back then...

19
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,390
Look.

20
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,470
The snow is beautiful tonight.

21
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,950
My daughter loved snow the most.

22
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,230
Yeah.

23
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,950
The snow is so beautiful.

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,270
The snow brought you to tears?

25
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,430
How rare.

26
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,950
It's no good to lean on the railing alone.

27
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,430
Very unsafe.

28
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,230
By the way, Madame,

29
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,680
this is my good friend.

30
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,850
He has a kind heart.

31
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,170
I fear that he'll run into some
villainous hypocrites.

32
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,910
Please watch him for me.

33
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,450
Don't let others harm him.

34
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
Of course.

35
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,230
Well, you guys have a good chat.

36
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,829
I have to go.

37
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,990
It's soaked in blood.

38
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Who cares?

39
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,270
Shall we move it to the patriarch?

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,130
Let's try and see if we can move it.

41
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,630
Come on.

42
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,390
It's so light.

43
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,120
It's even more wicked than that thing.

44
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,190
Let's send it to the patriarch.

45
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,030
Come on,

46
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,390
are you serious now?

47
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,930
Are you really moving it away?

48
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,830
The carpenter said,

49
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,230
the key is in the coffin.

50
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,590
Just open the coffin and get the key.

51
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,690
It's not a trap, right?

52
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,110
Give me a hand.

53
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,230
The coffin is so light,

54
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,490
but the lid is so heavy.

55
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,150
Take it.

56
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,590
Is this the key?

57
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,950
Looks normal.

58
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,150
What?

59
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,130
Do you need background music too?

60
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,110
Ruan Baijie is so kind to you.

61
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,360
Usually, the one who get the key

62
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,310
will be the first to open the door

63
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,090
and get a direct clue of the next door.

64
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,430
It's like you're halfway to the next door.

65
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,230
Alright, everyone is happy now.

66
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,550
I'll be kind again

67
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,680
and tell you where the door is.

68
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,170
You found the door?

69
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,030
Of course.

70
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,030
Where is it?

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,950
In the well.

72
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,950
In the well?

73
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,570
Are you kidding me?

74
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,470
The monster is still in the well.

75
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,240
It's not your first time crossing the door.

76
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,430
Don't you know that

77
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,909
the door is most likely to be

78
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,630
where monsters exist?

79
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,120
The monster is in the well.

80
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,230
How can we find the door?

81
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,230
Easy.

82
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,430
Feed her a dead thing.

83
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,630
When she's full,

84
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,430
we will get through the door.

85
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,150
What dead things do we have here to feed her?

86
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,750
You don't. But I do.

87
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,310
Take a break.

88
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,480
Can we see the door when we go down?

89
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,830
I have to tell you something.

90
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,690
Aren't you gonna do it now?

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,370
The door will open soon.

92
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,740
Why are you waiting for?

93
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,920
If you don't do it, when the door opens,

94
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,950
the clue will fall into Ling Jiushi's hands.

95
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,810
What should we tell the boss then?

96
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,390
I just think that

97
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,590
we shouldn't fight with Ling Jiushi.

98
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,310
There is no should or shouldn't.

99
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,680
If we fail to finish our task,

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,590
we will be miserable when we get back.

101
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,720
Let's play it by ear.

102
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,010
Why are you acting so mysterious?

103
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,470
Well,

104
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,390
I still think this is too precious.

105
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,790
I want to return it to you.

106
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,190
I gave it to you.

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,030
It's yours.

108
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,630
Anything else?

109
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,480
Is Ruan Baijie your alias?

110
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,790
Of course.

111
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,150
You want to know my real name?

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,170
What's wrong? Are you reluctant to leave me?

113
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,430
No, I don't mean anything else.

114
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,090
I just want to return it to you.

115
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,350
Let's go.

116
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,200
They are rushing us.

117
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,510
Can we go down now?

118
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,030
Yes.

119
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,230
Don't move.

120
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,750
Let's go.

121
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,070
Hurry! Open the door!

122
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,030
Goodbye, my friends.

123
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,090
Stop being emotional.

124
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,270
Let me help you.

125
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,470
Keep up!

126
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,550
It's all your fault.

127
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,830
You were dilly-dallying.

128
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,030
The key shouldn't be given to you.

129
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,230
What should we do now?

130
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,850
In that situation,

131
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,080
can you keep it safe?

132
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,390
Right, it's all my fault.

133
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,600
I will think of a way.

134
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,630
There's wind in the cave.

135
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,750
This cave is an arc,

136
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,930
so there's a swirl.

137
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,500
If we can eliminate interference,

138
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,590
we'll find the way.

139
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,920
Where did you get this lighter?

140
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,110
Why do you care?

141
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,080
I got it from the previous game.

142
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,440
Are you done analysing?

143
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,630
Go that way.

144
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,630
How did you know that?

145
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
There is an arrow.

146
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,230
Are you really gonna follow the arrow?

147
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,230
You don't even know who left it here.

148
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,550
It's up to you.

149
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,990
There are many tunnels here.

150
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,590
It must be a public underground
defence facility.

151
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,920
No one would dig all these tunnels for fun.

152
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,280
If you don't want to go, just stay here.

153
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
You...

154
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,190
What should we do now?

155
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,650
We can't even find the key.

156
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,390
Forget the key,

157
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,670
how can we get out now?

158
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,430
Let's go.

159
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,590
This seems to be the shelter where

160
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,920
the villagers hid during the wolf plague.

161
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,450
This quilt looks so familiar.

162
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,390
Yeah.

163
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,160
I think I've seen it somewhere.

164
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,590
Look at this.

165
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,000
It looks like a child's doodle.

166
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,830
No kid dares to draw here.

167
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,610
Could it be that thing's drawing?

168
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,520
The one who drew this

169
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,480
must be very lonely.

170
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,670
You're so sensitive.

171
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,440
Hurry, let's get out of this place.

172
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,350
Let's go.

173
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,150
This is the fourth time

174
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,140
but I've never seen this before.

175
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,070
The Door Ghost took the key.

176
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,960
I don't know what to do now.

177
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,150
Just stay alive.

178
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,950
We still don't know

179
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,680
what the taboo conditions are.

180
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,270
Usually, there's only one taboo condition.

181
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,710
and there are patterns.

182
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,270
This time, we have various conditions.

183
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,800
I can't figure it out at all.

184
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,910
It means there are many taboo conditions.

185
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,430
Even if there are many,

186
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,150
there has to be a pattern.

187
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,550
Sorry, guys.

188
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,910
I lost the key.

189
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,110
I think our top priority now

190
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,470
is to work together

191
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,670
and find a way out.

192
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,170
There are only four of us left.

193
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,070
Who knows the conditions? Let's share them.

194
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,510
I don't want to lose any of us again.

195
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,030
Who would share the clues?

196
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,830
Interesting.

197
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,790
You look smart

198
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,150
but you sound silly.

199
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,910
Don't you know that fortune favours fools?

200
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,360
Since we entering the door,

201
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,740
the female ghost has taken four actions.

202
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,030
On the first night,

203
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,550
Wu died alone on the rooftop.

204
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,430
The second day,

205
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,670
we went up the mountain to cut trees.

206
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,870
Three of us carried the tree

207
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,310
and were killed by the female ghost.

208
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,070
Zhang Zishuang entered the temple at night

209
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,240
and was killed by the female ghost.

210
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,310
Cheng Wen, Wang Xiaoyi.

211
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,910
Wang Xiaoyi was alone by the well,

212
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,230
but the female ghost didn't show up.

213
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,970
When Cheng Wen went there,

214
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,120
the female ghost appeared.

215
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,870
One, three, one, two.

216
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,750
The clue seems to be related to the numbers.

217
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
No.

218
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,600
Not only the number,

219
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,470
One, railing.

220
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,070
Three, tree.

221
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,510
One, temple.

222
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,510
Two, well.

223
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,350
One person doesn't enter the temple.

224
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,790
Two people don't look at the well.

225
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,650
Three people don't hold the tree.

226
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,510
One person doesn't lean on the railing.

227
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,710
I was right about you.

228
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,950
I am right?

229
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,910
You already knew the clues of this door?

230
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,510
You denied it when I asked you that day.

231
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,870
Do you know how many will die because of it?

232
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
Ridiculous.

233
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,310
It's that monster that killed them.

234
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,970
What does it have to do with me?

235
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,150
But you already know the taboo conditions.

236
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,030
Why didn't you say anything?

237
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,030
Say anything?

238
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,250
I hope the person I saved is worth saving.

239
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,190
Think about it.

240
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,750
I warned us before entering the temple.

241
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,030
Listen to me or not, it's up to them.

242
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,030
It's not my job

243
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,540
to make an effort to save them.

244
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Besides,

245
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,830
you are experienced.

246
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,870
Didn't anyone try to hurt you in the door?

247
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,850
And you want me to share clues?

248
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:01,670
What?

249
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,670
If I say I have it two days ago,

250
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,910
would you believe me?

251
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,970
You're questioning me now

252
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,589
because you were threatened.

253
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,440
When Wang Xiaoyi was in trouble,

254
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,910
I didn't see you guys so riled up.

255
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,230
Enough!

256
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,290
I'll lure the monster out.

257
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,950
- OK. - No.

258
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,030
Since we've got the taboo conditions,

259
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,150
we can't get out

260
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,630
if we avoid them.

261
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,310
We'll die either way.

262
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,510
It's better to set a trap

263
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,850
and lure the monster out
with taboo conditions.

264
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,470
Maybe we still have a chance
to get the key back.

265
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,700
No, Xiong.

266
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,870
I disagree.

267
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,750
What?

268
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,870
Do you want to negotiate with that monster?

269
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,090
As long as she lives, we can't get out.

270
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,870
It's better than waiting for death.

271
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,510
She seems to be afraid of fire.

272
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,830
I saved Ruan Baijie with fire before.

273
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,190
Although you can't bless me to go out,

274
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,390
I still hope everything goes well.

275
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,310
Go!

276
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,230
Xiong.

277
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,030
Run!

278
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,670
Come at me!

279
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,750
I've seen your painting.

280
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,000
You...

281
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,870
I...

282
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,990
I've seen your...

283
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,470
your painting.

284
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,070
You must be very lonely too.

285
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,350
You fought so fiercely just now.

286
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,350
How's your wound?

287
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,950
What wound?

288
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,790
Right.

289
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,390
It seems to be torn.

290
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
Where is it?

291
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,830
Wow.

292
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,390
It recovered so fast.

293
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,630
So fast.

294
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,630
I have a question.

295
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,990
Just now...

296
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,030
No.

297
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,990
More than just now,

298
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,260
for many times,

299
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,040
why did you protect me?

300
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,870
You need to get used to others' kindness.

301
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,870
Pretending to be hurt is a part of it?

302
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,790
This is because...

303
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,950
It's fun.

304
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,550
To bring us closer.

305
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,800
But you didn't protect others.

306
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,410
You chose to protect me

307
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,710
just for fun?

308
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,110
Fine, fine.

309
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,670
You're a talent.

310
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,230
I want you to join the Obsidian.

311
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,830
What is that?

312
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,590
The organization I established

313
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,250
to help people break the door.

314
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Boosting?

315
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,430
You can say that.

316
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,350
But the real situation is more complicated.

317
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,670
I can get it no matter how complicated.

318
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,670
You know that.

319
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,190
I told you I was a game maker.

320
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,190
Again?

321
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,830
But I can't express it clearly with words.

322
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,830
Think about it.

323
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,290
You'll understand

324
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,750
after getting involved.

325
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,190
But, am I that good?

326
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,230
Really?

327
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,560
Why didn't I realise it?

328
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,430
Come here.

329
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,690
Because you have light in you.

330
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,590
What?

331
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,790
Let me ask you something.

332
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,570
You gave it to me because you wanted me in?

333
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
No.

334
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,870
Because you're you.

335
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,430
You're not talking properly again.

336
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,250
By the way, what spell did you recite?

337
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,030
A lonely child?

338
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,080
You're also a lonely child?

339
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,600
I don't want to talk about this.

340
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,530
I don't understand

341
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,080
why she suddenly let us go.

342
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,570
Don't you think the landlady is suspicious?

343
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,870
What did you find?

344
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,230
Do you remember the man

345
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,430
who died on the rooftop on the first day?

346
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,830
I heard a cry that night.

347
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,990
So Wu went to the rooftop

348
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,630
when he heard the cry of the landlady.

349
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,560
He accidentally leaned on the rail

350
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
and violated the taboo conditions.

351
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,750
Right.

352
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,850
Don't enter the temple by one.

353
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,510
Don't look at the well by two.

354
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,630
Don't hold the tree as a trio. Don't lean on the rail alone.

355
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,830
Wu didn't know he can't lean on the rail.

356
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,150
Did the landlady deliberately lure him

357
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,400
to break the taboo conditions?

358
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,210
I don't think it's just for Wu,

359
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,310
it's for all of us.

360
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,790
If Ke was one step ahead of Wu,

361
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,640
Ke will be the one who dies.

362
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,270
I remember it now.

363
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
On the day they went up to cut down trees,

364
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,690
the landlady said something to those three.

365
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,150
Then they triggered the taboo conditions.

366
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,270
And there's the second time.

367
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,870
When we went up the mountain,

368
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,110
the landlady reminded us

369
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,950
to divide the remaining six into two groups.

370
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,260
There are six of you.

371
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,050
Two groups of three.

372
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,630
If you carry a tree by three,

373
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,790
you can finish it in one day.

374
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,870
That makes sense.

375
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,030
Right.

376
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,360
And Wang Xiaoyi agreed.

377
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,990
When we were pulling trees together,

378
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,020
She wanted to help.

379
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,750
Let me help you.

380
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,750
No need.

381
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,350
We can do it.

382
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,990
Ruan Baijie knew the rule so he stopped her.

383
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,630
Speaking of Wang Xiaoyi, I remembered that

384
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,430
when she was chased by Cheng Wen,

385
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,920
the landlady said she can hide in the well.

386
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,870
That's why she looked the well with Cheng.

387
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,030
There's a well over there.

388
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,230
We were hiding inside when the wolves came.

389
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,230
Go in and hide.

390
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,910
Go.

391
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,990
And the temple.

392
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,490
It's also the landlady.

393
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,790
You must follow the rules

394
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,330
to go inside one by one.

395
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,950
It seems that

396
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,110
the landlady was trying to lure us

397
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,090
to violate the taboo conditions.

398
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,230
Not only this,

399
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,590
she seems to take good care of that monster.

400
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,750
Be careful.

401
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,930
Thank you, Madame.

402
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,870
But why did she do that?

403
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,550
If someone dies,

404
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,140
she can feed that monster.

405
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,550
There're so many people in the village.

406
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,720
Why did she do that?

407
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,950
Does she

408
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,320
have something to do with that thing?

409
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,710
You're so sad,

410
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,160
not because of Wang Xiaoyi, right?

411
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,270
That's right.

412
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,350
I didn't save my daughter back then.

413
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,750
If she were still alive,

414
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,790
she should be about your age.

415
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,750
If the monster is her daughter,

416
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,930
can everything be explained?

417
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,590
That sounds logical.

418
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,830
But we need evidence.

419
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,670
I've seen it.

420
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,150
The style is blurry,

421
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,030
but from the background and the composition,

422
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,360
the painting on the wall

423
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,770
should be those persons in the photo.

424
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,110
Can't believe they are a couple.

425
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,790
They don't look like one at all.

426
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,360
How could the daughter of those two

427
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,790
be the monster?

428
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,240
When we find the reason,

429
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,200
we can really negotiate with the monster.

430
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,830
If she were still alive,

431
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,550
she should be about your age.

432
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,670
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,510
What happened?

434
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,230
Wolf plague.

435
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,120
It could be related to the wolf plague.

436
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,790
Now we know the landlady and the Chief,

437
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,790
we'll have the answer if we ask them.

438
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,990
Let's go.

439
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,430
Where is the landlady?

440
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
If your daughter becomes a monster,

441
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,830
what would you do?

442
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,670
What should we do now?

443
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,910
There's one more person who may know.

444
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,830
I didn't know why.

445
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,190
Before that day,

446
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,590
just a few wolves came at night.

447
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,790
But that night, a group of wolves came.

448
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,820
I'm not the Chief.

449
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,030
But I know

450
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,050
it was the hardest choice.

451
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,590
To choose one person,

452
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,630
his daughter,

453
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,880
or all the villagers who are not related?

454
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,710
Stop playing. Come on.

455
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,710
Come on.

456
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,440
Have some drumsticks.

457
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,430
- Put it here. - All right.

458
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,830
You got it.

459
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,710
Let's eat.

460
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,790
It's getting cold.

461
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,230
Try this.

462
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,070
- Yours. - How is it?

463
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,110
Is it good?

464
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,310
I haven't tasted yet.

465
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,950
Try it.

466
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,200
The wolves are coming.

467
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,430
Run!

468
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,990
Wolf!

469
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,270
The wolves are here again.

470
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,730
Go down the well, quickly!

471
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,470
Hurry up.

472
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,270
My kaleidoscope.

473
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,270
Get down the well.

474
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,110
Hurry up.

475
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,350
And this child.

476
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,310
Chief, hurry up.

477
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,030
You go first.

478
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,030
What about you?

479
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,750
- When everyone's here... - My kaleidoscope.

480
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,950
put back the manhole cover.

481
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,340
Jiu! Jiu! Come here!

482
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,030
Jiu! Jiu!

483
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,790
Jiu! What're you doing?

484
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,710
Jiu! Hurry up!

485
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,870
If it's not covered, the whole clan will die.

486
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,430
Help me, Dad!

487
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,470
Jiu!

488
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,390
Jiu! Jiu!

489
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,710
The Chief wanted to chase them.

490
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,910
We dragged him back.

491
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,030
Since then,

492
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,190
the wolves never came.

493
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,670
But everyone in the village said

494
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,710
Jiu saved the whole tribe by herself.

495
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,190
It's worth it.

496
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,430
Of course you think it's worth it.

497
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,950
You're not the one who died.

498
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,430
Sacrifice someone for others.

499
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,520
Have you ever think of the one's feelings?

500
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,310
But Jiu also ate so many people.

501
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,770
There's no real fairness.

502
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,440
How's the relationship betweeen the couple?

503
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,070
How can it be?

504
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,750
Jiu is a monster now.

505
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,920
She can't live or die.

506
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,730
Landlady doesn't want to see the Chief anymore.

507
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,030
She even opened a hotel

508
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,030
to receive door-breakers like you.

509
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,440
The Chief has had a hard time

510
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,190
for all these years.

511
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,910
He often told us,

512
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,030
after getting the affairs of the clan done,

513
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,450
he'd kill himself to be with his daughter

514
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,190
as a punishment for all of these.

515
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,830
So,

516
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,510
the coffin was left for himself.

517
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,670
Why didn't you stop him?

518
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,910
I feel very guilty

519
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,720
for Jiu's death.

520
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,430
Why let the Chief live a miserable life?

521
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
So,

522
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,670
the Chief asked us to make the coffin,

523
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,520
which is actually for himself.

524
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,430
He wanted to commit suicide.

525
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,790
Maybe he's dead now.

526
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,150
But we can't stop him.

527
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,030
In order to raise the monster daughter,

528
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,630
the landlady has been luring us into traps.

529
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,310
But now we know all of these,

530
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,310
how does it help?

531
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,170
Kidnap the Chief and the landlady

532
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,710
and force the monster to submit.

533
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,590
She's already unconscious.

534
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,190
Even if she was conscious,

535
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,190
Jiushi.

536
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,630
blood is thicker than water.

537
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,790
Jiushi.

538
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,820
Jiushi.

539
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,310
There are many people asking for help.

540
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,350
I'll go check.

541
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,870
Are you all right?

542
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,510
I'm fine.

543
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,430
Just thinking about something.

544
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,880
What should we do now?

545
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,990
To solve the problem,

546
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,360
we need to gather the three of them.

547
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,070
How's that possible?

548
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,750
It's over.

549
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,949
It's all over.

550
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,989
The wolves are coming.

551
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Hurry up!

552
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Run!

553
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,270
Be careful.

554
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,270
What happened?

555
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,110
What happened?

556
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,270
What happened?

557
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,430
What happened?

558
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,430
What happened?

559
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,230
Are the wolves really here again?

560
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,390
I don't know, Chief.

561
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,230
Go down. Hurry up.

562
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,510
Come on.

563
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,990
What's going on?

564
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,830
Why do the wolves come again?

565
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,590
The Chief is here.

566
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,430
Chief! Chief!

567
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,070
What... what's going on?

568
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,510
Welcome.

569
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,110
Did you play tricks?

570
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,310
Don't say that.

571
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,630
We don't plan to play tricks.

572
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,510
Our aim is that monster.

573
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,960
How dare you!

574
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Madame,

575
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,780
we know about the whole thing.

576
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,490
Whether it's what happened a year ago in the village

577
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,510
or you lured us to break the rules,

578
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,710
it's just our guess.

579
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,960
We have no actual evidence.

580
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,440
And I don't want to take revenge on you.

581
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,550
I just want to change something.

582
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,270
What do you want?

583
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,390
Our key

584
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,590
is with that monster.

585
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
We want that back.

586
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,070
You can even abandon your daughter.

587
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,430
Can't you admit that she is a monster?

588
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,760
Why not?

589
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,670
I can't control her.

590
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,590
No one can control her.

591
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,690
We're willing to give it a try.

592
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,070
The taboo condictions

593
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,030
that Madame has lured us.

594
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,990
Don't enter the temple alone. Don't look at the well in a pair.

595
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,190
Don't hold the tree as a trio. Don't lean on the rail alone.

596
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,870
Xiong Qi, Ke.

597
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,030
Jiu. Jiu.

598
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,390
You three

599
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,110
haven't seen each other for a long time.

600
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,830
Jiu, I'm here to help you.

601
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,760
To help you get rid of your loneliness.

602
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,350
About your past,

603
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,870
I've all known.

604
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,310
I know how you feel.

605
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,760
You're not dead yet,

606
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,950
but you're not alive.

607
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,260
Although you seems alive,

608
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,400
your heart is already dead.

609
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,470
I'm just like you.

610
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,470
I mean I feel the same way as you.

611
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,220
I can feel that loneliness.

612
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,110
Hey, you.

613
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,970
What are those sappy words?

614
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,920
Between the lives of the tribe and Jiu,

615
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,440
of course we choose the lives of the whole tribe.

616
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
If you can be the one to choose,

617
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,140
you'll certainly feel relieved.

618
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,750
What if you are the chosen one?

619
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,470
I... I'd like to.

620
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,750
Really?

621
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,670
We'll kill you now

622
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,430
and save the whole tribe.

623
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,990
Will you do it?

624
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,070
Yes, I do.

625
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,430
I'll strangle you to feed Jiu.

626
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,550
All of you think you should sacrifice Jiu.

627
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,260
You think your daughter

628
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,810
should sacrifice for the whole village.

629
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,830
And you.

630
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,510
You think you should choose the majority.

631
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,710
But there are not so many things

632
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,570
that should be done in this world.

633
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,070
You've all made your choice.

634
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,070
She has to bear the consequences.

635
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,070
Why?

636
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,250
Just because it should be?

637
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,590
Jiu lives in this dark cellar.

638
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,790
She can't live or die.

639
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,590
She can only depend on her mother

640
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,680
to lure door-breakers to survive.

641
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,390
Who wants to live like this?

642
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,470
Anyone?

643
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,750
It's all my fault.

644
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,630
She has endured it for so many years.

645
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,190
Do you think it'll pass in a word?

646
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,470
I've made a choice.

647
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,440
I'll kill myself to go with her.

648
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,510
Didn't you make the coffin for me?

649
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,130
Your daughter doesn't want you to die.

650
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,120
She wants you to accompany her, Chief.

651
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,270
Shouldn't you apologize to her?

652
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,990
And you.

653
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,470
As a mother,

654
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,510
for your daughter,

655
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,840
you shouldn't have killed so many people.

656
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,150
All of you are making choices for Jiu.

657
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,990
But did any of you

658
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,150
care about her feelings

659
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,280
and her loneliness?

660
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,470
Jiu.

661
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,590
I...

662
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,150
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
Jiu.

664
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,390
We should...

665
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,390
We should thank you.

666
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,510
Jiu.

667
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,140
Thank you.

668
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Thank you, Jiu.

669
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,630
Thank you, Jiu.

670
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,950
Thank you.

671
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,110
Thank you so much.

672
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,590
Thank you, Jiu.

673
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,030
Thank you for saving us.
