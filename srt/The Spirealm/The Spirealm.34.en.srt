00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,390
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,030
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,080
Lingling never relies on luck for anything.

4
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,770
You should keep your mouth shut.

5
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,509
I got it.

6
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,700
This door challenge is set in the 19th century.

7
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,900
At that time, not every part of the world

8
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,430
divided a day into 24 hours.

9
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,010
So now the order of the numbers indicates

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,710
that the time is 06:37.

11
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,150
I need to align the clock with the combination.

12
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,579
It's opened!

13
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,670
Lingling, you're amazing!

14
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,060
You're truly admirable.

15
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,630
Can you tell me

16
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,420
how you chose between

17
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,620
1,7, 3, 8 and 1, 8, 3, 7?

18
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,500
In my opinion,

19
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,870
this Box Demon is a woman after all.

20
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,110
She might hate the sound of 3 and 8 combined as it's a degrading nickname in Chinese for women.

21
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,250
I was just being lucky.

22
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,590
Having good luck is actually a strength.

23
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,100
Stop! Don't open the box.

24
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm not gonna open the box. I just wanna get the key.

25
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,430
Stay back.

26
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,670
What are we gonna do with the key?

27
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,110
The key...

28
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,300
You got it out of the safe. It's yours.

29
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Thanks.

30
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,350
However,

31
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,860
I can't take this key with me.

32
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,980
The key is very important.

33
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,470
If you don't take it with you, where will you place it?

34
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,360
In a door challenge,

35
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,660
once players are dead,

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,320
the props they're carrying will disappear too.

37
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,740
If I take this key with me,

38
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,870
I'll become the Box Demon's target.

39
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,850
Should anything happen to me,

40
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,330
what are you gonna do with the key's gone too?

41
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,880
Well...

42
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,550
Why don't we put the key back into the safe,

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,510
and get it out again when we find the exit?

44
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,620
It won't work.

45
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,340
Once the safe is closed,

46
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,200
the combination will be reset.

47
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,480
In that case, we'll have to figure out the new combination.

48
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,940
Forget it. I'll keep the key then.

49
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,110
We've found the key.

50
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,680
As long as we find the exit,

51
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,180
though we can't defeat the Box Demon,

52
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,780
we'll still be able to get out through the exit.

53
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,580
The board game in the real world

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,420
says that the exit is in an subterranean passage

55
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,350
whose entrance is hidden in a box.

56
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,260
We have to continue opening boxes.

57
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,870
Opening more boxes?

58
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,470
Yes.

59
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,620
What kind of stupid game is this?

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,960
Anyway, we haven't lost our hopes yet.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,590
Let's stick to the same old rule.

62
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,590
We'll discuss in private about the clues that can help us get out of here.

63
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,860
We haven't found the mole planted by the Box Demon yet.

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,740
If that mole

65
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,950
has already discovered the exit tunnel,

66
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,950
what should we do?

67
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
Let's suppose

68
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,100
the mole has found out the subterranean passage,

69
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,960
and put an irrelevant label on it.

70
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,440
How will we deal with it?

71
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,160
What are we gonna do?

72
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,500
Wait. Why are you all looking at me?

73
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,000
We can't count on my luck to lead us to the exit tunnel, can we?

74
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,290
Get out of the room with me.

75
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,480
To the toilet again?

76
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,310
We're safe here. Say it.

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,830
You can trust that I'm not the mole,

78
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,900
and I can trust that you're not it either, right?

79
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,150
Yes, we're on the same side.

80
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,660
Given that, I need you help me find out the mole.

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,870
Sure. But how can I help?

82
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,640
What does this mean?

83
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,020
As I said, you're a master at this game.

84
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,620
What? Do I need to be more explicit?

85
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,630
I did tamper with it.

86
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,380
It's a prop I brought here from the outside.

87
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,870
It's just something I can fall back on.

88
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,390
Now this thing has come in handy.

89
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
The credit

90
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,060
of finding out the mole actually goes to it.

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,500
Are you sure who that is now?

92
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,660
I do have an idea, but I need more proof.

93
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,380
That person doesn't seem very intelligent.

94
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,630
Why would the Box Demon make such a choice?

95
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,400
If the Box Demon had chosen me,

96
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,110
this door challenge would be more interesting.

97
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,140
I could kill all of you anytime.

98
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,270
Stop it. You're not that kind of person.

99
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,750
What are you gonna do then?

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,750
It's simple.

101
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll reopen all the boxes this person has opened.

102
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,750
Isn't that a huge waste of time?

103
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,230
Do you have a better idea?

104
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,070
Not really.

105
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,760
It's true that this is not a smart way,

106
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,750
but at least it can assure us

107
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
that what we're doing isn't in vain.

108
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,700
I lied about having the comb.

109
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,050
Sun Yuanzhou's reaction has proved that he's not the mole.

110
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,510
At least, before we can find the exit, he won't be a threat to us.

111
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,950
On the other hand,

112
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,710
we can use this prop of Sun Yuanzhou's

113
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,860
to find out who the mole really is.

114
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,060
Now I have a suspect.

115
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,720
If my guess is correct,

116
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,950
then I'm sure this person isn't very intelligent.

117
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,670
That's good.

118
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,550
I can take him or her down myself.

119
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
Just shut up.

120
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,780
Judging from the current situation,

121
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,789
I guess everyone can only open a certain number of boxes every day.

122
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,789
Even the mole

123
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,900
can't open boxes without limit.

124
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,470
Then if we count the number

125
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,350
of the boxes opened by everyone,

126
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,760
we can easily confirm who the mole is.

127
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,590
Lingling...

128
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,590
Shut up!

129
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,390
We've been here for three days.

130
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,790
The number of the boxes that each of us has opened

131
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,320
must be smaller than three.

132
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,280
In fact, excluding the first day,

133
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,220
and the special occasions where we used props,

134
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,260
the total number of the boxes each person

135
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,270
has opened should be one or two.

136
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,460
Since the mole is colluding with the Box Demon,

137
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,790
he'd try to open as many boxes as possible.

138
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,030
Now only Sun Yuanzhou can distinguish the labels.

139
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,030
I bet the mole doesn't know the particularity of the right labels.

140
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,030
This person would open as many boxes as he or she can,

141
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,360
and put wrong labels on them to confuse us.

142
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,060
Without Sun Yuanzhou's tricks,

143
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,960
we would've been stuck in a passive position.

144
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,220
A moment later, let's go check the numbers marked on the boxes.

145
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Okay.

146
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,210
Try to pay special attention to the number of 13.

147
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,380
Is it the code of your suspect?

148
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,350
Yes. I've just figured that out.

149
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,750
The mole has given himself or herself away.

150
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,990
Our code is 9, while Sun Yuanzhou's is 18.

151
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,430
We can rule these two out.

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,060
(Opened, the mouth)

153
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,070
(Opened, empty)

154
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,430
(Opened, empty)

155
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,240
(Opened, empty)

156
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,620
(Opened, empty)

157
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,590
18.

158
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,430
Still 18.

159
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
18 again.

160
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,110
Four boxes are marked "18."

161
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Let's go.

162
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,190
Let's go.

163
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,110
18 is the code of Sun Yuanzhou, who is sure not to be our suspect.

164
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,550
Most people have opened only one or two boxes respectively.

165
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,810
Those who have opened most boxes bear the codes of 13 and 17.

166
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,990
17 is Ji's code.

167
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,990
On the first day when things were out of control,

168
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,250
he opened three boxes.

169
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,700
Plus, since he has the stethoscope,

170
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,430
he has managed to open more boxes than the others.

171
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,060
The player whose code is 13 has placed three labels.

172
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,480
Today is the fourth day.

173
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,310
If you do the math, this number does check out.

174
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,630
Three boxes...

175
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,540
This person must be very bold.

176
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,790
If the player whose code is 13

177
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,620
has really opened three boxes in total,

178
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,630
then this person would be allowed to eat every day.

179
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,150
However, the others couldn't eat on the first day.

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,080
So this person must not eat either.

181
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,990
On the second day, only a small number of people could eat.

182
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,750
Most newcomers chose to starve like the day before,

183
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,020
and refused to open boxes.

184
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,380
But one of them, as a newbie, did eat.

185
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,240
Is that person the one you're suspecting?

186
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,900
Yes. It's Tian Guxue.

187
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,110
I've talked to her several times,

188
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,590
and found her very foolish.

189
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,430
What's more, she's not obsessed with cleanliness at all.

190
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,510
Sun,

191
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,700
can I stay in a room alone?

192
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,000
I have a small fetish about cleanliness.

193
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,780
Won't you be afraid if you stay alone?

194
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,510
I will. So I'm not gonna sleep.

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,540
I must clean up my room tonight.

196
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,790
She wiped the dirt off the torso with her hands without hesitation.

197
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,260
Sun, do you think we'll be able to leave this place?

198
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,470
Are you talking about the girl who told you

199
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,150
to put the key back to the safe?

200
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Yes.

201
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,150
The Box Demon

202
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,700
wouldn't choose to work with experienced players,

203
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,500
because they tend to form teams.

204
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,820
By the time those players take the 10th door challenge,

205
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,590
they would have become bosom friends.

206
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,420
So if the Box Demon works with them, her plan could be ruined.

207
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,310
That's why she would opt for a vulnerable and gutless new player.

208
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,110
I bet she must have promised Tian Guxue something.

209
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,060
For example, she might promise to help Tian become the only survivor.

210
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,520
In return, Tian would give her information.

211
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,590
However, the player she has chosen

212
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,220
is far from being competent.

213
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,710
Otherwise, we wouldn't have seen through her scheme so quickly.

214
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,910
Next, shall we

215
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,430
reopen the box that Tian has opened?

216
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,990
Actually, I think

217
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,310
we should check out her room,

218
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,590
and see if there are other clues.

219
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,560
She stays alone in a room, doesn't she?

220
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,750
Yes.

221
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,550
She claimed to be obsessed with cleanliness, right?

222
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,340
She insisted on having a room to herself.

223
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,240
I guess she hasn't realized that this clever trick of hers would backfire on her.

224
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,580
In such a scary door challenge,

225
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,470
it's unusual for a newbie to stay in a room alone.

226
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,440
It's a good thing. It helps us make judgments.

227
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,260
What if we run into her?

228
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,590
Then we'll distract her.

229
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,910
Okay. I'll do it.

230
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,660
Yixie, take him with you.

231
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,620
You said she's not very intelligent, didn't you?

232
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,620
I can handle her.

233
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,050
I'm afraid you've been mistaken.

234
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,980
The Box Demon wouldn't choose the least intelligent person.

235
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,660
Why didn't the Box Demon just choose me?

236
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,300
That could've made things easier, right?

237
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,230
I can kill all of you effortlessly.

238
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,590
Let's go.

239
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,190
Be careful.

240
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,590
Hello, Tian Guxue.

241
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,580
Can we talk?

242
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,540
Me? What is it?

243
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,910
It's open.

244
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,070
The boxes in this room are covered with fingerprints.

245
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,350
It means that she has opened all of them.

246
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,350
She definitely wouldn't dare to open boxes elsewhere

247
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,780
because she was afraid of attracting attention.

248
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,180
Let's search carefully.

249
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,270
You can go to Sun Yuanzhou.

250
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,990
It was Sun Yuanzhou who told me to ask you.

251
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,020
He and Zhu Meng had a discussion about our two teams working together,

252
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,220
mixing us into pairs.

253
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,550
Would you be willing to be my partner?

254
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,310
Yes.

255
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,080
I hope she didn't unpack any critical skills.

256
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,270
Otherwise, things could get messy.

257
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,480
Zhu Meng, she has unpacked the right foot.

258
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,970
Unpacking the right foot of the Box Demon but hiding it?

259
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,990
Interesting.

260
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,380
She has unpacked the right foot of the Box Demon.

261
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,310
It means the Box Demon can move now.

262
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
What should we do?

263
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,390
Tian Guxue is a double-edged sword.

264
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,270
She can help the Box Demon open boxes,

265
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,530
and she can help us too.

266
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,160
You want her to help us open the boxes?

267
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,670
Aren't you afraid she'll play tricks on us?

268
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,860
Give it a try. Luck is also part of strength.

269
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,140
Have you seen the manual?

270
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,390
No.

271
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,750
The manual should be on her

272
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,970
or may have been destroyed by her.

273
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,310
Alright, let's gather everyone in the square first.

274
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,740
It's time to ask her face to face.

275
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,190
Okay.

276
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,010
(A foot. Note: The foot can move freely between boxes)

277
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,070
This is what we found in the informant's room.

278
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,310
Who is it?

279
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,630
Who is it exactly?

280
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
It's you?

281
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,350
I'm sorry.

282
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,790
I'm sorry, Sun.

283
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,950
I didn't mean it.

284
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,910
She forced me. I didn't want to do it.

285
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,350
Sun, I'm sorry.

286
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,670
Does that help?

287
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,960
I guess you haven't managed your people well either.

288
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,910
I'm sorry, Sun. I did mean it.

289
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,430
I don't know how to tell you.

290
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,750
Sun, please trust me.

291
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
I really didn't expect it.

292
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,109
Sun, trust me.

293
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,510
I really want to tell you,

294
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,390
but I don't know how to say it.

295
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,670
Shut up.

296
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,589
What's the point of apologizing now?

297
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,150
Tell us, how many things have you hidden?

298
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,510
Ji, don't be so loud.

299
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,170
Sun Yuanzhou will handle it well.

300
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,800
He will give us a satisfactory answer.

301
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,830
Tell me, what else have you hidden?

302
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,990
Nothing else, Sun.

303
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,740
I only have this one thing.

304
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,790
Please believe me, there's really nothing else.

305
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,710
Since there's nothing else hidden,

306
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,190
do you mind if we frisk you?

307
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,190
Let go of me!

308
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,310
Let go of me!

309
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,550
Let go of me!

310
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,830
This is illegal!

311
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,950
By what authority are you frisking me?

312
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,480
Looks like you really have something hidden.

313
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,270
I'm so disappointed!

314
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,940
Trust me. There's really nothing else.

315
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,980
Then let me frisk.

316
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,670
If I can't find anything, I'll apologize to you.

317
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Zhu Meng,

318
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,910
you do it.

319
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,120
Let's have a girl do it.

320
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Sure.

321
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,240
If you really don't have another way,

322
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,250
then reluctantly, I'll do it.

323
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,430
Sun, don't worry.

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,760
I won't make fun of you.

325
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,070
If it's okay with you,

326
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
I'll do it.

327
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,910
No!

328
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,660
Let go of me!

329
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,400
(Coffin nail. Note: The coffin nail can kill the Box Demon)

330
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,940
Give it back!

331
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,430
Give it back! It's mine!

332
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,500
Shut up!

333
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
What is this?

334
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,590
The coffin nail.

335
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,340
Give it back.

336
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,200
This is the coffin nail.

337
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,660
As the name suggests,

338
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,350
when we confirm the Box Demon is inside a box,

339
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,340
we can directly nail the coffin shut with this nail,

340
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
and she will die.

341
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,080
It can be considered

342
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,780
the most useful prop.

343
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,680
Fortunately, we discovered her.

344
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,630
otherwise, we wouldn't even know how we would die.

345
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,680
Now that we have the coffin nail

346
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,110
and the location of the Box Demon,

347
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,110
can we...

348
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,150
Today's boxes have all been opened.

349
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,110
We can only wait until tomorrow.

350
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,960
She must have hidden other things,

351
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,500
at least the manual.

352
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
There's more?

353
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,110
I know I was wrong.

354
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,070
But I really didn't mean it.

355
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,990
I'm just scared.

356
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,470
I'm really scared.

357
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,950
We are all human.

358
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,200
Aren't they scared too?

359
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,390
Just because you're scared,

360
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,800
does that mean others can die for you?

361
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,800
If you still have a conscience,

362
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,950
tell me where the manual is.

363
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,950
It's in the water tank in the farthest inside

364
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,420
of the restroom on the first floor.

365
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,550
The water tank?

366
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,750
There really is.

367
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,570
(Manual. Note: All the instructions for the Box Demon game)

368
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,890
It's just like how we played outside.

369
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,950
Let's go.

370
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,710
Sun Yuanzhou, what kind of people did you bring in?

371
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,620
If we had known the rules of the game earlier,

372
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,550
we wouldn't be in such a passive situation now.

373
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,550
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,620
I didn't mean it.

375
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,590
What's the use of apologizing now?

376
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,310
I could kill you and then apologize.

377
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,570
Would you accept that?

378
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,860
Why didn't you destroy the manual?

379
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,390
Because I was very scared. I didn't know.

380
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,470
I was afraid I would forget the instructions.

381
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,460
I don't completely trust the Box Demon.

382
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,500
Otherwise,

383
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,390
I wouldn't carry the coffin nail with me.

384
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,510
Do you have anything else on you?

385
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,100
No. Nothing else.

386
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,600
How many boxes can you open in a day?

387
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,430
Three.

388
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,950
So far, I've only opened 12 of them.

389
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,740
Only 12 of them?

390
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,310
Gosh.

391
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,010
At this rate, you'll be able to open all the boxes in a few more days.

392
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,610
What are you thinking?

393
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,910
I'm thinking about

394
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
how to make the most of it.

395
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,100
Do you really want her to help us open the boxes?

396
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,430
Isn't it too risky?

397
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,060
It is.

398
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,020
But judging by how scared she looks,

399
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,910
my guess was correct.

400
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,070
So, what should we do with her now?

401
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,750
Is it safe to leave her here?

402
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,140
Or should we lock her up?

403
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,110
You know the locations of the Box Demon

404
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,940
and Box Slaves, right?

405
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,750
I don't know. I really don't know.

406
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,140
You don't know?

407
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,660
If you don't know the specific locations of the Box Slave and the Box Demon,

408
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,870
how do you open the boxes?

409
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,130
Aren't you afraid of releasing them all?

410
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,750
When I open a box,

411
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,590
if there's a Box Slave or the Box Demon inside,

412
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,250
they would make sounds.

413
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,070
So the Box Demon cautioned me

414
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,110
that when I open boxes,

415
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,460
I shouldn't have anyone nearby.

416
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,150
That's why I live alone.

417
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,680
Did you open the underground passage?

418
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,230
No, I really didn't.

419
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,190
If you don't believe me,

420
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,820
you can search my room.

421
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,630
I truly didn't.

422
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,400
How many more boxes can you open today?

423
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,380
I've used up my chances for today.

424
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,110
Okay.

425
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,760
We'll verify what you said tomorrow.

426
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,270
If you help us get useful props,

427
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,740
we won't hold you accountable for being an informant.

428
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,940
Where was the manual originally?

429
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,510
It...

430
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,940
It was originally in the lobby.

431
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
The Box Demon suggested I go find it.

432
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,910
Then why didn't I see it before?

433
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,030
I'm the first person here

434
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,910
to hear the Box Demon's cries.

435
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,170
Maybe it was because I arrived earlier than you.

436
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,100
When you came, I had already taken it.

437
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,110
Now, let's discuss

438
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,190
how to deal with this informant.

439
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,550
Are you deaf?

440
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,680
Didn't we just say to let her open the boxes for us?

441
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,190
Just let her go like this?

442
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,140
She won't be killed, but she should be punished, don't you think?

443
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,750
She almost got us all killed.

444
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,590
Don't kill me!

445
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,750
I'm begging you! Please don't kill me!

446
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,670
I'm begging you!

447
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,300
Sis, don't stir up trouble anymore.

448
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,550
Now is not the time for you to muddy the waters.

449
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,810
The most important thing now is to go out.

450
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Lock her up.

451
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,770
It'll be fine if she doesn't open any more boxes.

452
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,160
Let's confine her to her room.

453
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,280
Anyway, the boxes there have all been opened.

454
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,870
Okay. Lock her in her room.

455
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,950
Let's assign people to guard.

456
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,970
Each person takes turns guarding for two hours.

457
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,080
Who wants to do it first?

458
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
I'll do it first.

459
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,630
Okay.

460
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,830
Zhu Meng goes first.

461
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,750
Then, let's arrange the order

462
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,080
and guard according to this sequence.

463
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
Everyone, be careful

464
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,740
and don't let anything go wrong.

465
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
Don't let anything go wrong.

466
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,750
We'll leave her to you guys then.

467
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,310
Bye.

468
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,510
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

469
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,270
I'm thinking about my previous tenth door.

470
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,590
Was it scary?

471
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,150
No.

472
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,990
No. I do wish it could have been scarier.

473
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
What do you mean?

474
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,670
Nothing.

475
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,320
It's just that my friend has died in there.

476
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,410
I feel a little emotional.

477
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,140
As long as we get through today,

478
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,940
tomorrow, Tian Guxue

479
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,540
can help us open three boxes,

480
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,740
and there won't be any risk.

481
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,840
That's a good thing.

482
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,550
Yes.

483
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,430
I'll be with you.

484
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
Me too.

485
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
No need.

486
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,440
It's just two hours.

487
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,070
Go back and take a rest.

488
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,930
Come back to relieve me in 2 hours.

489
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,740
Alright, take care.

490
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
Let's go.

491
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,990
Lingling.

492
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,540
Everything is going according to plan.

493
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
Don't worry.

494
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,510
Although they have the key,

495
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,940
I'm confident

496
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,140
the clue to the next door will be ours.

497
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,910
This could be a lifesaver.

498
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Do you find Zhu Meng a bit strange?

499
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,660
A little bit.

500
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,510
He's even patient with me.

501
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,950
At this point,

502
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,110
he might be a bit tense.

503
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,510
Anyway, the Box Demon can only use the skill once a day.

504
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,710
Her right leg is here.

505
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,950
If she moves,

506
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,150
it means she's launching an attack.

507
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,880
We just need to keep an eye on her right leg.

508
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Okay.

509
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,520
Set an alarm. I'll go to switch shifts ten minutes early.

510
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,950
That's weird.

511
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,300
What's wrong?

512
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,490
I heard the compass ringing. The Box Demon used a skill.

513
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,140
It's just past midnight. Why is she in such a hurry?

514
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,670
Is the right leg still here?

515
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Yes, it's here.

516
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,150
It's here?

517
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
No, wait.

518
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,300
I've encountered the Box Demon before.

519
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,500
She knew her location has been exposed.

520
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,860
So she would use her left leg to move.

521
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
But she left the right leg behind...

522
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,950
It must be either as a backup or to confuse us.

523
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,590
The torso

524
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,950
is the most terrifying part of the Box Demon.

525
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,950
It can kill everyone

526
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,140
in the same room with the Box Demon.

527
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,150
Oh no! She used the torso skill!

528
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,510
Let's go!

529
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Zhu Meng.

530
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Zhu Meng?

531
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:01,990
Zhu Meng!

532
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,110
Lingling, should we crash in?

533
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Stay away from me.

534
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Lingling.

535
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,500
Go back and rest. Don't come in.

536
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,030
What happened?

537
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
I'm fine.

538
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,340
I locked the door in case someone came in.

539
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Go back and rest.

540
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,250
Come back to relieve me later.

541
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,550
I barricaded the door, Yu Lingling.

542
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,550
You can't come in.

543
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,140
It's very important to me.

544
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,520
Can you not hold me back?

545
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,150
Yu Lingling, can't you listen to me just once?

546
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,480
Since you're fine, then open the door.

547
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,590
I told you not to open it!

548
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,720
I told you to open it!

549
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,780
The Box Demon used the torso skill on you,

550
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,910
right?

551
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,900
Zhu Meng, you're lying to me.

552
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,990
It's not that you don't want to come out;

553
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,540
the door simply can't be opened.

554
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,310
I can't get in, can I?

555
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
You're a liar.

556
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,540
You liar!

557
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,550
Liar! Liar!

558
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,230
There's more than one informant.

559
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,280
He told the Box Demon to use the torso skill

560
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,260
to kill everyone in this room.

561
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,430
He did it

562
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,300
to silence Tian Guxue.

563
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,110
More importantly, the key is on you,

564
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,420
so if you're killed, the key will disappear too.

565
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,670
Sometimes,

566
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,070
I wish you weren't so smart.

567
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,750
Because smart people are always in pain.

568
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,260
It's almost time. In a few minutes,

569
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,670
I won't be in pain anymore.

570
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,750
Stop saying that! I want you to come out!

571
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,590
Lingling, goodbye.

572
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,280
I hope you won't be too painful.

573
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,360
Scissors. Where are the scissors?

574
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,430
The scissors.

575
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,590
We rushed out too quickly. The scissors are in the bag.

576
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,790
Wait for me, Zhu Meng.

577
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,680
Why is the door open?

578
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,050
Find the scissors!

579
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,670
Where are the scissors? Where did you put them?

580
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
Pour them out!

581
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,830
Where did you put the scissors?

582
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
The scissors...

583
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,020
I, I lost it.

584
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,590
Cheng Qianli,

585
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,580
I shouldn't have given you the scissors.

586
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,220
Alright.

587
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,590
Go find Sun Yuanzhou. He has a lighter.

588
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,270
I don't want to die yet.

589
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,680
I don't want to die yet. I don't want to die.

590
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,630
You chose to work with the Box Demon.

591
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,460
You should have expected this outcome.

592
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,780
The outcome is already like this.

593
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
Sun Yuanzhou.

594
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,550
Coming.

595
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,670
What's up?

596
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,350
Lighter.

597
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,630
Lend me your lighter.

598
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,020
Zhu Meng is in Tian Guxue's room.

599
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,150
The Box Demon has activated its skill.

600
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,280
The Box Demon has activated its skill?

601
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,230
But aren't there conditions for using the lighter?

602
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,230
Don't mind that.

603
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,429
Give it to me now.

604
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,909
If Zhu Meng died, the key would be gone.

605
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,010
Give it to me first.

606
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,909
Thank you.

607
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,460
Yu Lingling.

608
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,030
Does this mean there's another

609
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,870
informant among us?

610
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,550
There must be.

611
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,750
Otherwise, how did I lose the scissors?

612
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,420
You lost the scissors?

613
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,120
No time to explain. Thank you.

614
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,699
Zhu Meng. Zhu Meng.

615
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,380
I found the lighter, Zhu Meng.

616
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,909
Lighter.

617
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,860
Lingling, how do we get it in?

618
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,150
No, it can't get in.

619
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
It can't get in.

620
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
What should we do?

621
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,070
What should we do?

622
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,640
Zhu Meng.

623
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,630
You're so smart. Think of something, Zhu Meng.

624
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,300
It can't get in, Zhu Meng.

625
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,510
This is a dead end.

626
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,900
What?

627
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,830
This is a dead end.

628
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,720
Did you lose the scissors?

629
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,830
I was careless.

630
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,300
Lingling, come closer.

631
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,390
I have something to tell you.

632
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,750
The key is not with me,

633
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,130
it's under the head of the bed.

634
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Remember to take it with you.

635
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Also,

636
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,190
you must get out alive.

637
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,440
I want you to be safe and happy forever.

638
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,110
No.

639
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,900
I want us to live together.

640
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,870
I want us to live.

641
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,510
I want us to get out together.

642
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,950
Zhu, Zhu Meng.

643
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,830
Zhu Meng.

644
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,060
Zhu Meng.

645
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,830
I will get you out, Zhu Meng.

646
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,470
I will get you out.

647
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
I will get you out.

648
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,670
Lingling. Lingling.

649
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,830
You can't open it, Lingling.

650
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,230
Don't open it, Lingling.

651
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,500
Go away!

652
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,740
Lingling, calm down.

653
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,420
Go away!

654
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,200
Yu Lingling.

655
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
You can't open it.

656
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,740
Where is the comb?

657
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,150
Yu Lingling, listen to me!

658
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,750
Yu Lingling!

659
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,900
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,750
I can't save you.

661
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,460
I'm too weak.

662
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,950
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,420
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
Lingling,

666
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,250
there's still an informant inside the door.

667
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,120
Take care of yourself.

668
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,950
I don't care.

669
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,870
I just want you to live.

670
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,350
Don't worry about me.

671
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,610
I just want you to live.

672
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,390
Have you ever thought

673
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,430
that maybe none of this is real?

674
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,850
So my death

675
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,200
isn't real either.

676
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,270
Will you feel better

677
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,820
if you think this way?

678
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,380
I just want you to live.

679
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
I just...

680
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,580
I just want you to live.

681
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,070
Lingling,

682
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,400
I'll leave the Obsidian to you.

683
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,670
Without you,

684
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,830
what's the point of Obsidian?

685
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,870
It's your responsibility.

686
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,310
Lingling.

687
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,710
Take care.

688
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,390
Zhu Meng.

689
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,710
Zhu, Zhu Meng.

690
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,270
Zhu Meng.

691
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,230
Zhu Meng!

692
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,470
Zhu Meng!

693
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,630
Answer me, Zhu Meng!

694
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,990
Zhu Meng!

695
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,030
Lingling, calm down.

696
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,230
Move!

697
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,470
Zhu Meng!

698
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,590
Answer me, Zhu Meng.

699
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,780
Zhu Meng!

700
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,150
Zhu Meng!

701
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,460
Are you okay, Yu Lingling?

702
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:06,270
The key from the safe

703
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,440
is still on him, right?

704
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,540
If the Box Demon takes that prop,

705
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,390
we'll be in a passive situation.

706
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,350
Did he give you the key?

707
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
Get lost.

708
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,700
Did he give you the key?

709
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
Get lost!

710
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,870
Forget it.

711
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
Let's go.

712
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,470
It's over.

713
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,990
The key is gone.

714
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,150
Fool.

715
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Let's go.
