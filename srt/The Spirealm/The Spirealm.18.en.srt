00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:27,430
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,970
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,910
Wow.

4
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,950
I can finally sleep in a bed.

5
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,630
Zhu Meng.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,110
I was just passing by.

8
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,509
Hello, my name is Xue Zhiyun,

9
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,550
and this is my third time entering the door.

10
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,550
Hello.

11
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,130
If you have any clues, feel free to share.

12
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,590
What... What is this?

13
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,460
It's a fingernail.

14
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,670
Just clean it up.

15
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,910
It seems the mental condition of patients here is not optimistic.

16
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,230
Do we really have to stay here for seven days?

17
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,350
It's about time.

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,590
Let's have meals first.

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,870
Some of what the NPC said

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,990
is still worth listening to.

21
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,990
Let's go.

22
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,910
This is basically a large mental hospital.

23
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,830
Otherwise, how could 8000 people die here?

24
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,710
On the surface, America

25
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,430
advocates human rights and freedom,

26
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,720
but in reality, it sacrifices lives recklessly.

27
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,670
Anyway,

28
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,590
who doesn't have a few quirks or issues?

29
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,910
I... I mean, everyone has quirks or issues,

30
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,230
including me.

31
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,000
Everyone has an unknown side,

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,630
half hidden in the sunlight

33
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,630
and half exposed in the darkness.

34
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,190
Your words

35
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,510
reminded me

36
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,790
of a quote from the psychologist Fromm.

37
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,510
He said that

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,030
the contemporary society

39
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,140
is unhealthy and pathological,

40
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,150
and most people in life are pathological individuals.

41
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,470
They are overly selfish and lose themselves.

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,510
Lingling, you really knew a lot,

43
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,630
but I didn't understand a word.

44
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,670
Let's eat quickly later.

45
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,550
Mental states are contagious.

46
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,310
He's so annoying.

47
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,440
Indeed, very annoying.

48
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,030
Zhu Meng.

49
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm hungry.

50
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,630
Let's go.

51
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,149
Let's check out the other floors after eating.

52
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,149
Okay.

53
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,550
Is this really a hospital?

54
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,960
Why are there so many strange paintings?

55
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,510
Nearly a million people died in the pandemic,

56
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,110
and here, in America, which claims to have the best medical resources in the world.

57
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,520
Someone is eating here.

58
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,430
Did they say eating outside is not allowed?

59
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,950
I brought food too.

60
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,750
Is this allowed?

61
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,790
This is the consequence of eating outside.

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,470
Let's go back first.

63
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,830
Who lives here?

64
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,270
It's Mengmeng. She lives alone.

65
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,270
Mengmeng?

66
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,830
Aren't we staying on the fourth floor?

67
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,750
Why is she in Room 502?

68
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,590
Room 502?

69
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,230
Do you remember what the clue said?

70
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,430
There were a total of 8000 patients who died

71
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,830
at Waverly Hill Sanatorium.

72
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,130
But there was only one nurse who died,

73
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,680
and it was a suicide in Room 502.

74
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,310
So,

75
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Room 502 is the taboo condition here.

76
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,380
Right.

77
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,510
I was relieved that we were not staying on the fifth floor,

78
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,190
but now, when I came back, it had become the fifth floor again.

79
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,190
This place is

80
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,320
It has been changed.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,270
Isn't that harmful?

82
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,270
It's not easy to change, right?

83
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,870
People have to check the doorplate when coming in and out.

84
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,800
Maybe it was changed after someone entered the room.

85
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,990
Then it was done with intent.

86
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,670
Who could have done this?

87
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:46,909
What do you want?

88
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,350
Something was wrong with your doorplate.

89
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,230
How could this happen?

90
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,430
I'm not sure.

91
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,470
But we

92
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,530
suggest you change another room.

93
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,030
The empty rooms here are quite abundant,

94
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,490
and there will be even more

95
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,470
as the number of people decreases.

96
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,110
Thank you for your reminding.

97
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,570
I'll change another room.

98
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,870
It's nothing.

99
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,310
I'm going now.

100
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,510
Wow.

101
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,730
There's nothing here.

102
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,070
Ah, what is this?

103
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,630
Why are you looking at me?

104
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm just admiring your looks.

105
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,960
Lingling, was she serious?

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,820
(Psychiatric Hospital)

107
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,430
Go to sleep.

108
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,430
What's wrong?

109
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,290
Aren't you not used to sleeping on the floor?

110
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,010
I'll go to sleep first.

111
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,890
Aren't you going to sleep?

112
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
What's going on?

113
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,159
It came from the window.

114
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,830
What did you see?

115
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,390
There's nothing.

116
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,410
It sounded like the noise of a heavy object falling.

117
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,490
(Psychiatric Hospital)

118
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,350
So, that red high-heeled shoe belongs to her.

119
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,470
So scary.

120
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,390
It's really like seeing a ghost.

121
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,310
Should we run?

122
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,670
No, let's assess the situation first.

123
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,150
She's coming.

124
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,550
What's going on?

125
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,790
I heard that people who commit suicide

126
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,790
keep experiencing the same scenes.

127
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,430
The nurse

128
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,230
jumped from the room where Mengmeng used to stay.

129
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,760
She thought it was Room 502.

130
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,550
Could it be that the room with the doorplate labeled 502

131
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,680
is not Real Room 502?

132
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,770
Fortunately, we reminded Mengmeng to move out.

133
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,990
We've done our best for Xiong Qi.

134
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,350
She seems addicted to jumping off the building all night.

135
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,370
It's considered a serious disturbance.

136
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,190
It's time for breakfast.

137
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,870
Let's go and have breakfast.

138
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,950
Why is that girl still alone?

139
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,940
She seems to be called Hu Die.

140
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,470
Or she's used to being alone.

141
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,830
Good morning.

142
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,490
Did you sleep well last night?

143
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
Not really.

144
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,870
Did you hear that sound?

145
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,190
Of course we did.

146
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,390
Did you all listen to it all night?

147
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,110
No.

148
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,350
I got tired of listening and fell asleep.

149
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,790
What about you? Did you all go to sleep?

150
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,040
Yes, otherwise what were we doing?

151
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,850
Does the food suit your taste?

152
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,390
Not really, to be honest.

153
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,270
If you feel hungry,

154
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,270
you can eat some of this.

155
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,990
They're biscuits. They look tasty.

156
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,310
We'll try them later.

157
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,090
I'll go have my meal first.

158
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,870
You guys eat.

159
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,310
I won't eat.

160
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,360
I want to keep my eyes.

161
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,270
Are you angry?

162
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,300
This method was disgusting.

163
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,710
The nurse clearly said

164
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,170
we can't eat outside food.

165
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,390
Was he doing this on purpose?

166
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,470
He has been targeting us for a long time.

167
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,790
No wonder Jiang Yingrui started chatting with me

168
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,830
as soon as I arrived,

169
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,990
as if

170
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,400
he had targeted me in the crowd.

171
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,270
It seems

172
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,510
he did some research before entering the door.

173
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,860
Perhaps the disappearance of that Russian guy

174
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,120
is also because of him.

175
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,320
But the Russian guy told me that

176
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,350
we need to find the tun...

177
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,010
We need to find the tunnel.

178
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,670
What does the tunnel look like?

179
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,950
Doesn't the tunnel look like this?

180
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,240
What's the keypoint about the tunnel?

181
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,430
This tunnel

182
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,020
was originally used for transporting supplies,

183
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,360
but later it was referred to as the Death Tunnel.

184
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
I think

185
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,230
the place might not only be used for transporting supplies

186
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,150
but also as our way out of here.

187
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,150
Since it's a tunnel,

188
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,750
it should be in a low-lying area.

189
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,150
Why don't we look around the psychiatric hospital

190
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,630
or maybe in the basement?

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,190
This isn't the normal world.

192
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,730
There are no buildings that must adhere to standard norms.

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,270
Should we

194
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,570
go and check the real Room 502?

195
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,630
The nurse wouldn't be there too, right?

196
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,270
I thought it would be a ward or something.

197
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,480
But it looks like an office.

198
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,670
Why did a nurse jump from here?

199
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,830
Pathology?

200
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,770
Can you understand it?

201
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,470
Why is there bloodletting therapy?

202
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,950
Is it copyrighted?

203
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,320
That should be a common misconception
back then.

204
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,830
No wonder that nurse

205
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,350
jumped so many times but she didn't die.

206
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,670
Maybe people mutated

207
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,490
because of the misconception

208
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,430
and inhumane treatment.

209
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,270
Aliens, you know?

210
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,110
Cheng.

211
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,280
It has nothing to do with us.

212
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,510
Why are we here?

213
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,110
Sorry.

214
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,980
I'll search for the clues now.

215
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,350
Gosh.

216
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,750
W-What is this?

217
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,310
This doll might belong to the nurse's child.

218
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,310
But the clue shows

219
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,930
that her child is dead.

220
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,750
Why did she put it here?

221
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,290
She lost her child,

222
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,510
so she kept this.

223
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,720
It's a little pathetic.

224
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,630
She didn't even have a chance
to see this world.

225
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,390
The thought of women's liberation

226
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,710
was emerging.

227
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,120
But most people didn't accept it.

228
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,330
Most importantly,

229
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,350
that child was an illegitimate child who was not acknowledged.

230
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,910
It seems that the nurse

231
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,830
met a scumbag back then.

232
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,750
They would get married if she met a good man.

233
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,230
And then she didn't need to get an abortion and lose her child.

234
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,550
It's obvious.

235
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,430
This should be put here just now.

236
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,990
How is that possible?

237
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,109
This room is full of dust.

238
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,550
This doll is shabby,

239
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,680
but it's very clean.

240
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,990
It looks like someone put it here carefully.

241
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,990
Zhu Meng.

242
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,590
I-It's crying.

243
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,630
Go.

244
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,390
Ah.

245
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,750
Is that doll

246
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,110
related to the key?

247
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,240
I'm not sure.

248
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,630
But I'm sure

249
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,570
it's related to the red heels.

250
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,480
Let's go back first.

251
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,790
Let's leave.

252
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,670
Open it for me.

253
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,950
What do you want to do?

254
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,310
She was lucky last night.

255
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,210
We can't let her escape this time.

256
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,480
Jiang Yingrui, what are you doing?

257
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,750
What's with the attitude?

258
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,350
Our units are connected.

259
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,310
You and Xia are way out of my league.

260
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,430
Give me my bag.

261
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,310
Give it back!

262
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,510
I don't like you outside.

263
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,110
I hate you even more inside.

264
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,830
Let's go. Hurry up.

265
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,190
Don't be afraid.

266
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,990
Everything is under my control.

267
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,270
Now I almost know

268
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,310
the clue to the key.

269
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,800
Jiang Yingrui gave us cookies.

270
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,290
I think he was up to no good.

271
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,790
I think I know

272
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,390
who they work for.

273
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,670
Shush.

274
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,270
It's you again.

275
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,580
What do you want?

276
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,070
N-Nothing.

277
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,150
I just want to say hello.

278
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:54,910
Oh.

279
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,190
Really?

280
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,640
What are you holding?

281
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,350
Xue Zhiyun, right?

282
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,870
I remember you.

283
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,630
No.

284
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,490
I remember you and your partners.

285
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Sorry.

286
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,470
I suggest you

287
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,990
sleep in separate rooms.

288
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,750
And you'd better have some more rooms.

289
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,100
After all, no one knows

290
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,150
when will this door plate be hung

291
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,640
in front of your room?

292
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,790
Looks like Jiang Yingrui instigated her.

293
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,630
Looks like they're really going to kill us.

294
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,950
Some people have never lived in a mental hospital,

295
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,550
but they're really psychos.

296
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,720
This plate...

297
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,230
Should we keep it here?

298
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
This door plate

299
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,950
will attract something.

300
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,700
Although it's not hung on the door,

301
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
it's not safe.

302
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,110
What should we do?

303
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,360
It's almost eight o'clock.

304
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,910
Stay still.

305
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,430
Where are you going?

306
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,510
Wow.

307
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,370
The space and time in this room are independent.

308
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,240
(The World of the Spi Realm)

309
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,950
What's wrong?

310
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,030
Nothing.

311
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,670
Let's go.

312
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,430
Did you throw it away?

313
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,710
No, I left it in the opposite room.

314
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,190
I'll get it when we need it.

315
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,710
If it weren't for Lingling's sharp hearing,

316
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,670
we would have

317
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,270
died here today.

318
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,430
What's wrong?

319
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,110
You've adapted to the world in the door,

320
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,440
but not to the humanity?

321
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,630
No.

322
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,390
What's wrong with the Spi Realm?

323
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,110
What do you mean?

324
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,930
Why are you asking me this?

325
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,950
I always feel

326
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,440
it has something to do with me.

327
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,990
Fortunately, we left the door plate opposite.

328
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,750
Thanks to Zhu Meng.

329
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,430
You're welcome.

330
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,110
You fell asleep last night?

331
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,520
That thing jumped off the building all night.

332
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,350
I couldn't sleep at all.

333
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,430
It's good to be alive.

334
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,690
Don't ask for too much.

335
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,620
Let's go for breakfast.

336
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,520
I thought about it all night.

337
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,070
I finally understand

338
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,310
what's going on with the door plate.

339
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,950
What's going on?

340
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,990
The sound of jumping last night

341
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,230
was from the opposite room.

342
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,430
The clue shows

343
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,230
the female nurse jumped off a building

344
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,230
in room 502.

345
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,950
So I guess

346
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,320
because we changed the door plate,

347
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,190
the nurse thought it was room 502

348
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,440
and then committed suicide.

349
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,010
As for what happened before jumping,

350
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,400
it was definitely not a good thing.

351
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,710
You seem smarter.

352
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,880
I've been thinking about it all night.

353
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,230
After I go out,

354
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,150
I can act in a suspense movie.

355
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,350
Just eat.

356
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,560
Why isn't Meng here?

357
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,750
She's always alone.

358
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,090
Who knows where she is?

359
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,150
She might have found the key and left here.

360
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,710
Good morning.

361
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,950
Shame on them.

362
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,790
Didn't you notice that some people were missing

363
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,310
in this psychiatric hospital?

364
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,310
Who?

365
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,910
There are nurses and patients.

366
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,670
But there are no doctors.

367
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,730
It seems that I didn't see any doctor.

368
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,540
I just saw a few nurses.

369
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,830
The NPC said

370
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,190
we need to wait for the doctors.

371
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,550
Does that mean

372
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,080
we need to find the doctors?

373
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,390
The 6th floor is the only place we haven't visited.

374
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,720
Let's go.

375
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,030
Go.

376
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,180
(Dean's Office)

377
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,690
There's one picture missing.

378
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,150
This place is

379
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,270
for whom?

380
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,830
Could this be the female nurse?

381
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,820
It says she's deceased.

382
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,350
(Psychiatric Hospital)

383
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,990
This nurse has been excellent

384
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,520
from the nursing school to this hospital.

385
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,150
What a pity.

386
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,350
This should be the dean.

387
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,870
He's quite handsome.

388
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,170
His picture is not on the wall.

389
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,910
So,

390
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,310
is he the scumbag you mentioned?

391
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,310
Is the place in the middle

392
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,790
for him?

393
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,620
The key might be behind it.

394
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,790
This is an empty frame.

395
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,430
Nothing special.

396
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,160
They are coming to life.

397
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,910
Zhu Meng.

398
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,750
Do you think the clues to the key

399
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,280
related to the empty frame?

400
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,550
I checked.

401
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,550
There's nothing.

402
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,750
To be precise,

403
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,310
the clues should be related to the missing picture.

404
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,440
Where are we going to find the picture?

405
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,530
This psychiatric hospital is so big.

406
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,350
This is...

407
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,910
Russian doll?

408
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,030
It's empty.

409
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,750
Do you have any clues?

410
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,990
This is the nurse's love letter

411
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,350
to the dean.

412
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,270
Did the nurse write this?

413
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,310
She was still asking to get back together.

414
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,630
That scumbag cheated on her.

415
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,430
Why did she treat him like this?

416
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,070
The world can turn without anyone.

417
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,070
Am I right?

418
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:52,230
The nurse's death must have something
to do with the dean.

419
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,090
Let's go and look for other clues.

420
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,550
(Mortuary)

421
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,550
Mortuary.

422
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,030
There's something here.

423
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,110
What are these?

424
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Corpses.

425
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,830
So many corpses.

426
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,510
Don't they handle them?

427
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
What did you say?

428
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,350
I mean

429
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,950
don't they

430
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,630
deal with these bodies?

431
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,030
This room

432
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,790
has a rotten smell.

433
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,530
This might be a breakthrough.

434
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,710
If they want to deal with these bodies,

435
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,910
they'll use a tunnel.

436
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,750
Right.

437
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,320
We just need to follow them.

438
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,350
Well,

439
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,020
we don't know

440
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,270
when they will deal with the bodies.

441
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,290
The lock here has been broken.

442
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,730
It means someone has arrived here early.

443
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,420
If they were smart enough,

444
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,470
they might have found this clue.

445
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,170
I hope it's not Jiang Yingrui.

446
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,670
We're close.

447
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,450
Let's look for more clues.

448
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,270
Cheng.

449
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,630
Wait outside.

450
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,680
Tell us if you're in danger.

451
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,950
We're inside.

452
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,030
Okay.

453
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,680
Don't worry.

454
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,790
I'm good at it.

455
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,510
Eh?

456
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,950
Gorgeous,

457
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,110
why are you here alone?

458
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,270
Anything wrong?

459
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,550
Can't I be here alone?

460
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,860
Where are your friends?

461
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,260
Why aren't they with you?

462
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,690
Leaving you here alone

463
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,199
might get you in danger.

464
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,100
I don't feel like talking to you.

465
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,030
Why do you have to reject me?

466
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,850
The more helpers you have, the more likely you'll survive.

467
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,409
What are you doing?

468
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,670
As you can see,

469
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,429
that room's full of dead bodies.

470
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,949
Listen,

471
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,909
if I put you

472
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
in a bag now,

473
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,590
and toss you in that room,

474
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,840
do you think they'll notice it?

475
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,989
You...

476
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,469
I was just kidding. How could I do that?

477
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,750
You look so cute.

478
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,429
I would hate to do something so terrible to you.

479
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,870
You came down here from the sixth floor, right?

480
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,330
Have you got any findings?

481
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,070
W-Why would I tell you anything?

482
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,550
Don't you remember what I just said?

483
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,110
Making a new friend can bring you new hopes.

484
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,770
Why do you have to put all your eggs in one basket?

485
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,590
Maybe those friends of yours

486
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,850
will even have trouble protecting themselves.

487
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,150
Why don't you team up with me instead?

488
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,510
Why did you do that?

489
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,790
Bah!

490
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,470
You human scum!

491
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,990
Human scum is what I detest most!

492
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,790
You don't think I'll hit a woman?

493
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,810
What are you trying to do, human scum?

494
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,910
She kicked me first!

495
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,110
So what?

496
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,070
This isn't over!

497
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,060
Zaozao,

498
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,910
please don't cry.

499
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,630
Well...

500
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,910
It's our fault.

501
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,030
We shouldn't have left you here.

502
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,230
Drama queen,

503
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,350
have you had your fun?

504
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,990
Great!

505
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,450
I'm feeling great!

506
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,920
How was your inquiry going?

507
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,310
Those dead bodies don't seem to be NPCs.

508
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,350
They didn't interact with us.

509
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,350
Are we gonna

510
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,830
stay in the mortuary?

511
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,830
Players aren't supposed to

512
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,490
go out after 8 at night, right?

513
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,960
That nurse told us to try not to

514
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,110
go out after 8.

515
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,190
It's not a ban.

516
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,510
How about this?

517
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,660
Tomorrow we'll come to the mortuary again.

518
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,870
If all or some of the bodies inside

519
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,040
have been moved away by then,

520
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,910
it can prove that the people here remove dead bodies at night.

521
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,630
It also means

522
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,290
we can leave our room at night.

523
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,910
Yeah.

524
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,510
Zhu, you're amazing.

525
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,950
Lingling, you're also amazing.

526
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,410
You do have an unquenchable thirst for life.

527
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,390
I've slept on the floor before.

528
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,120
Now this is just a piece of cake!

529
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,310
But what if the number of the bodies stays the same?

530
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,750
Then we'll have to think of a new way to find the tunnel.

531
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,750
7 days

532
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,350
can pass quickly.

533
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,110
I hope it won't take us too much time

534
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,600
to find the tunnel.

535
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,870
If Jiang Yingrui finds it first,

536
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,510
I'm afraid

537
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,790
we won't be able to leave this hospital.

538
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,350
Then what are we waiting for?

539
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,550
We must seize the day!

540
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,950
There aren't any doctors.

541
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,550
The patients aren't of help.

542
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,230
Shall we ask the nurses here?

543
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,910
Hello.

544
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,670
We're wondering...

545
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,930
I don't know anything.

546
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,990
Why did you rush to deny knowing anything

547
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,920
before we could ask you a question?

548
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,550
Why are you running away?

549
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,550
Does it mean

550
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,230
you already knew what our question was?

551
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,530
She's looking for him.

552
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,750
What do you mean?

553
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,890
She's looking for him.

554
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,600
He destroyed the romance they had,

555
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,430
abandoned her,

556
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,310
and caused her death.

557
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,830
What does that mean?

558
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,870
Then, where is he now?

559
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,110
I don't know.

560
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,790
No one knows.

561
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
However,

562
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,570
he is in this hospital.

563
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,190
What's that supposed to mean?

564
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,760
I was just praising you for your brilliance a moment ago.

565
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,350
I got it!

566
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,510
That scumbag

567
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,390
killed the nurse and her baby.

568
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,840
So the ghost of the nurse who jumped off the building

569
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,590
plans to take revenge on that man.

570
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,920
All the doctors in this hospital are dead,

571
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,750
except that scumbag who's still at large,

572
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,310
hiding in an unknown place.

573
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,910
Therefore, the last portrait

574
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,860
should be that scumbag's.

575
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,230
I mean the empty frame we saw in the director's office.

576
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,510
Room 502

577
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,480
should be the doctor's office,

578
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,670
and also where his relationship with the nurse started.

579
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,270
Those red high heels

580
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,770
were a token of affection.

581
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,270
If he's just a doctor,

582
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,270
why would his photo appear

583
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,730
in the director's office?

584
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,950
A man

585
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,310
betrays his woman

586
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,130
either for another woman,

587
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,040
or for fame and fortune.

588
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,670
Are you saying that in order to become the hospital director,

589
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,430
that doctor deserted the nurse,

590
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,960
and killed her and her baby,

591
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,090
like a husband murdering his wife and child?

592
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,800
What a heartless man!

593
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:25,840
Bah!

594
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,590
Scumbag!

595
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,610
He's irredeemably depraved!

596
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,630
This is truly a sad story.

597
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,430
What should we do now?

598
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,170
Knowing stories like this

599
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,440
wouldn't help much.

600
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,310
We should still rest our hopes on the mortuary.
