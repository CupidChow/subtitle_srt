(Episode 4)

3
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,310
Dad!

4
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,950
Mom!

5
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,700
I... I miss you.

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Jiu!

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,670
My girl!

8
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,710
My girl!

9
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,990
Jiu! Jiu!

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,790
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,030
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,830
It's all my fault.

13
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,350
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,270
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,030
I made you suffer.

16
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,350
It's still yours.

17
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,590
Thanks.

18
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,110
Well...

19
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,110
I'm back.

20
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,870
I'm really back.

21
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,870
It's only been 15 minutes.

22
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,870
15 minutes.

23
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,350
15 minutes.

24
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,390
- Door? - I'm back.

25
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,630
Ruan Baijie?

26
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,190
Ling Jiushi,

27
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,240
you stepped on my carpet with your shoes on again!

28
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Well.

29
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,110
Didn't you tell me during the day

30
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,030
that "resignation is nothing!"

31
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,310
Why are you depressed now?

32
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,710
Who are you cosplaying as?

33
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,860
No.

34
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,230
I'm just thinking.

35
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
Wait a minute.

36
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,270
Don't be handsy.

37
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,470
What happened to your neck?

38
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,430
The injury I got in the game is still there

39
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,110
when I'm back in the real world.

40
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,350
What game? What real world?

41
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,030
You found a new game?

42
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,560
No.

43
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
I...

44
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,870
I had a fall.

45
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
No.

46
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,050
It doesn't look like you fell,

47
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,510
nor a hickey.

48
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,830
It looks like rope burns.

49
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:44,909
Not fun.

50
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,114
I got this back to reality too.

51
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,440
(Fitcher's Bird)

52
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,150
Chestnut!

53
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,430
Chestnut. Chestnut!

54
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,640
Why don't you let me hug you?

55
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,830
Hey!

56
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,240
What's on your mind?

57
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
I...

58
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,590
I just quit my job.

59
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,590
I'm happy, okay?

60
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,590
I'm happy.

61
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,110
You're happy.

62
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,190
I'm still a programmer.

63
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,990
Whatever.

64
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,710
Give it back to me.

65
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,710
What?

66
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,230
Take care of your wound.

67
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,790
I'm going to bed.

68
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,630
You're getting more and more kinky.

69
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,100
(Fitcher's Bird)

70
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,070
Ling Jiushi.

71
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,190
Is this the Spi Realm?

72
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
You know it?

73
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,040
(The Spi Realm)

74
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,190
Have a look at it.

75
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,590
Lend me your VR goggles.

76
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
No.

77
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,750
Let me tell you!

78
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,429
This game is very weird.

79
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,270
We can't get in.

80
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,870
I could get in before.

81
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,830
You tell me.

82
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,910
Where did you get this game?

83
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,990
It has not been launched in China.

84
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,590
We are not supposed to get it.

85
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,590
Someone gave it to me.

86
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,270
Someone?

87
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,870
He's up to no good.

88
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,030
This is the Gloomy Sunday in the game.

89
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,270
Gloomy Sunday. Do you know that?

90
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,060
The notorious death song.

91
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,550
People who heard it either went mad

92
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,810
or committed suicide.

93
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,550
You mean that people will die playing this game?

94
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,470
This game was originally called the Spi Realm.

95
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,270
But most of the players

96
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,780
have gone crazy.

97
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,730
Some even committed suicide.

98
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,440
That's why it's called the Spi Realm of Death.

99
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,370
Forbidden long ago overseas.

100
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,110
But recently,

101
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,790
I don't know which bastard he is,

102
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,550
but he can keep posting different versions on the Internet.

103
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,550
By the way,

104
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,950
the prototype of this game

105
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,950
was designed by a Chinese designer.

106
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,150
He wants to create a spiritual world

107
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,150
that realizes the full potential of virtual reality

108
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,590
and enables zero-distance interaction.

109
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,190
So, he named it the Spi Realm.

110
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,030
I know. I know.

111
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,640
What does this have to do with the game?

112
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,850
I'm getting off track.

113
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,030
Anyway, after the Chinese designer

114
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,190
created the game,

115
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,630
the capital sought profit

116
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,230
and intended to monetize it.

117
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,110
The game company in America is unscrupulous

118
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,870
and adds a lot of bloody violence to the game.

119
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,530
So it turned into this horrible thing today.

120
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,750
You don't even bother

121
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
to check the weather forecast.

122
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,990
Now you even know all of these?

123
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,150
Dog Qi.

124
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,550
You want to make a Chinese version of it, right?

125
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,230
Alright.

126
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,430
The company where I'm working part-time wants to do it.

127
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,960
What other choice do I have?

128
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,550
Besides, I didn't think it was as serious as they said.

129
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,990
What "you can't control yourself once you get in the door."

130
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,390
"You can't get rid of it."

131
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,860
We can control our minds.

132
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,870
Right?

133
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,430
What you're playing now

134
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,550
is the first two sample versions of this game.

135
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,510
If I were you, I'd delete it.

136
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,710
All right. That's it.

137
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,630
My girlfriend is waiting for me.

138
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm staying at her place today.

139
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,710
Rest early.

140
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,990
This is your integrity.

141
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,990
Bang!

142
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,670
Go!

143
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,550
Chestnut, stop it.

144
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,440
Chestnut, come here.

145
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,790
Chestnut!

146
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,710
Chestnut.

147
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Ruan Baijie?

148
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,470
I'm Ruan Lanzhu.

149
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,030
The name you're too shy to ask.

150
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,520
How did you get into my room?

151
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,440
This kind of door is easy to open.

152
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,710
Freshen up.

153
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,910
Come out with me.

154
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,970
You can choose not to come.

155
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,710
How did you find me?

156
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,150
I told you.

157
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,880
It's easy to find you since you use your real name.

158
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,990
Get in.

159
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,150
This is your car?

160
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,150
You are that rich?

161
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,310
This is Cheng Qianli.

162
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,610
We'll talk after we're back in Obsidian.

163
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,510
Well...

164
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,390
What is it?

165
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,970
May I ask how old your friend is?

166
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,350
I just turned 18.

167
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,440
Then you must just get your driver's license, right?

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
How about I drive?

169
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,840
Do you know at what age

170
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,870
one can get a racing license?

171
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,710
I don't know.

172
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,770
I've been racing cars for five years.

173
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,030
Sit tight.

174
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Boss.

175
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,350
Ruan, you're back.

176
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Yes.

177
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,920
This is Ling Jiushi.

178
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,750
You explain it to him.

179
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,750
Okay.

180
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,150
Where should I begin?

181
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,430
Everything is new to him.

182
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,990
It's too late.

183
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,440
I'll go through a door first.

184
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,900
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

185
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,640
Drive faster next time.

186
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,830
I'll be speeding if I drive even faster.

187
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,910
15 minutes?

188
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,360
Come on.

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,550
Let me introduce.

190
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,870
Her name is Lu Yanxue.

191
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,600
She's the only girl on our team.

192
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,750
She's bolder than men

193
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,310
but also rougher than men.

194
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,440
Can you speak properly, Cheng Qianli?

195
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,890
That one with glasses is Chen Fei.

196
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,710
His name is Yi Manman.

197
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,370
You can take this sofa.

198
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,670
Don't blame them for being cold.

199
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,150
After all, you know.

200
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,360
If you die inside the door, you'll probably be dead in real life.

201
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,550
So they won't get too attached

202
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,670
to strangers.

203
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,630
You just said 15 minutes.

204
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,230
Do you know why?

205
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,910
Because the time inside the door

206
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,910
is different from the time outside.

207
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,910
Generally, it takes about 15 minutes in reality

208
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,550
to go through a door.

209
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,870
No wonder.

210
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,990
What is this "door"?

211
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,390
It's the Spi Realm.

212
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,960
Once you start playing the game for even a minute,

213
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,670
you will be controlled by it.

214
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,000
Only by passing all 12 doors in the game

215
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,950
can you fully break free from the mental control imposed by the game.

216
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,270
Mental control?

217
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,990
It's like the Gloomy Sunday.

218
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,480
Smart.

219
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,490
Although I don't know what the Gloomy Sunday is,

220
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,410
Ruan said the same thing to me.

221
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,470
Did you open the door?

222
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,840
Did you get the note?

223
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,190
Note?

224
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,230
You mean this?

225
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,200
Here.

226
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,690
(Fitcher's Bird)

227
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,950
Fitcher's Bird.

228
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,430
Why did you encounter this on your second door?

229
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,830
Didn't they all say that newbies are lucky?

230
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,150
I looked into it. It's a fairy tale.

231
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,230
No.

232
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

233
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,190
What's wrong?

234
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,990
Nothing.

235
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,550
When Ruan comes back,

236
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,710
he can help you.

237
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,550
Ruan is the king when it comes to going through the door.

238
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,710
He is our boss.

239
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,310
As long as he's here...

240
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,510
He's your boss, not my boss.

241
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,270
Tell me.

242
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,070
Why are your reactions so strange?

243
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,070
Is it scary?

244
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,470
To put it simply,

245
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,109
it's super scary.

246
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,790
Bro,

247
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,329
I major in science.

248
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,750
I am a staunch materialist.

249
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,569
I'm not afraid. I can understand.

250
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,630
Go ahead.

251
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,190
No.

252
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,430
Even if you can understand,

253
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,950
I can't explain it to you clearly.

254
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,950
It's getting late.

255
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,349
You can go upstairs and rest.

256
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,549
Ruan will explain it to you when he comes back.

257
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,080
Go up the stairs over there.

258
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,750
The first room on the right.

259
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,630
Cheng Qianli.

260
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,120
You changed your style?

261
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,830
I'm his big brother, Cheng Yixie.

262
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,150
Yixie and Qianli.

263
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Interesting.

264
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,870
It's not interesting at all.

265
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,150
I forgot to tell you.

266
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,350
I have a twin brother named Cheng Yixie.

267
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,030
Don't say "Yixie and Qianli"

268
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,390
when you see him.

269
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,990
He doesn't like it and holds grudges.

270
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,470
Thank you for telling me that in time.

271
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,670
That's good.

272
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,590
You can rest here.

273
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,510
Ruan will explain everything to you when he comes back.

274
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,390
Okay.

275
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,070
Thank you.

276
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,070
I'm leaving.

277
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,640
Interesting, twins.

278
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,150
What happened?

279
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,310
Worried about me?

280
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,070
I'm fine.

281
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,590
Why didn't you ask your boys to come?

282
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,470
It's too late.

283
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,270
Forget it. I'll do it.

284
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,830
You're like this when you're inside the door.

285
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,530
You're the only one I have seen

286
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,280
who is the same inside or outside the door.

287
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,870
You mean,

288
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,830
inside and outside of the door, one is in disguise.

289
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,070
And one that's real.

290
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,110
All done.

291
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,790
Thanks.

292
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,990
I'll make it for you.

293
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,990
Wait here.

294
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,830
This is the only food I can cook.

295
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,190
Make do with it.

296
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,910
Your villa is quite grand.

297
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,730
You must have received a lot of membership fees.

298
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,710
There is no money exchange in Obsidian

299
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,070
but only information sharing.

300
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,790
Of course, for outsiders,

301
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,150
we accept the commission

302
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,270
to help the players who didn't pass the first six doors

303
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,870
at the expense of essential props in the doors.

304
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,280
Is this what you said

305
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,600
that you only accept props, not money,

306
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,630
to help the players pass the doors?

307
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,630
Inside the door,

308
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,110
props are more useful than money.

309
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,990
What're the differences of the doors?

310
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,710
There are many differences.

311
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,430
Many players will enter the same door at the same time.

312
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,780
The first man who passes it

313
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,640
will get the clue of the next door.

314
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,190
It's the note you took.

315
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,350
Each door has different scenes and themes

316
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,750
in four categories,

317
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,340
represented by the Four Images,

318
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,790
Blue Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise,

319
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,630
which weigh different difficulties.

320
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,320
Blue Dragon is the lowest-level door,

321
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,270
and then White Tiger,

322
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,810
Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

323
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,350
Fitcher's Bird is Blue Dragon.

324
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,270
That's a low-level door.

325
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,190
Then why did you react so strangely

326
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,390
when you heard it?

327
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,750
Because so far,

328
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,960
no one has been out of this door.

329
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,070
No one was out?

330
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,430
Are they dead?

331
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,550
We have an internal discussion forum,

332
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,870
in which those who passed the doors could share their experience.

333
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,110
But until now,

334
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,510
no one has ever

335
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,530
shared any clues of this door.

336
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,870
Many comments said people who got the clues of the door

337
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,750
never showed up.

338
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,030
Their internet protocol logins don't even exist.

339
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,070
But don't worry.

340
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,670
I'll pass this door with you.

341
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,030
We can pass it together?

342
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,230
Of course,

343
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,520
or how do you think Xiong Qi and Ke knew each other?

344
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,430
Boss.

345
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,870
You two experienced players

346
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,350
didn't get any clues

347
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,030
of a low-level door.

348
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,110
They're Ruan Baijie and Ling Jiushi.

349
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,430
So many players tried to pass the doors.

350
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,710
Do I have to remember all their names?

351
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,870
Wow.

352
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,270
What an embarrassing situation.

353
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,310
I can't bear it.

354
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,550
Don't be sarcastic.

355
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,710
Boss,

356
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,190
Tang Yaoyao's next door is about to open.

357
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,540
She will get the clue.

358
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,110
Tang Yaoyao,

359
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,790
don't let me down.

360
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,790
Boss, be at ease.

361
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,750
At ease?

362
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,110
Only when I get

363
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,110
all information about the Spi Realm

364
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,830
can I be at ease.

365
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,510
Understand?

366
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes.

367
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,920
If we can bring our weapons in

368
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
and kill them all,

369
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,470
we can get the note.

370
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,310
Nonsense.

371
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,840
We can't bring any weapons in except the props from the doors.

372
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,570
Or, I would've brought AK in already.

373
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,390
So,

374
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,430
you want me to join the Obsidian, right?

375
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,670
Yes.

376
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,230
I'm a newbie.

377
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,510
Am I so good?

378
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,630
Not you,

379
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,230
but me.

380
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,510
Because I can see your value.

381
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,750
By the way,

382
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,310
you made the first door disappear.

383
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,630
Disappear?

384
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,870
I've never seen it.

385
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,630
No one

386
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,880
could enter this door anymore.

387
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,770
No wonder we can't enter the first door in the game.

388
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,810
You have one night to consider it.

389
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,440
Give me an answer tomorrow.

390
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,590
I can answer you now.

391
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,430
I refuse.

392
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,630
Give me a reason.

393
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,710
I don't want to enter the doors.

394
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,910
You can refuse me,

395
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,280
but you can't refuse the doors.

396
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,110
Did he leave?

397
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,430
Yes.

398
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,190
It's rare that

399
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,080
a door-breaker rejected Ruan.

400
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,270
Are you going to choose him?

401
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,670
I think Yi Manman is more reliable.

402
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,880
Don't jump to conclusions.

403
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,870
Purifying this game

404
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,790
is a long process.

405
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,070
Yi Manman has passed several doors with us.

406
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,710
He had

407
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,590
a moderate performance.

408
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,790
Isn't it too risky

409
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,910
to put your hopes on a rookie?

410
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,430
After all, no one

411
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,600
has went into the 12th door.

412
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,450
You should be cautious

413
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,350
when choosing a partner.

414
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,830
My intuition tells me

415
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,710
he can make it.

416
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,910
- Sorry. - It's okay.

417
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,790
Wang Xiaoyi!

418
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,390
Wang Xiaoyi!

419
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,110
Zhang Zishuang!

420
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,310
Zhang Zishuang!

421
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,260
Dead. Dead.

422
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,350
Cheng Wen! Cheng Wen!

423
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,710
Cheng Wen!

424
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,670
What's wrong with you?

425
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,270
Be alive, please.

426
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,670
Sir, please cooperate with us.

427
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,390
Cheng Wen. Cheng Wen!

428
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,950
Hurry up!

429
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,830
Jiushi,

430
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,760
how did you get injured?

431
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,040
There was a car accident

432
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,270
on my way back.

433
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,110
You always interfere with other people's business.

434
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,020
What if someone extorts you?

435
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,430
What's more

436
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,550
you can dream of being a hero,

437
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,030
but you're not the saviour of the world.

438
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,110
Hey.

439
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,110
Hey.

440
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,990
Jiushi,

441
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,170
why are you absent-minded today?

442
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,230
What's wrong?

443
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,070
I'm fine.

444
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,210
If you die inside the door, you may also die outside.

445
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,910
Help me.

446
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,500
Jiushi. Jiushi.

447
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,110
Jiushi.

448
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Are you okay?

449
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,510
What's wrong with you today?

450
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,910
Nothing.

451
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,510
I didn't sleep well last night.

452
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,080
I'm going to be late.

453
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
I'm leaving.

454
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,280
Call me if you need any help.

455
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,670
You can refuse me,

456
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,640
but you can't refuse the doors.

457
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,470
Did you see the news?

458
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,350
Cheng Wen, Zhang Zishuang and Wang Xiaoyi died.

459
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,670
I don't need to read the news. This is common sense.

460
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,400
Why? You don't believe my words,

461
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,470
but the news, huh?

462
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Damn it.

463
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,550
What's going on?

464
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,210
Are you hiding something from me?

465
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,870
Could there be a powerful force behind this

466
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,350
to harm us players?

467
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,480
You overthought it.

468
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,230
I also doubted what you are suspecting.

469
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,870
But this is the fate of the game.

470
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,070
If you choose to play,

471
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,400
you have to accept it.

472
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Let's go.

473
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,670
Where am I?

474
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,470
Why am I here?

475
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,470
Who took me here?

476
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,030
I'm going to ask for help.

477
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,910
I will call the police.

478
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,990
Buddy,

479
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,110
I don't want to stay here anymore.

480
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,630
Can you take me out of here?

481
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,100
It's your first time passing the door?

482
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,110
Door?

483
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,870
What door?

484
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,110
I was on the toilet at home.

485
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,170
Then I came here in the blink of an eye.

486
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,469
Leave here now.

487
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,909
Something is wrong with the fog.

488
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,710
Something is wrong with the fog.

489
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,969
It looks like this door

490
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,190
is as scary as they said.

491
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,710
You know that too?

492
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,710
Of course.

493
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,150
This is the second door.

494
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,550
It's easy to get the note.

495
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,510
But as far as I know,

496
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,330
it's not easy to go out.

497
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,360
Where is this place?

498
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,469
Where is this?

499
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,710
Welcome to the world inside the doors.

500
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,710
My name is Zhu Meng.

501
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,710
This is my second time to pass the door.

502
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,179
What about you?

503
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,239
My name is Tian Yan.

504
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,150
This is my second time to pass the door.

505
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,190
Just call me Yan.

506
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,070
My name is Zhong Chengjian.

507
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,480
What is the door?

508
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,510
I don't understand.

509
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,150
My name is Zhang Xinghuo.

510
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,950
My name is

511
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,870
Zeng Ruguo.

512
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,170
It must be your first time.

513
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,710
My name is Ling...

514
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,030
Yu Lingling.

515
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,950
I'm Xu Xiaocheng.

516
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,190
This place is scary.

517
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,110
Can I go out first?

518
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,470
There's no turning back after coming into the door.

519
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,710
But don't worry.

520
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,790
As long as we can find the door and the key,

521
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,180
we can pass the game.

522
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,990
But I heard that

523
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,670
so far,

524
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,270
people who came in have turned into moving dead

525
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,710
in the thick fog behind.

526
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,510
No one can get out alive.

527
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,920
It's a terrible way to comfort others.

528
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,870
I'm just telling the truth.

529
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,230
to prevent others from having unrealistic fantasies,

530
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,090
which will make them die earlier.

531
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,590
Hello.

532
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,510
How about this?

533
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,990
Let's go into the building first,

534
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,990
okay?

535
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Zhu.

536
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,230
How was my acting?

537
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,500
It was as terrible as

538
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,030
your bad movies.

539
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,910
I learned a lot before I came in the door.

540
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,470
Please stop looking at me.

541
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,550
It's too obvious.

542
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,590
Don't be anxious.

543
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,150
Maybe the upstairs is scarier.

544
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,710
If you are in such a hurry,

545
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,830
you may die first.

546
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,830
How about this?

547
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,910
I'll take him upstairs to find out what's going on.

548
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,240
If it's safe, I'll come down to pick you up.

549
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,970
Okay?

550
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,110
Come down quickly please.

551
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,110
I'm scared.

552
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,990
You too.

553
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,990
I'm scared, too.

554
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,170
It looks like we can only go to the 14th floor.

555
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,250
Xu Xiaocheng is my client.

556
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,510
She is an actress

557
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,910
who acted in many movies.

558
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,440
You must have seen her work.

559
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,800
You're a good actor, too. I think you two are a perfect match.

560
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,800
She's not the best actress.

561
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,770
Her acting is not as good as yours.

562
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,750
The magnetic field is chaotic here.
