00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:27,370
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,950
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,870
I thought this door challenge was friendly to the players.

4
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,030
I didn't expect it to be filled with danger.

5
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,670
Door challenges are essentially dangerous.

6
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,590
The 7th challenge and beyond

7
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,080
will be more difficult.

8
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,440
But your performance today

9
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,470
was really good.

10
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,070
I'm sure you'll become highly skillful.

11
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
Lingling,

12
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,430
if you don't know how to pay a proper compliment,

13
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,580
perhaps you shouldn't utter a word at all.

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,580
Alright?

15
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,350
Lingling.

16
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,710
Huh?

17
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,830
What time is it?

18
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,870
7 o'clock.

19
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,240
Where are you going?

20
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,550
Where is he going?

21
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,310
I don't know.

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,550
He...

23
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,190
Is he gonna fight that nurse's ghost alone?

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,170
Are you stupid or what?

25
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,870
I'll go take a look.

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,870
I'm going now.

27
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,710
Where have you been?

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,240
No question. Go to bed.

29
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,470
Okay!

30
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,240
It's healthy to sleep early and wake up early.

31
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,830
Help!

32
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,870
Don't kill me!

33
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,430
I beg you to spare my life!

34
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,630
Please spare my life!

35
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,829
Help!

36
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,510
Help!

37
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,150
Alright?

38
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,030
Xue Zhiyun?

39
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,140
She's coming.

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,090
Hurry up! Close the window!

41
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,230
Let's go!

42
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:00,070
T-That brawny man died inside!

43
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,790
The brawny man died in the room.

44
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,150
Xue Zhiyun's dead body is downstairs.

45
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,370
What about Jiang Yingrui?

46
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,830
Given what happened last night,

47
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,630
he was unlikely to escape, right?

48
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,800
How was it possible...

49
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
What's wrong?

50
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,310
What happened?

51
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,630
Why are you looking at me that way?

52
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,790
D-Didn't you already...

53
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,750
Here's the thing.

54
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,909
I had a fight with them last night,

55
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,350
so I slept in another room.

56
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,650
Is there a problem?

57
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,010
Where's your other teammate?

58
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,760
Why are you asking about him?

59
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,270
I suspect

60
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,310
Xue Zhiyun

61
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,670
was killed by him.

62
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,330
What kind of nonsense is that?

63
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,550
You are the one who's been trying to harm us.

64
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,910
If we hadn't found it out,

65
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,770
we would've been killed long ago.

66
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,160
Anything wrong with it?

67
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,630
Hey!

68
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,170
Are you looking for me?

69
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,950
Never mind.

70
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,990
He spoke calmly to us.

71
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,670
There shouldn't be a problem, right?

72
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,750
That's the biggest problem.

73
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,230
Huh?

74
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,080
Come on. Let's go to eat breakfast.

75
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,590
Time to eat!

76
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,590
What do you think

77
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,260
Jiang Yingrui did to escape from death?

78
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,050
A Door Ghost kills someone

79
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,990
surely because

80
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,160
he or she is in breach of a certain taboo condition.

81
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,150
Even if this person manages to survive the first killing,

82
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,480
the Door Ghost won't stop going after him.

83
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,630
Impressive.

84
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,559
I learned that from you.

85
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,890
You'll get better and better.

86
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,230
Maybe one day

87
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,470
it'll be your turn to protect me.

88
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,830
By the way,

89
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,230
what do you think?

90
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,840
On the issue about the hospital director,

91
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,170
what are your opinions?

92
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,870
I have a theory.

93
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,870
Why can't

94
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,570
the nurse's ghost find the director?

95
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
It's possible

96
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,150
that the director

97
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,890
isn't among the people in this hospital now.

98
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,270
Has the director become a ghost?

99
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,470
You saw the portraits of the dead in the director's office, didn't you?

100
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,670
Logically speaking,

101
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,740
that nurse can easily

102
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,310
kill the NPCs here.

103
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,850
If the director is in the nursing room,

104
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,270
he would hardly stand a chance of surviving.

105
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,270
So,

106
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,830
he must have adopted a special approach

107
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,590
to avoid that nurse.

108
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,830
But up till now,

109
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,690
we haven't seen the director yet.

110
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,830
So,

111
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,150
my guess is

112
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,230
he's hiding among the door-passing shepherds,

113
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,290
just like Xu Jin who's connected to the human skin drum.

114
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,860
That's about a previous door challenge we took,

115
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,750
where the Door Ghost hid among the door-passing shepherds.

116
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,510
How could that be possible?

117
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,270
Wouldn't it be a flagrant foul?

118
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,330
It's no foul at all.

119
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
In this world,

120
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,750
there aren't fixed rules.

121
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,760
This is so mentally demanding.

122
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,890
These are what you've referred to

123
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,910
as dangers and secrets, aren't they?

124
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,950
Now things aren't clear yet.

125
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,830
But we can say with certainty

126
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,970
that the key is related to the photos in the director's office.

127
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,190
By the way,

128
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,630
didn't we plan to go to the mortuary again,

129
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,960
and look for the tunnel?

130
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,830
Are you good to go now?

131
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,470
Let me have one more bite.

132
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,470
Let's go.

133
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,470
Many dead bodies have been removed.

134
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,930
When were they taken away?

135
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,430
Yesterday?

136
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,230
Those dead bodies

137
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,320
must have been moved to the tunnel.

138
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,910
Are we

139
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,950
really gonna sneak out at night?

140
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,310
What if we run into that nurse's ghost and...

141
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,990
Being killed by that nurse's ghost

142
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,830
is better than waiting for death.

143
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,950
You are

144
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,950
incredibly audacious.

145
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,990
Mengmeng?

146
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,600
This doll and the one in the director's office are from the same set!

147
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,360
A Russian nesting doll?

148
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,910
It's empty inside.

149
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,350
It looks like

150
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,790
this part of her body was torn by force.

151
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,510
There's a wound here.

152
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,510
It seems to be caused by a fork.

153
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,470
What is this?

154
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,390
Residue of crackers.

155
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,350
Did she eat outside the canteen?

156
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,030
No way.

157
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,630
I don't think she'd make

158
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,160
a rookie mistake like that.

159
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,310
I guess

160
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,430
someone slipped cracker crumbs

161
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,550
into her bottle.

162
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
Who would be so wicked?

163
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,720
For some people,

164
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,050
it's not a hard thing to do.

165
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,430
If you feel hungry,

166
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,680
you can eat some of this.

167
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,630
Was she murdered by Jiang Yingrui?

168
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,230
Well, he is indeed a suspect.

169
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,430
But her abdominal injury

170
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,270
couldn't have been inflicted by a human.

171
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,550
Could it be the nurse's ghost?

172
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,110
We saw how good the nurse's ghost was with knives on the night before.

173
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,370
But this injury wasn't caused by a knife.

174
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,430
Does it mean...

175
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,710
Why don't we talk somewhere else?

176
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,950
I'd like to check out the director's office again.

177
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,950
Okay.

178
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,430
Are you alone?

179
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,150
You look a bit pale.

180
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,470
You should worry about yourself instead.

181
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,070
Aren't you afraid that the Door Ghost will hunt you down?

182
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,030
I managed to escape once, and I'm sure I can do it again.

183
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,030
Do you believe it?

184
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,390
Do you want to know how I escaped?

185
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,410
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that until we get closer.

186
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,900
The food in the canteen

187
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,030
is really spoiling everyone's appetite.

188
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,890
It's no wonder that you look pale.

189
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,310
I won't eat it.

190
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,350
That nurse said we must not eat anything from the outside.

191
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,630
Not everything an NPC says

192
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,830
is a taboo condition.

193
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,790
Even if it is,

194
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,040
I know a way to get around the rules.

195
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,750
If you are to solve a door challenge,

196
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,350
you first need to be physically strong enough.

197
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,570
Now you're doing the right thing.

198
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,860
Let me tell you something.

199
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,640
Looks like people have been here.

200
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,510
There are so many things scattered on the floor.

201
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,990
Someone else must be looking for the Director too.

202
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,190
The location of the Director's Office is not hidden.

203
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,630
It's easy for people

204
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,140
to find and investigate.

205
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,150
Something happened.

206
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,390
Wait for me!

207
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,230
Jiang Yingrui!

208
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,750
He...

209
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,910
Why did he suddenly die?

210
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,240
Why did he suddenly die?

211
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,860
Wasn't he fine this morning?

212
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,150
I don't know.

213
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,050
I was just walking around.

214
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,130
I didn't expect to find him dead here.

215
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,830
No one saw what happened?

216
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,550
How did he die?

217
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,210
Did you find anything?

218
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,600
No.

219
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,550
It's too sudden. Very strange.

220
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,870
I found this in his pocket.

221
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,870
This is the small one inside the big Russian doll.

222
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,030
It's empty.

223
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,510
Do you remember the Director's Office

224
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,710
and Mengmeng's body?

225
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,390
We all found a Russian doll in the office and on the body.

226
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,030
This one

227
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,200
and those two are from the same set.

228
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,960
Now that Jiang Yingrui is dead,

229
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,590
there's another one.

230
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,070
I think

231
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,270
that the set of Russian dolls is an important prop.

232
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,350
It's very likely the reason

233
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,610
why Jiang Yingrui didn't die last night.

234
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,790
You mean

235
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,830
he got this Russian doll

236
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,310
from somewhere special,

237
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,810
and this Russian doll saved his life.

238
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,590
We can't be sure

239
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,920
if he found the doll.

240
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,950
Also, we can't say for sure

241
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,870
that this doll prevented his death last night.

242
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,630
The fastest person to pass through this door is a Russian.

243
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,750
This Russian doll

244
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,470
must have a special ability.

245
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,430
That's why he can quickly crack the secret

246
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,349
and pass through the door.

247
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:11,230
Then why was Jiang Yingrui fine at night

248
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,390
but died during the day?

249
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,430
I think

250
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,470
Xue Zhiyun

251
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,829
was killed by him.

252
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,780
I was just walking around.

253
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,839
I didn't expect to find him dead here.

254
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,630
Cheng.

255
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,190
Can you stop asking questions

256
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,990
and give us advice?

257
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,740
Sorry, you're so good.

258
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,030
So I can only ask questions

259
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,430
to help you think.

260
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,190
So you're my hype man.

261
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,630
Thank you.

262
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,230
What about you?

263
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,270
What do you think?

264
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,670
Do you think

265
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,160
the Director killed Jiang Yingrui?

266
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Why?

267
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,750
None of us

268
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,790
have seen the nurse during the day.

269
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,250
So she's not the murderer.

270
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,030
Jiang Yingrui said

271
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,750
that he changed his room on a whim,

272
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,080
so he dodged the bullet.

273
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,670
But none of us saw it.

274
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,350
I think

275
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,150
that he might have

276
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,630
violated the taboo conditions.

277
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,480
And you speculated earlier

278
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,990
that the Director might be hiding among the players.

279
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,750
Is there a possibility that...

280
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,750
Yes.

281
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,550
Yes.

282
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,390
What... What possibility?

283
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,920
What are you talking about?

284
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,910
His body is the same as Mengmeng's body.

285
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,430
Yes.

286
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,550
He had injuries on his back,

287
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,590
and his legs were broken.

288
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,050
They're all knife wounds.

289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,390
It's the nurse

290
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,660
who did this to him.

291
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,710
It is likely

292
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,240
that Jiang Yingrui was in his room last night.

293
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,390
Could it be that last night...

294
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,990
Jiang Yingrui was already dead?

295
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,990
Yes.

296
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,150
What are you talking about?

297
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,710
Then what do you say about this morning?

298
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,990
Think about it.

299
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,750
Jiang Yingrui

300
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,230
was indeed suspicious this morning.

301
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,230
As I said,

302
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,070
the NPCs in the game "Human Skin Drum"

303
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,750
were disguising themselves as players

304
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,750
to deceive us.

305
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,770
Then the Director here

306
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,230
is probably hoping

307
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,190
to pass through the door

308
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,430
by hiding among the players.

309
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,150
Just the way

310
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,990
he hides

311
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
is very unusual.

312
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,030
You mean

313
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,630
that the man we saw this morning is the Director,

314
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,690
not Jiang Yingrui?

315
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,670
It's so complicated.

316
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,430
Yes.

317
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,880
The dead one is the real Jiang Yingrui.

318
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,360
Do his wounds

319
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,220
look like someone has crawled out of his body to you?

320
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,590
What was that girl's name?

321
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Hu Die.

322
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,150
Right?

323
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,990
That loner?

324
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,470
Yes.

325
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,390
I got it.

326
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,040
What are you talking about?

327
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,990
Before you knew me,

328
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,360
how did you pass through the doors?

329
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
With my good luck.

330
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,910
Good luck?

331
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,630
Then why do you want to know everything?

332
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,470
Because what you said makes sense.

333
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,950
But I just want to refute you.

334
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,950
Refute me?

335
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,320
Then, please pass through the doors by yourself.

336
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,870
Are you ready?

337
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,310
Are we really

338
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,830
going to find the tunnel?

339
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,070
Stay here if you're scared.

340
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,230
No. I'll go with you.

341
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,150
You'd better stay.

342
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,950
I can do it!

343
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,950
Just stay here.

344
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,110
Do you hear me?

345
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,670
Fine.

346
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,420
Hiding it so well.

347
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,160
Should we follow them to check?

348
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,390
No, it's too dangerous to go now.

349
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,950
Let's go check there tomorrow morning.

350
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,850
There's someone up there.

351
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,290
What are you carrying?

352
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,710
Why are you running?

353
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,590
None of your business.

354
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,520
What I do has nothing to do with you!

355
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,390
The nurse's doll.

356
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,230
Why do you want it?

357
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,230
Give it back to me!

358
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,390
She's coming back.

359
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,150
If she didn't see the doll, we'd all die.

360
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,150
She?

361
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,530
You mean that nurse?

362
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,870
Why did you steal her doll?

363
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,870
I'm not stealing.

364
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,390
I just think this is very important.

365
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,390
What if the key is inside?

366
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,760
I just want to take it back and check it.

367
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,710
Don't you think your excuse

368
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,630
is too flimsy?

369
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,890
I'm telling the truth!

370
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,750
This doll can only be brought out at night.

371
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,010
It will cry if you touch it during the day!

372
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,510
Okay, we'll go back.

373
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,430
Okay, let's go.

374
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Let's go.

375
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,590
What's wrong?

376
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,230
She's here.

377
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,670
Why is she here?

378
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,490
I got the 502 number plate.

379
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,870
It's the 502 now.

380
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,790
I left in a hurry.

381
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,470
I only thought, "Don't leave it to Tan Zaozao."

382
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,470
Where is she now?

383
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,230
Fourth floor.

384
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,590
This way.

385
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,390
Where is she now?

386
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,150
Her footsteps are gone.

387
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,080
I can't hear her.

388
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,550
Let me take the doll.

389
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,590
It's very dangerous.

390
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,750
No, I can do it.

391
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,570
Less talk and walking faster.

392
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,280
Don't... don't kill me!

393
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,470
Not me!

394
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,590
Not me! Not me!

395
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,310
Not me! Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

396
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,310
Not me!

397
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,790
It's so late.

398
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,400
Why aren't you guys back in your rooms?

399
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,030
We'll help you find the person you're looking for.

400
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,080
Thank God, it works.

401
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,690
You can communicate with her.

402
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,280
I was trying my luck.

403
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,990
I'm not 100% sure about that.

404
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,950
Let's go back.

405
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,260
No, just wait here.

406
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,120
Wait for him to come out.

407
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,340
Do you remember Mengmeng and Jiang Yingrui?

408
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,510
They both have a big gash on their bellies.

409
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,190
Let's see who's hiding inside.

410
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,270
Help me!

411
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,790
I'm not dead yet.

412
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,030
Why! Why are you still alive?

413
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,190
What a pity.

414
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,790
She let us go.

415
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,390
Because

416
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,310
we can help her get rid of you.

417
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,390
Why would you do that?

418
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,910
Guess

419
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,790
why she tried to kill you first?

420
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,270
Look at your pocket.

421
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,240
You think you'll see two mangled bodies

422
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,950
when you wake up?

423
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,790
Sorry to disappoint you.

424
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,390
Where are you going?

425
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,650
None of your business!

426
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,870
Of course, it's my business.

427
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,150
Do you think I'll let you go

428
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,270
to find a new body?

429
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

430
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,390
One more thing.

431
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,590
You've run out of your Russian dolls.

432
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,630
Russian doll? What doll?

433
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,870
Give it to me!

434
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,750
How did you know?

435
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,590
Before I entered the room,

436
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,030
everyone claimed that the quickest person to pass through the door

437
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
was a Russian.

438
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,750
I didn't pay too much attention to it at first.

439
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,470
Until I saw this Russian doll

440
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,210
in the Director's Office.

441
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,390
Later, I saw it

442
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,630
on Mengmeng and Jiang Yingrui's bodies.

443
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,310
Then I'm sure it's a key prop.

444
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,190
Now it seems

445
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,960
like you just want to pretend to be a player

446
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,580
to escape.

447
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,590
Every time you change your body,

448
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,910
it will consume a layer of the Russian dolls.

449
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,470
There's only one doll left, one chance left.

450
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,820
But since you met us,

451
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,750
don't change again.

452
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,510
I'll kill you!

453
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,150
Please let me go.

454
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,610
I don't want to die.

455
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,100
I didn't do anything.

456
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,790
Why should I die?

457
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,790
Are you sure?

458
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,150
You don't know

459
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,230
what you did?

460
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,870
Director.

461
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,550
We finally met.

462
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,310
What should we do now?

463
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,350
Tie him up

464
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,030
and let the nurse take care of him.

465
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,030
Okay.

466
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,750
Untie me!

467
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,230
Untie me!

468
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,510
This... is for you.

469
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,870
Do you think

470
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,430
you can dodge the bullet?

471
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,870
You'll only die more miserably than me.

472
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,190
Is this a curse?

473
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,690
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

474
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,030
Without the protection of the other's body,

475
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,960
it's easy for the nurse to kill him.

476
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,070
Let's go. Let's go check out the tunnel.

477
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,110
Okay.

478
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,870
You're finally back.

479
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,200
Did you find the tunnel?

480
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,270
Yes.

481
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,630
The door is in the tunnel.

482
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,150
Great.

483
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,830
Can we get out of here soon?

484
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,150
I couldn't help but wonder

485
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,020
why the Director went to steal the doll in the middle of the night.

486
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,950
Is the key hidden in the doll?

487
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,400
What doll?

488
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Who?

489
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,550
Director?

490
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,470
Could you please not speak in riddles

491
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,110
and make it clearer?

492
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,270
No.

493
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,350
How could you reject me so bluntly?

494
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,150
Be quiet.

495
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,850
We'll take you to find the key.

496
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,160
Let's go.

497
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,590
Go.

498
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,870
If the key is hidden in the doll

499
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,750
and the nurse has the doll,

500
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,150
what should we do?

501
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,630
Should we take the doll away from her?

502
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,230
We can't find a perfect plan inside the door.

503
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,870
We can only play it by ear now.

504
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,390
No matter what happens,

505
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,800
you two should protect yourselves first.

506
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,190
It's already past eight.

507
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,390
Why are you still up?

508
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,850
People all think she is scary.

509
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,790
But who knows

510
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,250
that she is just a woman betrayed by her love?

511
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,910
She is a despairing soul who needs comfort

512
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,150
behind her ferociousness and anger.

513
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,910
Love begets hate.

514
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,680
Love begets horror.

515
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,630
How do you know her so well?

516
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,960
You know nothing!

517
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,720
You have no idea how much I've done.

518
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,550
All men in the world are the same.

519
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,270
So full of yourselves,

520
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,240
and toying with other people's feelings.

521
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,450
We've caught the scumbag for you.

522
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,670
Next,

523
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,000
you have to tell us where the key is.

524
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,230
Key?

525
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,160
I don't have the key.

526
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,350
None of you are going anywhere tonight.

527
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,870
It's already past eight,

528
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,330
but you are still outside.

529
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,950
You are not good either.

530
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,430
Everyone must atone

531
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,150
for the world with their lives.

532
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,150
What did I say?

533
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,310
None of you will end up well.

534
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Don't worry.

535
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,360
You'll be the next.

536
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
Do you care so much about that child?

537
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,070
You lost your child

538
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,750
and life.

539
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,630
We have no objection

540
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,030
that you revenge yourself on that scumbag.

541
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,429
But you said the world was ruthless.

542
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,989
Hasn't there been

543
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,520
one single touching moment

544
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,409
that warmed you in this world?

545
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,790
I read your resume.

546
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,199
You're an excellent graduate.

547
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,230
I read your work evaluation.

548
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,390
Aren't those compliments and praise

549
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,510
the kindness of the world to you?

550
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,690
You fell in love with someone.

551
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,030
You thought

552
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,470
life could be better.

553
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,830
But who knew

554
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,050
he trifled with your feelings

555
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,070
and abandoned you.

556
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,350
He ruined you.

557
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,360
I've never experienced

558
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,190
how it feels to have one's work,

559
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,230
life, children and relationship ruined,

560
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,630
but I understand you.

561
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,350
It's not easy for you.

562
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,150
The pressure, pain, and the feeling of hurt you suffered

563
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,790
made you despair of the world.

564
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,150
That's why you choose to end your life.

565
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,630
I just feel sorry for you.

566
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,390
You could have chosen not to torture yourself.

567
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,650
You could have treated yourself better.

568
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,210
Such a toxic relationship

569
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,590
is not worth reminiscing.

570
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,230
It's not worth sacrificing.

571
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,830
What he lost

572
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,800
is someone who loves him.

573
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,790
What you lost

574
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,550
is someone who doesn't love you.

575
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,890
You have to understand

576
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,590
this is a good thing for you.

577
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,990
If you had understood this earlier,

578
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,590
now

579
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,390
you would hold

580
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,830
a child with flesh and blood in your arms.

581
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,230
It wouldn't be like this.

582
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,230
Why didn't anyone tell me this before?

583
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,030
Why did everyone blame me for being unrestrained?

584
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,040
They laughed at me for having nothing.

585
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,990
What did I do wrong?

586
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,590
Why did this world treat me like this?

587
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,870
You

588
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,450
did nothing wrong.

589
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,670
Your love

590
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,590
was pure.

591
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,350
You just

592
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,760
loved the wrong person.

593
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
You can leave now.

594
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,110
We're leaving.

595
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,030
Take care.

596
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,590
You want to escape?

597
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,270
Impossible.

598
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,150
This is a self-destruct device installed by the hospital.

599
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,150
If anything happens,

600
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,270
all exits will be closed

601
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,590
and fatal gas will be released.

602
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,830
How can he be so cruel?

603
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,400
Let's go to the tunnel.

604
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Let's go.

605
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,070
This is fair.

606
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,630
No one can escape.
