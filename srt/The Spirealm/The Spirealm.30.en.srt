00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,390
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,990
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,960
The urgent matter is

4
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,080
to find the key as soon as possible.

5
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,390
By the way, we found the door.

6
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,030
Don't make it public.

7
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,710
Great.

8
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,630
We've also found the Door Ghost.

9
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,560
The Door Ghost inside this door is too quiet.

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,620
Leave the key to us,

11
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,640
and you go look for Cui Xueyi.

12
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Remember,

13
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,039
be careful.

14
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,990
Okay.

15
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,990
So far,

16
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,790
there's not a single clue

17
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,180
about the key.

18
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,110
I feel like we're missing something.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,750
I found that big pot at the entrance of the school

20
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,030
strange.

21
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,810
Are you suspecting

22
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
that the key is in that water pot?

23
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,810
I'm reminded of Gao Dawei's hint:

24
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,190
Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror.

25
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,630
Do you remember the female painter's door?

26
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,870
I told you

27
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,730
about the moon I saw in the mirror.

28
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,910
Yes.

29
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,070
I even said

30
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,270
that there's no moon during the day.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,630
Unfortunately,

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,750
I didn't know the clue "Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror" at that time.

33
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,829
I just missed it.

34
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,370
So, are you suggesting

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,910
that if there are lotus flowers in the water pot,

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,770
it signifies "flowers in water"?

37
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,280
Gao Dawei is straightforward like me,

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,829
not much of a schemer.

39
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,480
He just gave it to me.

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,790
But didn't you say there was nothing

41
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,650
in the water pot when you checked?

42
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,590
Is it possible that

43
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,110
the water pot wasn't filled to the brim?

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,520
How long does it take to fill the water pot?

45
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,910
When we first arrived,

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,870
there was nothing inside.

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,510
After entering the school, and then coming out,

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,240
it took about fifteen minutes.

49
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,630
If we calculate the total capacity of the water pot,

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,630
divide it by the amount filled in those 15 minutes,

51
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,110
and then multiply by 15 minutes...

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,970
Just tell me the answer directly.

53
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,370
It takes approximately three hours,

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,410
which is exactly the time it takes to walk there.

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,230
How about this?

56
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,400
Tomorrow morning, we'll take off the Sunny Doll,

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,500
sing the song to summon the rain,

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,100
and go there with umbrellas to see the results.

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,030
I know where Cui Xueyi is.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,970
He's inside the secret room in the old man's room.

61
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
What?

62
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,880
Your conscience suddenly kicked in?

63
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,840
My boyfriend was killed by him.

64
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,829
I want to avenge him.

65
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Go to hell!

66
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,590
Stop chasing.

67
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,520
The umbrella is broken.

68
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,630
He got away again.

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,270
He got caught in the rain.

70
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,870
The Door Ghost will definitely not let him off.

71
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,750
Cui Xueyi,

72
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,230
you promised not to leave me!

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,390
You bastard!

74
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,920
It's all your fault.

75
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,950
Why don't you die?

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,630
Why don't you die?

77
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,070
If it weren't for you,

78
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,420
we wouldn't be in this mess.

79
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,630
The umbrella handle is cracked.

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,110
Oh no. I can't open the umbrella.

81
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,920
We can't go to the school tomorrow.

82
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
Let me see.

83
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,730
I didn't expect the key to be hidden in the umbrella.

84
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,390
Now that we have the key

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,030
and know where the door is,

86
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,190
even if we go to the school in the rain during the day,

87
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,150
we can pass the door

88
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,390
before facing punishment at night.

89
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,710
A foul is a foul,

90
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,270
violating the taboo conditions

91
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,730
won't just be overlooked.

92
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,760
Even if there's a chance to escape,

93
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,910
I think

94
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,130
it's best for us not to take that risk.

95
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,470
Is there any other way?

96
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,230
Yes.

97
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,830
It seems

98
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,770
that we have to ask Wang Di for help tomorrow.

99
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,090
Lin Sen, Yun Shan, are you looking for me?

100
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,630
We found the key,

101
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,090
but we need your help to open the door.

102
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,120
What do you need me to do?

103
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,850
Take off the Sunny Doll

104
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,150
four hours later.

105
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,270
then recite a nursery rhyme.

106
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,410
This will make it rain,

107
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,110
and we need that heavy rain

108
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,190
to uncover a clue.

109
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,560
I'll choose the right time for it later.

110
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,630
The Sunny Doll's effectiveness lasts for a day.

111
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,090
Put on the Sunny Doll again

112
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,430
three hours later.

113
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,830
Then the sky will clear up.

114
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,750
Follow the path to the school,

115
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,310
and you'll find the door.

116
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
Okay.

117
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,049
Be careful on your way.

118
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,270
Let's meet outside the door.

119
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Let's go.

120
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,320
(Sunny Doll. May tomorrow's weather be clear.)

121
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,920
(Just like the sky in my dreams. If it's sunny, I'll give you a golden bell.)

122
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,390
Just ten minutes left.

123
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,390
Let's go.

124
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,030
Surprised?

125
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,630
I've got a life-saving prop

126
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,090
that kept me from getting soaked in the rain.

127
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,030
We're passing the door soon.

128
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,150
Let's resolve our conflicts and move forward,

129
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,390
pretending that the past never happened.

130
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,870
Okay?

131
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,760
I'll take you to the X organization when I get out.

132
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,470
Li Dongyuan was stupid.

133
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,190
I didn't mean to hurt him.

134
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,030
He just didn't avoid it.

135
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
I promise,

136
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,190
I won't harm you guys

137
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,030
in all the doors ahead, okay?

138
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,190
Fine.

139
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,830
This is not over!

140
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,510
Sunny Doll.

141
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,690
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

142
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,610
Just like the sky in my dreams.

143
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,280
If it's sunny, I'll give you a golden bell.

144
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,310
I'll kill you.

145
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,390
Sunny Doll.

146
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,670
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

147
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,630
If you listen to my wish,

148
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
I'll give you sweet wine to drink.

149
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,830
Sunny Doll.

150
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,050
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

151
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,310
If it's still

152
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,880
cloudy and rainy tomorrow,

153
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,360
I'll chop off your head.

154
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,750
Let's go. It's going to rain.

155
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,750
Hurry up.

156
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,230
The teacher has been blocking the door.

157
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,630
It must be related to the clues of this door.

158
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,990
The Door Ghost looks sorrowful.

159
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,790
There must be some unresolved matters.

160
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,100
Unresolved matters?

161
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,990
There's another story.

162
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,030
It is said that in a village where it rained incessantly,

163
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,630
crops were about to fail.

164
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,030
The villagers, in their ignorance,

165
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,070
heard of a method:

166
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,150
chopping off someone's head and hanging it in the yard

167
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,210
would make the torrential rain stop.

168
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,710
The villagers, believing in this superstition,

169
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,990
selected a child.

170
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,830
The village school teacher

171
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,110
tried to dissuade them from this foolish act,

172
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,040
explaining that

173
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,430
the village, situated between mountains and the sea, was naturally rainy.

174
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,310
The villagers, unwilling to listen,

175
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,170
insisted on sacrificing a child.

176
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,510
The school teacher, determined to sacrifice himself in place of the student.

177
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,480
The ignorant villagers

178
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,910
wrapped the teacher's head in white cloth

179
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,630
and hung it high.

180
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,270
Back then, the villagers here were ignorant,

181
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,920
unwilling to heed warnings, and sacrificed in vain.

182
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,380
Fortunately, the teacher sacrificed himself

183
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,790
to save those children.

184
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,720
Despite being harmed by ignorant villagers,

185
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,920
the teacher's heart

186
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,150
seemed to hold no resentment.

187
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,070
Instead, he stayed here

188
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,590
to dispel

189
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,030
the resentment in the hearts of

190
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,110
those victims turned into the Sunny Dolls,

191
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,240
replacing the sorrow with their faces

192
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,470
into smiles.

193
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,350
Teacher,

194
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,190
the weather in this town is always calm and pleasant.

195
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,190
The villagers

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,390
will never forget you.

197
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,570
There's really a bonus scene.

198
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,400
This is a clue left by Gao Dawei for you.

199
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,430
Take a look first.

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,070
Wait,

201
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,030
why is it always a kaleidoscope?

202
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,190
There's nothing in it.

203
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,950
Does a regular kaleidoscope

204
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,750
need such a flashy entrance?

205
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,310
Stop looking.

206
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,810
Let's go back and study it.

207
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,000
Open the door first.

208
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay.

209
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,870
Why is there no note?

210
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,790
Two leave, one returns.

211
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,850
What are you doing?

212
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,710
Let's go.

213
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,910
Hey.

214
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,630
Coming.

215
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,450
So the flowers in the water you mentioned

216
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,090
is the lotus in the pot?

217
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,990
Right.

218
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,540
What happened

219
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,350
is surprisingly consistent with the literal meaning.

220
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,210
Did you notice anything unusual?

221
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,150
Like, dropped note.

222
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,870
This is the common way for game equipment to appear.

223
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,130
I didn't see it anyway.

224
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,870
What about you?

225
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,680
Of course, I didn't.

226
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,910
They told me

227
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,200
that Cui Xueyi had an accident.

228
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,880
He drove out of the highway.

229
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,870
He deserved it.

230
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,830
Unfortunately,

231
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,870
we didn't hear anything from Yan Balang.

232
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
There's no rush.

233
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,630
He will come to us.

234
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
How do you know?

235
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,190
He won't let us off.

236
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,880
Tell Zhuang about this.

237
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,830
(Ruan, I need to talk to you)

238
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,580
Zaozao sent me a message.

239
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,270
Come with me.

240
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,670
Okay.

241
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,829
Why are we looking for her?

242
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,510
For her movie premiere.

243
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,569
I didn't want to go.

244
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,119
But since Li Dongyuan's accident,

245
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,640
you've been in a bad mood.

246
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,670
You can take this chance to relax.

247
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,950
Her movie was shot

248
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,869
before she entered Sako, right?

249
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,440
It's a tragic movie.

250
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,810
I'm used to seeing her in the door.

251
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
It would be fun

252
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,450
to watch her act in a tragic movie.

253
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,010
You fell asleep too?

254
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,750
Zaozao. Zaozao.

255
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,030
Zaozao.

256
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,590
She has so many fans.

257
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,590
Zaozao. Zaozao.

258
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,510
Who would have thought

259
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,000
that Zaozao in the real world is like this?

260
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,170
Have you ever thought that

261
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,470
the world inside the door is real?

262
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,430
And everything we're experiencing now

263
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,470
is virtual.

264
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,270
Of course, I have.

265
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,950
But I can't figure it out.

266
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,910
If it were you,

267
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,750
would you choose a real but scary world

268
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,590
or a virtual but safe world?

269
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,510
I'll choose

270
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,030
wherever you are.

271
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,350
Actually, I've always had a dream.

272
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,510
If my mom could stay young

273
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,150
while I grow up,

274
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,520
that would be great.

275
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,830
This movie

276
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,670
has indirectly achieved my dream.

277
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,190
I also want to thank the producer

278
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,720
for giving me such a chance.

279
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,830
Of course...

280
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,600
The 6th door of Zaozao is about to open.

281
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,150
Are you really not going to company her in her 6th door?

282
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,150
I wish you

283
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,910
can always stay with the person you love.

284
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,170
It's tiring to socialize.

285
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,760
I'd rather enter a door.

286
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,670
Just kidding.

287
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,430
No matter how tiring social life is, people won't die.

288
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,750
Lingling,

289
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,160
thank you for coming to watch my new movie.

290
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,830
We have to thank you

291
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,390
for inviting us here.

292
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,390
Will a tragic movie be a big hit?

293
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,040
This is not a commercial movie.

294
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,710
It's for getting awards.

295
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,600
I have to say congratulations in advance.

296
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,810
Lingling is always on my side.

297
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,990
Ruan,

298
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,350
how's my acting?

299
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,630
Remarkable.

300
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Your progress has been remarkable.

301
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,950
Ruan.

302
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,870
You...

303
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,150
really can't company me in the 6th door?

304
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,070
The 6th door.

305
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,550
I'm not sure if I can come out.

306
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,550
It's not impossible.

307
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,830
But, you have to do as I say.

308
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,710
What is it?

309
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,590
From now on,

310
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,210
you need to enter more doors with me to gain experience.

311
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,110
After the 6th door,

312
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,910
the difficulty increases exponentially.

313
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,110
It's far more dangerous than you think.

314
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,310
If I keep entering doors,

315
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,030
can you guarantee

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,670
that I can

317
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,730
get out of the 6th door safe and sound?

318
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,050
I can't promise you anything.

319
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,130
Your chance of success

320
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,750
will be much higher

321
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,510
than now.

322
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,910
Ruan.

323
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Lingling.

324
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,990
I don't have the courage and guts

325
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,310
to face everything inside the door.

326
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,710
If I have to

327
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,490
experience the world inside the door again,

328
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,950
I'd rather die.

329
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,970
Dead as a doornail.

330
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,350
Zaozao.

331
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,310
I've seen your state in the door.

332
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,750
I believe

333
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,200
you can adapt to the world inside the door.

334
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
I'm really...

335
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,190
scared.

336
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,470
It's a physical fear.

337
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,990
Then I really can't help you.

338
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,550
Ruan,

339
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,230
can you please

340
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,440
help me

341
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,230
just for old time's sake?

342
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,870
Please.

343
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,950
I'll help you in the door.

344
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,950
Really?

345
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,510
Nonsense.

346
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,550
You've passed a low-level door alone

347
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,310
so far.

348
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,310
Li Dongyuan sacrificed his life to save you.

349
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,040
How can you protect Tan Zaozao?

350
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,990
Because there's nothing I could do

351
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,510
about Li Dongyuan's death.

352
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,230
I don't want to lose my friend,

353
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,230
Tan Zaozao.

354
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,690
You're not saving her.

355
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,630
You're just going to die with her.

356
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,290
Isn't that what friends mean?

357
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,930
The meaning of friends

358
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,670
is to live for each other,

359
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,630
not to die for each other.

360
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,110
Alright.

361
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,550
Lingling,

362
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
thank you.

363
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,710
That

364
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,190
means a lot.

365
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,490
I understand Ruan.

366
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,470
I won't force you.

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
I have an event to attend.

368
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,870
I have to go.

369
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,240
There's still some time before entering.

370
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,560
If you change your mind,

371
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,490
you can come to me anytime.

372
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,510
Also,

373
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't advocate it.

374
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,630
But if you're really scared,

375
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,400
you can buy some props on the forum.

376
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,790
Don't be fooled.

377
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,950
Are you mad at me?

378
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,790
No.

379
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,590
You're right.

380
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,710
I just don't want you to be so cold-blooded.

381
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,870
Is it hot-blooded

382
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,610
to die for a friend?

383
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,190
You can die,

384
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,250
then who will live for you?

385
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,070
You can live,

386
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,000
why did you choose to give up your life?

387
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,040
I just don't want Tan Zaozao to suffer so much.

388
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,710
You'll understand

389
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,270
that some pain must be endured alone.

390
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,920
Can't I help her in the door?

391
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,790
You can quickly adapt to the life in the door.

392
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,590
Not everyone is like you.

393
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,390
Tan Zaozao.

394
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,510
She's already very resistant to entering the door.

395
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,870
Do you want her to be like Yi Manman,

396
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,270
who can't distinguish the world outside and inside the door?

397
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,230
Ling Jiushi.

398
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,820
Zhang... Mingyu.

399
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,150
I didn't expect

400
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
to meet you here.

401
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,070
I just came back from overseas.

402
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,270
I used to like to watch Tan Zaozao's movies

403
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,470
on the Internet.

404
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,720
When I came back, a friend who knew I liked her,

405
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,950
and got me

406
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,240
one movie premiere ticket.

407
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,230
She's much prettier in person.

408
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,870
Well,

409
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,230
you went abroad with Gao Dawei.

410
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,350
Do you have any news about him?

411
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,350
Don't mention it.

412
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,270
We went abroad together,

413
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,110
but

414
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,070
we never contacted each other.

415
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,070
You're classmates and going abroad together.

416
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,830
Aren't you supposed to help each other?

417
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,230
I had a fight with him.

418
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,830
Why didn't I know?

419
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,350
It was because of you.

420
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,110
Me?

421
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,030
Gao, when is your flight?

422
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,190
Half a month later.

423
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,790
I have to deal with some family issues.

424
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,990
You are earlier than me.

425
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,420
Tell me when you get there.

426
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,510
If you forgot something,

427
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,640
I'll bring it to you.

428
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,630
Are you looking for Ling Jiushi?

429
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,880
I want to say goodbye to him.

430
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,870
Why are you looking for that loser?

431
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,400
Who are you calling a loser?

432
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,630
You told me

433
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,070
that you went to help with earthquake relief work.

434
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,990
But he got caught in a secondary collapse,

435
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,230
and was trapped under the ruins.

436
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,440
He didn't save others,

437
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,710
but he needed others to save him instead.

438
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,230
Tell me.

439
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,310
How much trouble he has brought to the people who were coping with the disaster.

440
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,110
In my opinion,

441
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,870
he would not be here

442
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,160
without you.

443
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,550
You know nothing.

444
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,720
Without him,

445
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,270
these people can't survive.

446
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,230
He sacrificed himself.

447
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,870
Gao,

448
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,190
you're just saying nice things.

449
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,190
In my opinion,

450
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
he is a loser.

451
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,550
Let me tell you.

452
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,830
He's not a loser.

453
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,190
At the critical moment,

454
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,740
he dared to help, and then he's hero.

455
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Unlike you,

456
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,590
you only hide behind

457
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,590
and be a troll.

458
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,750
He

459
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,630
really said that?

460
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,510
Why would I lie to you?

461
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,190
It's a fight, not a good thing.

462
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,870
Back then, I didn't understand.

463
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,230
But then I thought about it,

464
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,790
you were really warm-hearted.

465
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,350
If anything happened to classmates,

466
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,740
you were always the first one to help them.

467
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaking of which,

468
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,490
I should apologize to you.

469
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,070
I really didn't expect that.

470
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,570
I always felt a little inadequate

471
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,750
by his side.

472
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,150
Don't be.

473
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,090
He didn't think like that either.

474
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,970
What? You two haven't contacted each other?

475
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,130
I've been looking for him lately.

476
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,800
I asked many people,

477
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,030
but I got nothing yet.

478
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,360
That's easy.

479
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,550
When I go back,

480
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,630
I'll send emails to my friends abroad

481
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,870
and ask them to look for him.

482
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,870
I'll let you know

483
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,040
once I hear any news.

484
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,870
Thank you.

485
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,080
We're classmates. Don't say that.

486
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,030
By the way,

487
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,270
you seem to be quite close with Tan Zaozao.

488
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,000
Get me an autographed picture.

489
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,190
No problem.

490
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,270
See you later.

491
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,670
Okay, take care.

492
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,950
I didn't expect the college dorm

493
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,080
to be so meaningful.

494
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,070
We have a lot of things we regret in life.

495
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,590
Life is all about missing out

496
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and regretting.

497
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,840
You must want to see him now.

498
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,710
I do have a lot to ask him.

499
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,310
Since he went abroad,

500
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,210
we haven't contacted each other.

501
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,750
But he knew where I was

502
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,430
and sent packages to me.

503
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,490
It means that he has been watching me.

504
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Anyway,

505
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,670
it's fate.

506
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,530
I want to purify this game.

507
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,190
So does he.

508
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,750
We have to pass 12 doors.

509
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,710
So, you want to pass 12 doors.

510
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,160
Are you doing this for yourself

511
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,880
or for something else?

512
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,690
Just like Li Dongyuan.

513
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,090
He was protecting the families of the dead players.

514
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,070
And I want to solve this problem

515
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,150
from the root.

516
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,150
I don't want to see the teenagers in China

517
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,350
get hurt by this game.

518
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,670
I want this game

519
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,330
back to its original form.

520
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
So,

521
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,400
you are not that cold-blooded.

522
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,230
After you finish

523
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,360
and purify the game,

524
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,830
what do you want to do?

525
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,550
Obsidian won't exist forever.

526
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,230
But when this game is purified,

527
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,110
it's time for us to go our separate ways.

528
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,550
I suddenly don't want to ruin the game.

529
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,170
I just don't want to leave you.

530
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,470
You haven't answered me yet.

531
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,170
What do you want to do after passing the game?

532
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,270
I hadn't thought this far

533
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,910
into the future.

534
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Maybe

535
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,280
there will be a new game.

536
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,730
We can keep working together.

537
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,900
I'm looking forward to it.

538
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,070
What are you doing in the middle of the day?

539
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,670
I thought you were kidnapped.

540
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,670
You don't understand.

541
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,950
This is a special training method.

542
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,870
Why are you watching horror movies again?

543
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,470
The 7th door is about to open.

544
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,070
Yes.

545
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,310
It will open soon.

546
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,610
About half a month.

547
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Are you ready?

548
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,470
Ready?

549
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,550
Get ready for what?

550
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,230
Actually, I have nothing to prepare.

551
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,790
My brother has all the notes.

552
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,190
He didn't show them to me.

553
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,270
Maybe he's preparing.

554
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,170
Just the two of you?

555
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,230
Why don't you come with us?

556
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,110
I want to.

557
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,670
But I still lack experience.

558
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,870
I don't want to get you into trouble.

559
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,230
The door

560
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,340
is getting harder after the 5th door.

561
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,940
I can't let you take the risk.

562
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,910
So,

563
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,910
you must listen to your brother

564
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,270
after you enter,

565
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,230
and come back safe and sound.

566
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,550
Where's your brother? I haven't seen him for a long time.

567
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,550
Him?

568
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,230
Cheng Yixie.

569
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,720
You're risking your life.

570
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,280
Why won't you ever listen to me?

571
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,190
Ruan.

572
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,670
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,030
This is to drink poison to quench thirst, you know?

574
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,030
If it works, I'll drink the poison.

575
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,330
It's good that Qianli can quench thirst.

576
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,030
Ruan.

577
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,720
Qianli.

578
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,880
What did you say you wanted to eat?

579
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,230
Eat...

580
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,870
I want to eat hotpot.

581
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Hotpot?

582
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,070
Your brother seems to be upstairs.

583
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,430
Ask him what he wants to eat.

584
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,430
Go.

585
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,150
OK.

586
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,610
Cheng Yixie is going to take Cheng Qianli to the door.

587
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,230
The way is too extreme.

588
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,230
What is it?

589
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,160
He's going to take him to the 10th door.

590
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,950
It's too dangerous.

591
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,310
He won't enter the 7th door at all.

592
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,890
Cheng Yixie wants to take a shortcut.

593
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,520
He's too impulsive.

594
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,430
Not everyone

595
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,430
can be as calm as you.

596
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,930
But they are brothers.

597
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,700
You have to believe them.

598
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,060
They're not just friends;

599
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,430
they're brothers.

600
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,830
The more dangerous it is,

601
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,350
the calmer you should be.

602
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,470
But sometimes,

603
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,990
passion can solve problems

604
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,090
better than calmness.

605
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,710
Someone is knocking.

606
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,190
Who is it?

607
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,190
The superstar is here.

608
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,190
Come in, please.

609
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,790
I won an award.

610
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,750
I won an award.

611
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,150
You must attend

612
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,830
the awards ceremony.

613
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,470
What award?

614
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
Golden Jujube Award.

615
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,750
Best Actress.

616
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,110
Golden Jujube Award.

617
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,920
Is it the award for

618
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,850
the worst movies and worst characters every year...

619
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,630
How could Zaozao play a bad role?

620
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,070
Right?

621
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,550
Yes, that's right.

622
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,630
It doesn't matter.

623
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,310
In the past,

624
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,389
people always said I was bad at acting.

625
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,469
This time, I've expanded my career.

626
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,310
Lingling,

627
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,550
you must come.

628
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,469
You are my best friend.

629
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,030
Are you really going?

630
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,310
This award

631
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,230
has been presented for many years,

632
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,350
but no one has ever shown up to get it.

633
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,179
This is the first award in my life.

634
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,590
I have to go.

635
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,400
It's not the last time.

636
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,929
You'll definitely...

637
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,790
Don't worry.

638
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,830
I will be there.

639
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,469
Me too.

640
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,280
You're too young.

641
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,630
They will wear short dresses on the red carpet.

642
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,520
It's not a place for you.

643
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,590
You'd better watch TV at home.

644
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,070
I want to watch it.

645
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,630
Where's Ruan?

646
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I didn't see him.

647
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,270
He went to White Deer.

648
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,310
Zhuang wants to see him, like something about entering doors.

649
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,440
I've sent the invitation personally.

650
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,510
Give it to him.

651
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,680
I have something to do. I have to go.

652
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,950
Zaozao.

653
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,910
What?

654
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,830
Have you thought it through?

655
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,710
Yes, I have.

656
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,700
I won't take extra door challenges to gain more experience.

657
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,510
How are you gonna deal with your 6th door challenge?

658
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,510
Don't worry.

659
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,170
I've found a solution.

660
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,750
Ruan is right.

661
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,010
I can always buy props.

662
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,110
Props?

663
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,230
Don't forget to come to the ceremony.

664
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,560
I'll be waiting for you.

665
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,480
(Invitation)

666
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,440
(Props do work. They've saved my life!)

667
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,310
(Don't believe the props. Some people are selling fakes!)

668
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,470
(I agree! Here's a revelation: A man named Meng Yu sells fakes!)

669
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,350
It's better to believe in yourself.

670
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
What is this?

671
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,320
An invitation to an award ceremony.

672
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,450
Zaozao gave it to us.

673
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,890
(Invitation)

674
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,390
Golden Jujube?

675
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,630
Hasn't she improved her acting skills yet?

676
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,970
The time's not good for me.

677
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,270
You'll go there first on that day,

678
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,530
and I'll arrive later.

679
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,870
Are you having something to do?

680
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,930
Do you need my help?

681
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,070
No worries.

682
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,990
It's just a small matter.

683
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,990
Cheng is finally getting an award.

684
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,150
You should be there for her before I am.

685
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay.

686
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,070
When you're done with your work, go directly to the venue.

687
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,870
I need you to help me persuade her

688
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,920
to sharpen her skills by taking extra door challenges.

689
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
Okay.

690
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,890
What are you busy with?

691
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,520
I'm having a discussion

692
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,550
on the clues about the 10th door challenge.

693
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,110
Is there a result?

694
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,790
We're close to having one.

695
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,630
By the way, on the day of the ceremony,

696
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,150
buy some jujubes for her on my behalf

697
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,280
to congratulate her on winning the Golden Jujube Award.

698
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Sure.

699
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,790
Zaozao!

700
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,670
Zaozao!

701
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,760
(You deserve a bright future)

702
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:48,900
(We adore you)

703
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,310
Since the Golden Jujube Award was established 7 years ago,

704
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,870
this is the first time an award winner will attend the ceremony in person.

705
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,030
Let's welcome Miss Tan Zaozao

706
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,870
with applause and camera flash!

707
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:02,400
(Zaozao)

708
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,070
Miss Zaozao, you're so brave!

709
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,770
Are you serious about this? Just go home!

710
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,900
(The 7th Golden Jujube Award Ceremony)

711
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,030
Dear guests,

712
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,070
I'm sorry

713
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,670
to inform you that nearly no award winners are here to accept their prizes.

714
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's look at the list of award winners.

715
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,020
(Award Winners)

716
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,870
The most important award

717
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,930
was won by the only celebrity present at today's event.

718
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:39,310
The Golden Jujube Award for the worst leading actress goes to Tan Zaozao!

719
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,670
Let's give a nice round of applause

720
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,190
to Tan Zaozao.

721
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,390
Miss Tan Zaozao!

722
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,210
Let's invite Miss Tan Zaozao to the stage again!

723
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,990
It seems like we aren't clapping loudly enough

724
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,110
for Miss Tan to make an entrance.

725
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,950
Everyone,

726
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,070
let's give a big round of applause again

727
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,440
to invite Miss Tan Zaozao to the stage!

728
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,830
Sure!

729
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,870
Zaozao!

730
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,790
I'm afraid that in today's event,

731
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,190
some sort of emergency must have happened.

732
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,190
Please stay calm and patient.

733
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,190
I can't find her.

734
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,910
Neither can I.

735
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,910
Ran!

736
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,870
Have you seen Zaozao?

737
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,910
She went to the bathroom and disappeared!

738
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,110
When did that happen?

739
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,430
About 5 minutes ago.

740
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,350
Not here.

741
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,910
Not here.

742
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,610
She's nowhere to be found!

743
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,310
There are 9 minutes to go.

744
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,910
Zaozao.

745
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,870
Please come out of the door in one piece.

746
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,550
Please come back safely!

747
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,230
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,510
I'm left with no choice but to announce

749
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,040
that today's award ceremony has come to an...

750
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,710
Wait!

751
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,150
Please wait!

752
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,620
Sorry!

753
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,230
Everyone, please be patient and wait a moment.

754
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,230
I am...

755
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,470
I am Zaozao's assistant.

756
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,730
Please hear me out.

757
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,910
Zaozao truly values this award.

758
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,280
She has not run away.

759
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,830
The fact is that she has accidentally

760
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,990
smudged her make-up,

761
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,150
so now she's fixing it.

762
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,550
She'd like to look her best

763
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,270
when she makes an appearance.

764
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,350
Would you be so kind as to give her a moment?

765
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,350
Well...

766
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,030
8 minutes will do.

767
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,950
Just give her 8 minutes. Thank you.

768
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,410
Listen, pal. Come with me.

769
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,430
Go.

770
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,110
You don't even have an employee badge.

771
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,440
What are you doing here?

772
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,110
I left my employee badge in the dressing room.

773
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,240
I'll fetch it later.

774
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,470
There are 7 minutes to go.

775
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,950
Only 7 minutes to go. Please do me a favor.

776
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,950
This award does mean a lot to Zaozao.

777
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,670
Just do me a favor.

778
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,670
I'll bring her here right away.

779
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,670
Many thanks!
