00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,380
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,970
(Episode 37)

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Alright.

4
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,370
It's been a long time since you had my noodles, right?

5
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,370
Have a bite.

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I'm not hungry.

7
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Wow.

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,940
You're used to enjoying the feast there,

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,290
and looking down on my noodles, right?

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
No.

11
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Really?

12
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,560
Are you trying to escape from the truth?

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,330
No.

14
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,950
Then why did you come back?

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
You couldn't stand him lying to you?

16
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,750
If I were him, I would do the same.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,130
It's better to let me suffer in the end than

18
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,860
to let me know we'll part ways from the beginning.

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Lingling.

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Wu Qi.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,440
Even you want me to send Ruan Lanzhu to his death?

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,890
Lingling, you have to figure it out.

23
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,050
If you don't enter the door, he'll die.

24
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,840
But if you go, he may survive.

25
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,570
What do you mean?

26
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,240
It's obvious.

27
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,650
This game can't operate without Ruan Lanzhu.

28
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,110
He must go, no matter what,

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,760
even if he is doomed.

30
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,720
But if you go,

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,130
with your strength,

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,360
you two may have the chance to come back.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,120
You can make a choice

34
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,370
between all the players and him.

35
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,810
But he has no choice.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,680
He has to sacrifice himself to save others.

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,560
I understand

38
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,530
why I was given up

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
and

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,290
why he hid the truth from me,

41
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,480
but I just don't want to accept it.

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,970
I feel like I'm a fool

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,020
who can only accept the consequences

44
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,640
and understand him.

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,530
I'm more of a fool

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,570
than you are.

47
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,850
But I don't think it's bad.

48
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,170
You know what?

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,220
When you called me that day

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,210
and said you would move out,

51
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,680
I was disappointed

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
because I knew I was going to lose you.

53
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,730
But meanwhile, I was happy

54
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,710
that I was finally losing you.

55
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,770
You should have left this shabby place a long time ago.

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
All these years,

57
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,420
I've gotten used to your existence in my life.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,500
I never asked my girlfriend to move in

59
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,580
because I thought you would come back one day,

60
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,540
and I have to wait for you here.

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,720
Now you're back.

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,370
But I have to say

63
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,620
that you need to leave here.

64
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,030
You don't belong here.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,700
Wasting your talent is worse than committing suicide.

66
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,970
Ling Jiushi,

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm willing to be your best friend

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
forever.

69
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,040
But I don't want

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,120
to stay with you forever.

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,970
Do you know how talented you are

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,880
at designing or playing games?

73
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,850
I envy you.

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,210
I don't know much,

75
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,130
but I'm sure of one thing.

76
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,330
You shouldn't live like this.

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,290
If you're still here after five or ten years,

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
you're still my best friend,

79
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,120
and witness me get married and have babies,

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,840
that's the worst condition!

81
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,820
You should go to the outside world

82
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,870
to make a brighter future.

83
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,090
I've been wanting to say so for a long time.

84
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,130
But

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
I don't want to leave you.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
After going through so many things,

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
whenever I think of Li Dongyuan,

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,570
I feel so sorry.

89
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,280
I didn't even say goodbye to him.

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,730
So I firmly believe that

91
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,120
you should purify this game.

92
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,840
If I'm capable enough, I would definitely do it!

93
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,070
I'll do it, even if I'm scared!

94
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,800
So, what are you afraid of?

95
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,159
Losing Ruan Lanzhu?

96
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,170
Let me tell you.

97
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,290
I'm not afraid of losing you.

98
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,610
Because I know

99
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,980
it's the beginning for you to be yourself.

100
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,970
That's the point of me being your friend, isn't it?

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,330
If I'm going to lose you at the end of this road,

102
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,280
I will still take this farewell trip as a journey.

103
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,440
I can accompany you on the last journey,

104
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,520
just like you can do for Ruan Lanzhu.

105
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,890
It's a friend's duty, right?

106
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,970
I...

107
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,850
I...

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm not sure if I can make it.

109
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,850
You can.

110
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,170
You can do it.

111
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,560
Haven't you always wanted to use your game design

112
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,690
to change the world?

113
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,320
This is the right time.

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,850
You're saving the world, Ling Jiushi.

115
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,730
Yan Balang from America

116
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,960
tries to harm game players,

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,620
and so many kids are suffering due to him.

118
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,340
You should use your talent, representing us,

119
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,630
to beat the capital of America back to the Atlantic.

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,690
It sounds like I'll be letting myself down

121
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,290
if I waste my talent.

122
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,520
It will not let you down,

123
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
but

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,280
let us down.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
All right.

126
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,740
The noodles are soggy.

127
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Have some.

128
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
Take a bite.

129
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,970
I'm a good

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
noodle cook.

131
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Have it.

132
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,070
(Two leave, one returns)

133
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,320
I know you are inside.

134
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Don't play dead.

135
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,190
If you don't pay the rent, get out of here.

136
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,170
Listen,

137
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
if you don't pay the rent

138
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
by noon,

139
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,920
I'll smash the door.

140
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,730
You're so snobbish.

141
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,360
After I copy this game,

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,860
I'll buy the International Trade Building.

143
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,260
Only you are by my side now.

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,770
Don't worry.

145
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,840
After I copy this game,

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll give you half of the shares.

147
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,330
I will keep my word.

148
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,930
Until now,

149
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,520
do you still think I stayed by your side

150
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,650
because of money?

151
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,880
I came back from America

152
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,250
for you.

153
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,680
No, not for me,

154
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,890
but for my dream,

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,730
which is to go back to America, make a good fortune,

156
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,280
and be successful!

157
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,810
I'll go wherever you go.

158
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,940
We'll succeed soon.

159
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,690
Soon.

160
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,090
We're about to enter the door.

161
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,890
What is the clue to the 11th door?

162
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Nothing.

163
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,190
There's nothing written on the note.

164
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
It's weird.

165
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Where is it?

166
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,120
As there was nothing written on the note,

167
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,650
I didn't keep it specially.

168
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,610
It's okay.

169
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,640
At least we are more prepared

170
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,940
than Ruan Lanzhu and his partners.

171
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Let's go.

172
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,490
It's time to go.

173
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm excited now.

174
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,370
In the game world,

175
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,570
it's the first time someone has entered the 11th door.

176
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Yes.

177
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,290
Let's make a record.

178
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,440
Why are we here?

179
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
What bad luck!

180
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,450
It's so quiet.

181
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,810
It's a little scary.

182
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,890
Something's wrong.

183
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Let's go.

184
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Go.

185
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,810
Boss, we were left here

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,560
because of you.

187
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Let's settle this.

188
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,040
Are you NPCs of this door now?

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,100
We can be regarded as the Door Ghosts.

190
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,570
We can kill you directly,

191
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,290
even if you don't break the rules.

192
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,420
It's all your fault!

193
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,480
You asked me to play this game.

194
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
If it weren't for you,

195
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,530
I wouldn't have died.

196
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,560
You were the ones who chose to play the game.

197
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,650
You were the ones who failed to resist the temptation.

198
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,400
What does your death have to do with me?

199
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Alas.

200
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,170
Since it doesn't make sense,

201
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
and you like this game so much,

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,180
why don't you stay in it

203
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,120
forever

204
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,650
and be a part of it like us?

205
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,650
Be careful.

206
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,080
You yelled so loudly

207
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,130
that I was taken aback.

208
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,790
Wait, I have something to say.

209
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,170
Do you want to die again?

210
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,250
We've died once.

211
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
How can we die again?

212
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,190
Don't believe him.

213
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
He's eloquent.

214
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,370
He has fooled every one of us.

215
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,370
Yes.

216
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,130
He hasn't given me the bonus he promised.

217
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,570
Now that I'm dead,

218
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
he doesn't have to pay it.

219
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,080
But you're still alive, right?

220
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Am I right?

221
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,080
If Ling Jiushi and Ruan Lanzhu

222
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,040
ruin this game,

223
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,480
you'll die again.

224
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,090
And this time, you'll be completely dead.

225
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,260
I don't care about it

226
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,920
as long as you're buried with me.

227
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,280
You're still

228
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,360
luring us to fight against them.

229
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,090
Kill him!

230
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,570
It's not for me,

231
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,290
but for yourselves.

232
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,120
If they destroy this game,

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,460
you'll also be destroyed.

234
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
As for me,

235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,480
I want to keep this game

236
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,520
and keep you alive.

237
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,690
I didn't pay you the money.

238
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,970
But I have a good way to solve it.

239
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,870
You all have families, right?

240
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,690
Do you miss your family?

241
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes.

242
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,450
Your child is four years old, right?

243
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,970
Bai is a cute boy.

244
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
You're going to get married, right?

245
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,760
Your parents are in good health.

246
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,240
They wonder when you'll go back.

247
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,650
I know you regret participating in this game.

248
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,680
But we can do nothing now.

249
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,530
What's done is done.

250
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,170
But I...

251
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,680
I can give the money I owe you to your family.

252
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Double times.

253
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Three times.

254
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,690
Isn't that a good solution?

255
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,160
When will you give the money to our family?

256
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,370
As long as Ling Jiushi and Ruan Lanzhu die,

257
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,340
I will immediately pay you.

258
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,190
I didn't expect

259
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,440
we'd be the only three left in Obsidian.

260
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,680
To be exact,

261
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,730
only two of you are left.

262
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,560
Ruan, no matter who you are,

263
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,780
I believe our friendship is true.

264
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,870
I'm worried about you entering the door alone.

265
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Let me go with you.

266
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
No need.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
If you two can get out,

268
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,560
make sure to live well.

269
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,740
I hope I can successfully purify this game

270
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,140
and spare you from its suffering.

271
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,760
If you succeed,

272
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,540
we'll never see you again, right?

273
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,590
Maybe it's better to say goodbye now.

274
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
All right.

275
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,970
I'm leaving.

276
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,839
Wait a moment.

277
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,810
No.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
Say goodbye to him for me.

279
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
You're back.

280
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,410
I have no choice.

281
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,930
I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to Qianli and Zaozao.

282
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,400
But I have enough time to say goodbye this time.

283
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,660
I don't want to miss it.

284
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,780
So I'll say goodbye

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,770
to you ahead of time.

286
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
No matter what,

287
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,860
I won't forget you.

288
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Strange.

289
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,680
Why am I back again?

290
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,620
(Wu Qi)

291
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,680
Hello, what's up?

292
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,900
I'm still working.

293
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,180
I'll talk to you later.

294
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,760
Who are you?

295
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,370
Who am I?

296
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,570
Who are you looking for?

297
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,170
I'm looking for Ruan Lanzhu.

298
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,170
Ruan Lanzhu?

299
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,380
You've got the wrong place.

300
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,760
My friend and I used to live here.

301
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,240
How could it be wrong?

302
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,560
There's no such person here.

303
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Leave now.

304
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
That's impossible.

305
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Chestnut, if you

306
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,820
weren't so close to me,

307
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,530
I'd really think this was the real world.

308
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Hello, Zhu Meng.

309
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,610
Where are you?

310
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm not sure.

311
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,490
I'm still in the corridor.

312
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,320
I just avoided Cui Xueyi.

313
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Cui Xueyi?

314
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Jiang Yingrui was after me just now.

315
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,110
Looks like there are many old friends inside this door.

316
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,600
I couldn't reach you during the day,

317
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,330
and the ghosts appear at night.

318
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,250
Yeah, it's too dangerous.

319
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,570
I'll come to you.

320
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,570
I don't know where I am.

321
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,650
Let's meet at the Obsidian.

322
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,360
Take care of yourself.

323
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,020
Okay, see you at the Obsidian.

324
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,530
I...

325
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
It's me.

326
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,950
You...

327
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Why are you here?

328
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,610
I miss you.

329
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,960
Can't I come to play with you?

330
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Sure.

331
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,440
Ouch.

332
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,520
It hurts. You're too strong.

333
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Easy, easy.

334
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm so happy.

335
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,010
Where are we?

336
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,290
I'm not sure

337
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,670
because I don't know either.

338
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,930
If I have to explain,

339
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,170
it's the world inside the door.

340
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Wherever it is,

341
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm glad to see you again.

342
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Hey.

343
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,530
How are you?

344
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,500
What about Zhuang?

345
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,050
We're fine.

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Zhuang's...

347
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
fine too.

348
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,530
Okay.

349
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
I see.

350
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,100
Please send a message to her for me.

351
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Tell her

352
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,480
that there are many troubles in this world,

353
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,650
but her presence

354
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,120
has become a ray of light in my life.

355
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,900
Forget it. Don't tell her.

356
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,550
That's so disgusting.

357
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I know.

358
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,770
She knows too.

359
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,440
After seeing you,

360
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,890
I'm even more looking forward to this door.

361
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,520
Maybe I'll meet other friends later.

362
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Be careful.

363
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
Not everyone you meet at night is a friend,

364
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,460
they could be monsters.

365
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,490
Bro.

366
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,430
Destroy this game.

367
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,770
Good luck.

368
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Destroy the game?

369
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,610
If the game is destroyed, I'll be gone,

370
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,170
but I'm happy to.

371
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Ruan Lanzhu.

372
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,720
Let's settle our scores today!

373
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Go.

374
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
This way.

375
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,490
(Young Cai High School)

376
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,010
I ran into Li Dong Yuan just now.

377
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,830
Sako, is that you?

378
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
It's Yaoyao! Run!

379
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,100
Why did we come to the Sanatorium?

380
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,600
All the dead are coming out.

381
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,080
These are all the scenes that we've been through.

382
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,540
They may appear randomly.

383
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,470
We can't enter 502.

384
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,880
Lingling, Ruan, this way.

385
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,040
Lingling. Ruan.

386
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
I miss you so much.

387
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,050
We miss you too.

388
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,840
Zaozao, how are you doing here?

389
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,480
Generally, I'm doing quite well.

390
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,440
Maybe after becoming an NPC,

391
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,880
I don't have to worry about

392
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,560
the taboo conditions inside the door anymore.

393
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,080
Besides, Lingling, Ruan,

394
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,450
can you imagine

395
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,970
that I can protect you now?

396
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,400
Thank you for saving us.

397
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,320
Hey.

398
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,810
Don't say that.

399
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,810
It's just

400
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:18,810
that I don't know

401
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,640
where the door and the key are.

402
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,230
Otherwise, I can really show my power

403
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,770
in front of you two.

404
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,730
You've always been powerful in my heart.

405
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,930
We all feel the same, right?

406
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,170
Thank you for saving me.

407
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,910
You already said that.

408
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,610
I meant the last time.

409
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,700
Thank you for the bracelet you gave me.

410
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,560
I didn't expect that you would save me

411
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,450
even though I didn't take you pass the door.

412
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Everything worked out for the best.

413
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,120
Ruan, it's really good

414
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,000
to hear you say, "Thank you."

415
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,020
Take care of yourself.

416
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
We're leaving.

417
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,970
What?

418
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,800
It's safe here.

419
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,100
Why don't you rest for a while?

420
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,210
Okay.

421
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,370
I'll miss you.

422
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,650
We'll miss you too.

423
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,400
You're always in our hearts.

424
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Snow Village.

425
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,300
This brings back memories.

426
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,130
This is my first door.

427
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,970
This tree

428
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,180
is the place where we first met.

429
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,600
Welcome to the world inside the door.

430
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,920
They're haunting us again.

431
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,490
We have to keep running.

432
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,890
This feeling is so bad.

433
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,890
What's going on with this door?

434
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,880
All the clues we gathered before

435
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,080
no longer apply to this door challenge.

436
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,130
Why are we here?

437
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,890
Everything starts here, and it will end here.

438
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,090
Why isn't she coming in?

439
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,570
Oh no.

440
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,650
It means she has an accomplice here.

441
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,120
Jiu, is that you?

442
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,050
Run!

443
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,140
Good evening, old friend.

444
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,040
So we meet again.

445
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Tell me.

446
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,690
What's the clue to the key?

447
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,120
I should have guessed that you were behind all of this.

448
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
So what if you knew?

449
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
The more you know,

450
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,360
the more helpless you are.

451
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,930
Why do you want to know everything?

452
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,020
What is the clue to the key?

453
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Let us go.

454
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:07,960
Then I'll tell you.

455
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Okay.

456
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,969
Go ahead.

457
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,610
I promise you'll be fine.

458
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,690
My friend designed this game.

459
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,040
He left a message.

460
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,530
"Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror."

461
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,190
I found the clue, "Flowers in water."

462
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,480
"The Moon in the mirror" is in this door.

463
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,730
Tell me.

464
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,050
Two leave, one returns.

465
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,330
It's the same.

466
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,650
The answer seems clear,

467
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,570
but this door has no answer.

468
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,179
What does it have to do with the key?

469
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,840
"The Moon in the mirror" is likely the clue to this door.

470
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,130
Yan Balang, you go back on your words?

471
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,130
No, no, no.

472
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I didn't.

473
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,770
I did promise to let you go,

474
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,770
but

475
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,970
I can't control the NPCs.

476
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,090
Just enjoy yourselves

477
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
here.

478
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Let's go.

479
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,480
Give me your left leg, would you?

480
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,690
Sako.

481
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,120
It's been a long time.

482
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
Call me by my full name, Sachiko.

483
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,690
Be careful.

484
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,810
Ruan. Lingling.

485
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,050
Ice has covered the world,

486
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,030
with cold winds blowing the snow.

487
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,920
It's great that you're still here.

488
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Qianli.

489
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,970
You've become an NPC?

490
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,250
Yes.

491
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,930
But I can still feel the cold.

492
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,640
It's better than nothing.

493
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,700
I've fought against them for so long,

494
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,090
and I'm sweating.

495
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,370
You hid away and didn't come out until I took care of them.

496
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,030
Of course, you will feel cold.

497
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,170
If I hadn't informed you,

498
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,630
would you have shown your power here?

499
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,370
Qianli?

500
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,630
You asked them to come and save us?

501
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,410
Lingling,

502
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,950
let's get to the point.

503
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,810
They are all your friends.

504
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,960
You, here.

505
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,290
Like this.

506
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,160
Yes.

507
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Yes?

508
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:21,820
Okay.

509
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,660
Not bad. I think so too.

510
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,200
Anyway,

511
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,160
Ruan is just like me now,

512
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,400
an NPC.

513
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,010
But my level

514
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,400
is still much higher than yours.

515
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,070
Level is the point?

516
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
But I feel

517
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,040
we are closer.

518
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,200
Although we are not humans,

519
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,480
we are best friends.

520
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,370
We are all NPCs.

521
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Qianli.

522
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,080
You and them are best friends now?

523
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Of course.

524
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,160
Think about it.

525
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,520
A couple of days have passed inside the door,

526
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,120
as only 15 minutes have passed in the real world.

527
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,180
Months have passed in the real world.

528
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
Things have changed.

529
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,580
We've long been good sisters.

530
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,780
Speaking of which,

531
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,290
it's all thanks to Lingling's foresight.

532
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,000
Right?

533
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,010
If you hadn't formed a good relationship with all of them inside the doors,

534
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,610
we wouldn't be in such a harmonious situation.

535
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,320
I still feel uncomfortable when it gets cold.

536
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,520
All the parts are fine

537
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,100
except for my left leg. It's still a bit numb.

538
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Didn't my dad give you a folk remedy?

539
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,650
It's too bitter.

540
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,440
I didn't take it as prescribed.

541
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:29,840
You...

542
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,560
You don't take your medicine on time,

543
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,800
yet you still expect to feel better?

544
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,880
You wish.

545
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,690
Now there's a

546
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
kind of tights.

547
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Beige tights.

548
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:39,960
It's fluffy inside.

549
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,170
So, they can't see...

550
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,520
Your hair is in the way.

551
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
How about cutting it?

552
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,360
I know a stylist named Xu Jin.

553
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
She is good.

554
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's come to her together when we're free.

555
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,600
Okay.

556
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,020
Can I go with you too?

557
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,520
I always wear a hat

558
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,530
because my hairstyle is too ugly.

559
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,520
Of course. You're welcome.

560
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,800
Wu lives in seclusion.

561
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,490
Maybe she thinks that Sako and Jiu

562
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,840
are too young, so they have no common topics.

563
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,960
I didn't expect

564
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,530
that they would have a lively chat about hair.

565
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,360
This color is called "Super Violent Red."

566
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,760
I mixed the color myself.

567
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Do you like it?

568
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,520
Is there any other color?

569
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,170
I don't think red suits me.

570
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,090
I want to see other colors.

571
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,040
Let me mix some for you.

572
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay.

573
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,770
Okay.

574
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,200
Sisters, excuse me.

575
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,330
Sorry to interrupt you.

576
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,530
Do any of you have any clues to this door?

577
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,760
Not a bit?

578
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,080
We don't have it,

579
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,280
so there is no way that Yan Balang has it.

580
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Sako.

581
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,690
I have to say something.

582
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,880
You can't still think of yourself as a student.

583
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,010
We can't always compare ourselves to the last one.

584
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,290
We're second to last.

585
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,530
Plus, Yan Balang is cunning.

586
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,080
He won't sit back and do nothing.

587
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,730
Where are we going?

588
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,680
Ling Jiushi's house,

589
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,880
where he used to live.

590
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,610
You have a clue?

591
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,010
Since his friend designed this game,

592
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,290
he even left the clue, "Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror,"

593
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,970
to him.

594
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,450
The key or the door

595
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,220
must be related to him.

596
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,320
He used to share an apartment

597
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,160
with a boy named Wu Qi.
