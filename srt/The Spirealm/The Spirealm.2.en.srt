00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,350
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,920
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,550
Be careful.

4
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,670
There are monsters here.

5
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,150
It's very hungry

6
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,390
and has eaten all living creatures.

7
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,190
Why is the patriarch not enthusiastic at all?

8
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,660
He's just a NPC

9
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,810
to give you some key information.

10
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,670
This is your first time here.

11
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,440
He's probably repeated it hundreds of times.

12
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,460
There's no enthusiasm left.

13
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,330
It seems like the task is to make a coffin.

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,340
Let's go back to the village.

15
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,350
Let's go.

16
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,910
Nobody can make a coffin in this damn place.

17
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,530
It's useless to complain.

18
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,070
Learn from the rookie.

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,390
Him?

20
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,390
Our patriarch said we had to make a coffin.

21
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,450
The key must be related to the coffin.

22
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,710
What key?

23
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,030
We use keys to unlock the doors

24
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,110
when we come in

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,750
and go out.

26
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,070
We need clues offered by the door

27
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,150
to find its key.

28
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,070
Is there a time limit?

29
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,510
Yes, of course.

30
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,840
Before we are eaten up by that monster.

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,810
Let's go find that carpenter.

32
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,030
There are no living creatures

33
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,180
other than humans.

34
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,079
They were all eaten.

35
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,440
They almost ate humans.

36
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,150
There was some dirt on the female ghost.

37
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,150
Did you see that?

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,670
Are you serious?

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,610
You observed the female ghost so carefully.

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,610
I just remembered it by accident.

41
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,350
Fine. So?

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,770
So, it's snowing heavily these days.

43
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,950
There is no dry dirt on the ground.

44
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,750
I guess the female ghost's hideout

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,350
should be a cave or a burrow.

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,030
You're quite interesting.

47
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,430
But some things are not...

48
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,950
Why so suddenly?

49
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,770
What are you doing?

50
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,350
Is this well for water?

51
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,230
Go away. Don't get close to the well.

52
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,030
Does every house have a well?

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,990
I don't know.

54
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,990
Go away.

55
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,870
This uncle is as unkind as the patriarch.

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,800
Let's go to the carpenter's house.

57
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,710
Don't worry.

58
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,350
Some key clues

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,030
are obtained from these NPCs

60
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,360
who look unimpressive.

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Sir,

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,670
we are invited by the patriarch.

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,110
If you are not cooperative,

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,510
we'll be sad.

65
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,070
Are you invited by the patriarch?

66
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,230
We wouldn't have come to this isolated place

67
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,230
if we weren't doing a favor for the patriarch.

68
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,270
Our patriarch is a good man.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,910
Thanks to him, we survived.

70
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,510
Sir,

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,350
this well is not for water, isn't it?

72
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,390
There are signs of large animals attacking here.

73
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,990
It's obviously targeting something in the well.

74
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,670
It's less likely for it

75
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,190
to bite, gnaw, and drill for water.

76
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,590
Besides, there is no well rope here.

77
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,930
This is definitely not for water.

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,030
Your patriarch invited us here

79
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,830
to solve some problems.

80
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,710
If you keep being this hesitant,

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,810
we will leave you alone.

82
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,310
Gentlemen,

83
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,270
it's not that I don't want to tell you,

84
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,630
but I can't.

85
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,560
You are hiding from a wolf?

86
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
Yes.

87
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,990
I have killed it.

88
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,550
It's me who killed it.

89
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,990
What's the difference? We're friends.

90
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,990
If that's the case,

91
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,270
you two are our saviors.

92
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,670
We're flattered.

93
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,880
You just need to answer the questions we just asked.

94
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,990
Let me tell you.

95
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
This well

96
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,150
is not for water.

97
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,550
It was built

98
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,870
when the patriarch

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,470
led us to avoid the wolf disaster.

100
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,990
Those people outside the village

101
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,990
knew we encountered a wolf disaster.

102
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,270
Not only did they stand by,

103
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,480
but they said we'd be punished for the bad things we've done.

104
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,150
So the beasts were brought to exterminate us.

105
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,870
What happened in this well?

106
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,350
There is a monster!

107
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,470
A monster?

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,550
Why don't you blow it up

109
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,830
or bury it

110
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,630
so that the monster would have nowhere to hide?

111
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,420
I have thought about it.

112
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,750
There are two siblings in our village

113
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,350
who were quite bold.

114
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,650
They tried to bury their well.

115
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,200
While they were burying it,

116
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,270
they looked into the well

117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,550
and both died.

118
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,990
Who dares to bury it?

119
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,350
So I didn't do it.

120
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,510
Two siblings?

121
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,400
Okay, thank you.

122
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Excuse us.

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,010
From now on, don't be so polite to them.

124
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,960
Ask them if you have any questions.

125
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,870
What if I can't get the answers?

126
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,870
Beat them.

127
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,430
- But... - Don't be afraid.

128
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Remember,

129
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
don't tell anyone about the well.

130
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,630
Go and check it alone.

131
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,530
It's good to have more people.

132
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,310
Have I hurt you?

133
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,270
Not yet.

134
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,150
Then listen to me for now.

135
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,060
What took you so long?

136
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,920
We went around the village.

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,350
If you want to make a coffin,

138
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,750
you have to cut down trees up in the mountains.

139
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,470
We have never made a coffin.

140
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,720
How much wood do we need?

141
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,790
Three logs.

142
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,640
A big tree thick enough for one to hold.

143
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,790
Three logs.

144
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,780
No less.

145
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,550
The trunk should be straight.

146
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,750
No scars, no cracks, no insect holes.

147
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,200
It can't be hurt by thunderstorms or fire.

148
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,950
Get trees from the sunny side of the mountain,

149
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,390
not on the shady side.

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,870
Fine.

151
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,010
How long will the coffin be ready?

152
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,400
We need it urgently.

153
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,710
Sir?

154
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,550
Go chop the trees down first.

155
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,230
Cut down the trees first.

156
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,570
If you're still alive,

157
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,090
you can come and ask me.

158
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,020
Wait, sir.

159
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,750
It's freezing cold.

160
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,950
What if you die first?

161
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,430
I'm tough enough.

162
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,230
You're a tough kind of guy.

163
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,110
Don't force him if he doesn't want to tell us.

164
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,150
But I have to.

165
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,190
Forget it if we die first.

166
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,830
What if he dies first?

167
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,790
Am I right, sir?

168
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,280
What are you going to do?

169
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,230
Let me see if there are

170
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,310
scars, cracks and insect holes in your head.

171
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,200
What the hell are you doing?

172
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,390
Let me check

173
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,870
how tough your life is.

174
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,630
Three days.

175
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,790
Three days...

176
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,790
Were you a little impulsive just now?

177
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,430
There are three monsters in this door.

178
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,630
One is outside the village, one is in the well,

179
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,760
and the other is in the heart of people.

180
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,960
We need to make it quick

181
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
so that there won't be more trouble.

182
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,070
Xiong, what are we going to do next?

183
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,190
Will a duck swim?

184
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,480
Go up the mountains to chop trees down.

185
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,870
Something bad will happen

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,950
if we go up the mountain in this terrible weather.

187
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,790
That's right.

188
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,070
Can't we go there when the weather is better?

189
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,550
That's right.

190
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,230
Are you going up to the mountains?

191
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,030
Yes, we're going up the mountain to cut down trees.

192
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,070
The path is slippery, so be careful.

193
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,030
Cutting trees down is toil.

194
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,830
One or two people can't carry it.

195
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,190
The trees on the mountain are so thick.

196
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,850
We have certain techniques to carry trees here.

197
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,210
You have there people.

198
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,430
You carry the head part, you carry the middle part, and you carry the back part.

199
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,790
It will save some energy.

200
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,390
OK, thank you, madam.

201
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,390
Be careful.

202
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,610
Three people carrying the trees.

203
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,720
It's already hard to go up the mountains,

204
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,590
but we have to carry the logs down the mountain later.

205
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,430
Do we have to make the coffin?

206
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,510
If we don't,

207
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,470
we won't know what will happen next.

208
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,730
How can we find the key?

209
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,710
Yes, we have to do it well.

210
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,450
If I am the one who will die,

211
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,490
at least the coffin is beautiful.

212
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,750
Chop on the same side.

213
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,870
Use your strength downwards.

214
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,110
Chopping trees

215
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,320
you have to cut a big pit and a small one.

216
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,630
Then the tree's weight

217
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,790
will cause it to fall in the direction of the big pit.

218
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,260
It can control the direction

219
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,460
and also save effort.

220
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,070
You really are a know-it-all.

221
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,790
I also find that you don't do anything

222
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,850
that costs energy.

223
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,510
There's a saying describing people like you.

224
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,710
You can neither move your four limbs nor distinguish between the five grains.

225
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,910
You must have been the same in real life.

226
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,200
You're wrong.

227
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,590
Give me a hand.

228
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,120
I can't. I'm exhausted.

229
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,880
I can't take it anymore. My hand is broken.

230
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,550
I'm too tired to move.

231
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,110
Come on. You carry it.

232
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,630
Coming.

233
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
My wound hurts badly.

234
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,030
Jiushi, carry me down the mountain.

235
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,030
But I'm helping them.

236
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,030
There are lots of people. You don't have to be here.

237
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,030
Fine.

238
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,310
I'll carry you.

239
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,510
Be gentle.

240
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,550
Thank you.

241
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,230
Yang, one, two.

242
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,350
Be careful.

243
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,350
Yes.

244
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,350
Come on.

245
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,390
Ruan Baijie, why are you lighter?

246
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,270
Ruan Baijie?

247
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,390
It is slippery. Be careful.

248
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,390
Okay.

249
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,590
Ling Jiushi.

250
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,200
What are you doing?

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Are you leaving me alone?

252
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,510
Come on.

253
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,240
Give me the torch.

254
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,750
Be careful.

255
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,470
Come on.

256
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,670
Be careful.

257
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,320
Something happened. Let's go.

258
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,670
Why me again?

259
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,730
How could this happen?

260
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,190
Are we all going to die here?

261
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,190
Something happened to them.

262
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,490
How can we take the log back?

263
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,510
Haul it back. Don't carry it.

264
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,150
You need to get two more logs.

265
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,150
You want me to make a coffin quickly,

266
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,330
then you have to get the logs soon.

267
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,470
Let's go back.

268
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,030
Let's go.

269
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,630
Xiong.

270
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,790
What did those three do just now?

271
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,190
Why did they trigger the taboo conditions?

272
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,750
Cutting trees down and carrying wood,

273
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,590
or going out on a snowy day.

274
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,270
How do we verify that?

275
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,920
Why do we have to verify?

276
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,810
Just avoid these conditions.

277
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,230
Alright.

278
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,070
Let's go back.

279
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,990
Let's go.

280
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,070
What's wrong?

281
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,870
Nothing.

282
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,030
Let's go.

283
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,670
Three of you are missing.

284
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,230
Actually, we have rules for entering the mountains here.

285
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,430
We must worship the Goddess of Mountains.

286
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,070
But you are outsiders.

287
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,790
I'm afraid you might think I'm nagging,

288
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,150
so I didn't tell you.

289
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,780
I should have...

290
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,350
We'd rather believe what we're told.

291
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,830
Worship the Goddess of Mountains after dinner.

292
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,230
Are you going to worship?

293
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,070
I'll tell you more then.

294
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,190
You must follow the rules

295
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,290
and worship her inside one by one.

296
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,760
Why do we have to go in one by one?

297
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,550
This is the rule

298
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,080
inherited from the elders.

299
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,740
Maybe they thought people looked more sincere when they went in one by one.

300
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,750
But no matter what happens,

301
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,270
you must remember

302
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,390
to worship one by one inside.

303
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,150
Or,

304
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,030
more than three people will die.

305
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,589
I'll go first.

306
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,950
I'll go first.

307
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,670
I'll be the second.

308
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,710
I'll go first.

309
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,590
It's not safe inside.

310
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,070
It's strange to be safe here.

311
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,950
I mean

312
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,050
it's dangerous to go in alone.

313
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,030
Then tell me what to do.

314
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,430
How about this?

315
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,070
Let's go in together.

316
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,390
If you want to go in, find someone to accompany you.

317
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,950
We were told to go in one by one.

318
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,590
If we don't follow the customs...

319
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,430
Are you trying to get us all killed?

320
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,750
Fine, it's up to you.

321
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,030
Don't look at me like that.

322
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,030
I'm not a ghost.

323
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,150
Xiong, it seems to be fine for them.

324
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,710
Who knows?

325
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,430
Didn't you say

326
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,510
it's a person when you go in,

327
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,470
but it's hard to tell what you are when you come out?

328
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,030
I worked so hard to make money

329
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,430
to marry a girl.

330
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,950
I-I don't want to die.

331
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,190
I...

332
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,990
So,

333
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,910
I won't change the requirements of NPCs.

334
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,670
I won't change.

335
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,060
I won't.

336
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,510
Don't follow me.

337
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Don't come in.

338
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,550
Let's go in together.

339
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,990
Aren't you afraid...

340
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,350
Let's be together even if we will die.

341
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,120
Didn't the landlady say

342
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,480
someone would die if we didn't go in and worship?

343
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,750
Let's go.

344
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,110
Jiushi.

345
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,070
What did you see inside?

346
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,590
Just an ordinary statue.

347
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,590
Don't you think that statue is strange?

348
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,270
I've never seen a statue like that before.

349
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,350
How about we go together?

350
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,750
What did you see inside?

351
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,270
I... I think

352
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,470
I saw a female ghost in white again.

353
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,030
She looked at me and moved.

354
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,230
Bless me.

355
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,230
Goddess of Mountains, bless us!

356
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,760
Goddess of Mountains, Goddess of Mountains!

357
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,590
Goddess of Mountains, bless me!

358
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,790
Goddess of Mountains, please bless me.

359
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,270
I'm sincere.

360
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,070
Goddess of Mountains, please bless me.

361
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,190
Goddess of Mountains, bless me!

362
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,590
Goddess of Mountains...

363
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,990
What we saw is quite different.

364
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,740
- Bless us to be safe. - Amitabha.

365
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,370
Keep us safe and sound.

366
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,430
Don't let me die.

367
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,750
No way.

368
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,270
No way.

369
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,470
No way.

370
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,350
Going one by one is devout.

371
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,840
You're the ones who made a mistake.

372
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,990
It must be your fault.

373
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,270
Baijie.

374
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,310
No way.

375
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,670
Save me!

376
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,830
It's too late.

377
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,200
Why is it always me?

378
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,230
She's gone.

379
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,110
So, does that mean we'll survive?

380
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,850
What about the people who got caught?

381
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,870
We went to the temple

382
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,260
to pray for our lives,

383
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,240
but it turned into a sacrifice.

384
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,790
I think

385
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,730
someone knows the rules inside the door.

386
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,160
Just speak frankly.

387
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,030
If you don't follow the rules to enter the temple,

388
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,290
how can you know someone will die before anything happens.

389
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,750
If he wanted to hide something,

390
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,210
there's no need to warn us.

391
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,270
If he wanted to do someone a favor, he didn't need to go.

392
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,330
Don't be in a hurry to speak up for him.

393
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,510
The order in which everyone entered may be different,

394
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,070
and you might be in the dark too,

395
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,530
and just a pawn in his game.

396
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,320
Judging from your tone,

397
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,720
you seem to be experienced too.

398
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,710
If I were all-knowing,

399
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,550
I would have used the key to pass through and left long ago,

400
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,590
rather than wasting time talking to you here.

401
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,430
But you two...

402
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,560
Who are "you two"?

403
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
You and Ke.

404
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,950
You both are in harmony,

405
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,790
what's your purpose?

406
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,790
You two just met and can be partners,

407
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,120
why can't we form a team?

408
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,830
We met outside the door,

409
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,110
is there something wrong with taking care of each other inside?

410
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,370
Who said you're wrong?

411
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,550
I'm just asking,

412
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,440
what are you guilty of?

413
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,630
Are you referring to guilt when answering questions

414
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,430
or guilt when putting on labels?

415
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,000
Instead of speculating about others,

416
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,920
you'd better to think about

417
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,920
how to take care of yourself first.

418
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,520
What are you talking about?

419
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,310
Sit down.

420
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,910
Why have you become so assertive?

421
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,280
The situation has changed,

422
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,030
we need to state our position first.

423
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,560
Has the situation changed?

424
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,190
The monster has already eaten 6 people.

425
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,920
Perhaps she's full, or maybe she's still hungry.

426
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,070
We worked together before,

427
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,110
but now, we're all hoping the other person dies first.

428
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,710
We must be cautious and have a sense of precaution.

429
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,710
We?

430
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,910
You and I.

431
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,390
Fool.

432
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,790
Thanks, brother.

433
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,710
Maybe if 1 more person dies, the monster will be full.

434
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,150
If 1 person dies, it might save everyone.

435
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,170
Whom do you choose?

436
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,870
I don't know.

437
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,830
I...

438
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,750
I can't decide.

439
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,350
If 1 person dies, it might save everyone.

440
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,090
Whom do you choose?

441
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,750
I... I don't know how to choose.

442
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm the one being chosen.

443
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,670
Save me! Open the door!

444
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,880
Cheng Wen wants to kill me!

445
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,910
Open the door! Save me, I'm begging you.

446
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,150
I don't want to die!

447
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,190
Open the door!

448
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,070
Cheng Wen wants to kill me! Open the door! He wants to kill me!

449
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,070
Open the door!

450
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,230
Ling Jiushi is not human,

451
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,310
don't be deceived by her.

452
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,070
Open the door!

453
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,590
It's the middle of the night. Are you going to prevent anyone from sleeping?

454
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,950
Please save me,

455
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,290
I don't want to die.

456
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,550
Get lost!

457
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,360
Don't disturb my sleep.

458
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,430
It's OK,

459
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,230
he's gone.

460
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,080
You can sleep here tonight.

461
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,430
OK.

462
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,030
I was woken up in the middle of the night,

463
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,310
and now I can't feel sleepy anymore.

464
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,150
Was that female monster

465
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,610
pointing at that window all the time last night?

466
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,630
You're injured. Let me bandage it for you.

467
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,630
Thank you.

468
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,710
Straighten your arm.

469
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,230
Thank you.

470
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,310
It's nothing.

471
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,510
Ruan Baijie.

472
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,430
Where is he?

473
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,310
You're enjoying the snow on such a late night.

474
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,070
Stay away from me.

475
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,940
What do you mean?

476
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,200
Don't come any closer.

477
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
Just wait for me.

478
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,950
Hold on.

479
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,070
Ruan Baijie, hold on!

480
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,110
I'll throw it down, and then you run.

481
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,770
Don't come near me. Don't look at the well by two.

482
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,710
Thank you.

483
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,030
It's nothing.

484
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,710
Are you okay?

485
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,950
By the way, I found the door.

486
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,510
It's right below.

487
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,230
Great.

488
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,250
Once we find the key, we can leave.

489
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,350
Yes.

490
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,330
After all, it's a low-level door,

491
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,950
so it won't be too difficult.

492
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,510
What did you mean by

493
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,670
"Don't look at the well by two" just now?

494
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,190
It's similar with "Don't enter the temple alone.".

495
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,310
"Don't look at the well by two."

496
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,310
is a proverb.

497
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,360
Another proverb? There are so many proverbs.

498
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,440
As a token of gratitude,

499
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,920
I have a gift for you.

500
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,110
What is this?

501
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,030
I wanted to give it to you outside.

502
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,710
Take it.

503
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Outside?

504
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,390
It's very important. Take it.

505
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,270
Ok, thank you.

506
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Put it on.

507
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,360
It's too big and a bit uncomfortable around the neck.

508
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,230
Thanks.

509
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,710
Morning.

510
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,430
- Morning. - Morning, Xiong.

511
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,210
You guys are going up the mountain today, right?

512
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,350
Yes.

513
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,610
We need two more trees.

514
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,630
That's good.

515
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,110
You 6 can split into 2 groups.

516
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,670
Three people carry 1 tree.

517
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,430
You'll be done in a day.

518
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,750
That makes sense.

519
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,730
You guys have all worshiped the spirits,

520
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,360
nothing should go wrong.

521
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,910
Three people.

522
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,640
It took so long to chop down.

523
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,950
You didn't help, that's fine,

524
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,750
but why make sarcastic remarks?

525
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,400
I wanted to help too.

526
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,970
but I got injured trying to save someone.

527
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,470
Oh no.

528
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,310
What's wrong?

529
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,070
Sarcastic remarks are what make people most sober.

530
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,160
Alright, both trees are ready.

531
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,130
Let's tie the ropes

532
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,290
and drag them back.

533
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,630
Who's going to drag them?

534
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,770
Let's split into 2 groups and everyone can drag.

535
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,710
Good idea.

536
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,680
We all do the same thing.

537
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,350
Whoever gets into trouble is just unlucky.

538
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,310
Let me help you.

539
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Here.

540
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,590
Let me help you.

541
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,590
Don't come over.

542
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,510
We can do it.

543
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Put more effort.

544
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,230
For the train to run fast,

545
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,310
it must have a powerful engine.

546
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,870
I can't carry it anymore.

547
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,390
Why didn't you ask Wang Xiaoyi for help?

548
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,560
Haven't you heard the proverb?

549
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,230
Don't hold the tree by three.

550
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,590
Another proverb.

551
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
It's so heavy.

552
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,910
I know you're not human.

553
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,510
Wang Xiaoyi,

554
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,790
I'll kill you today.

555
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,870
Calm down.

556
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,070
Move aside.

557
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,810
If you don't, I'll chop you up along with her.

558
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,910
Are you crazy?

559
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,900
Huh?

560
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,110
Wait.

561
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,910
Wang Xiaoyi is already dead.

562
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,990
She's not human.

563
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,430
If you don't believe, take a look.

564
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,760
Her body is right there.

565
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,100
I... I haven't died. I'm human.

566
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Shut up!

567
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,910
Look back.

568
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,940
That's just a piece of stone.

569
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,230
I...

570
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,030
I saw it clearly just now.

571
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,510
If you cause trouble again, don't blame me for being impolite.

572
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,570
Hurry up, let's go.

573
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,410
Are you okay?

574
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,470
I'm fine.

575
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,470
The female monster didn't kill anyone.

576
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,110
Does that mean we didn't violate any taboo conditions today?

577
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,110
Not necessarily.

578
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,400
She is obviously intelligent.

579
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,950
If I were her,

580
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,470
I wouldn't kill anyone for these three days.

581
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,180
Maybe I wouldn't even need to do it myself.

582
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,150
Got it.

583
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,230
Cheng Wen is already mad,

584
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,150
and there might be more people like Cheng Wen after that.

585
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Yes.

586
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,150
Let's go.

587
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,150
Put more effort into it, Old Bro.

588
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,590
I'm doing my best.

589
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,510
Old man.

590
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,760
We've brought the wood.

591
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,310
We have 1 day left.

592
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,760
Can the coffin be ready?

593
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,070
I said 3 days means 3 days.

594
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,120
One more day is not acceptable, and 1 day less is not acceptable either.

595
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,639
The day after tomorrow.

596
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,550
You can come and take it the day after tomorrow.

597
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,610
Don't always think about the coffin.

598
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,110
She's not full yet.

599
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,070
If you all get eaten by her,

600
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,989
the coffin would be unnecessary.

601
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,710
She might not necessarily eat living things.

602
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,969
she can also consume non-living things.

603
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,870
That's right.

604
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,350
As long as you let her eat until she's full,

605
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,350
anything will do.

606
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,670
But if you encounter her

607
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,710
and don't let her eat enough,

608
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,230
you won't be able to escape.

609
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,510
You've hidden the axe.

610
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,970
I wanted to ask you something.

611
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,750
I have.

612
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,710
You...

613
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,370
What do you want to ask?

614
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,310
I don't want to guess and don't want to wait either.

615
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,350
I just want to know

616
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,910
if the key is in the coffin.

617
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,190
Yes.

618
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,150
Thank you.

619
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,770
What's wrong with you?

620
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,030
Nothing.

621
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,030
Let's go.

622
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,510
Shameless!

623
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,150
You only know how to target women.

624
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,150
She's not human at all.

625
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,150
Are you a human?

626
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,870
If you're really capable,

627
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,870
try attacking me

628
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,150
or Xiong Qi,

629
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,510
only attacking women,

630
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,750
what kind of man are you?

631
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,210
There's a well over there.

632
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,270
We were hiding inside when the wolves came.

633
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,930
You go in first and take cover.

634
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,990
You're truly insane.

635
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,670
What's happening with you guys?

636
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,830
Please don't kill me.

637
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,950
I'm really a human.

638
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,110
You must die today.

639
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,030
Don't look!

640
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,950
It's useless.

641
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,150
I want to be alone.

642
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,960
You go up and rest first.

643
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,400
Do you think

644
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,020
I'm particularly cold-blooded and heartless?

645
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,310
At a time like this,

646
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,340
I can still eat.

647
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,000
I just watched someone die without helping and even stopped you to offer help.

648
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,530
Do you think I'm even worse than pigs and dogs?

649
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,440
It's okay for you to think that way.

650
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,950
Do you know

651
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,470
how many people I've saved over the years?

652
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,010
Not to mention you,

653
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,110
I myself don't even know.

654
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,590
Some of these people

655
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,630
are scammers,

656
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,310
some stabbed me in the back,

657
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,470
and some aren't even human.

658
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,030
I won't be cheated.

659
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,120
And I know when I should...

660
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,550
How come you speak so harshly

661
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,910
like Ruan Baijie?

662
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Ling Jiushi, you're kind-hearted.

663
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,770
But can you save everyone?

664
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,950
Do you know how many people die every day

665
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,030
in this world?

666
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,190
I can't save them all.

667
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,030
I just want to leave this cursed place as soon as possible.

668
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,400
I can't save everyone,

669
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,470
but I only want to save the people in front of me.

670
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,750
Fine.

671
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,430
But I hope

672
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,110
you can still think like this after going through hardships.

673
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,910
Don't end up like me,

674
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,520
just becoming an ordinary person.

675
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,910
There are good and bad ordinary people.

676
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,070
Okay.

677
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,430
Hero also needs to eat

678
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,630
and sleep.

679
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,710
Finish this drink

680
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,550
and go back for an early rest.
