(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,039
(Episode 31)

3
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,030
Dear guests, please calm down and relax.

4
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,630
Let's give Miss Tan Zaozao some more time.

5
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,479
I believe that today Miss Tan Zaozao

6
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,229
will present a flawless image,

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,270
and deliver a flawless speech. Alright?

8
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,270
She's not in there?

9
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,350
I can't find Zaozao.

10
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,750
I don't know where she is.

11
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,509
Lingling!

12
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,070
Zaozao?

13
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,710
You're here.

14
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,830
This is great.

15
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,110
I'm so glad that you're fine.

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,430
There are 3 minutes left. We can make it.

17
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,030
Give me your employee badge.

18
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,750
Hold my arm. Let's go.

19
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,550
Here comes Zaozao!

20
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,550
Is she here?

21
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,110
Let's go.

22
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,350
Be careful.

23
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,720
You've got this.

24
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,180
Didn't your assistant say

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,590
you were fixing your make-up?

26
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,790
What? Is this the best you could do?

27
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,670
Yes.

28
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,440
You're looking at the result of my efforts to fix my make-up.

29
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,460
In many occasions,

30
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,870
hard work doesn't necessarily produce good results.

31
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,460
It's true when I fixed my make-up.

32
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,390
It's also true when it comes to my acting skills.

33
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,790
I've worked really hard.

34
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,550
But all I can get in the end is

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,010
just this award, isn't it?

36
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,790
Well, next,

37
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,950
the trophy will be brought to the stage.

38
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,470
Now the floor is Miss Tan Zaozao's.

39
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,790
She'll be giving an acceptance speech.

40
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Hello, everyone.

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,270
My name is Tan Zaozao.

42
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,630
Sometimes,

43
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,560
people call me "eye candy,"

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,930
"the lousiest actress ever,"

45
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,030
or just "an ugly girl."

46
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,829
Are those people here today?

47
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,870
Now,

48
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,430
thanks to this award,

49
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,610
I finally have a chance to talk to you.

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,590
In my 10 years as an actress,

51
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,110
this is the first award I've won.

52
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,230
Perhaps

53
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,430
this is the very last award I'll win.

54
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,360
(The 7th Golden Jujube Award Ceremony)

55
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,149
In my 10 years as an actress,

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,070
I've been endeavoring

57
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,670
to play the role of Tan Zaozao.

58
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,630
She is cold,

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
sophisticated,

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,159
and dignified like a queen.

61
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,290
I play whatever character

62
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,550
is trendy.

63
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,750
I behave whatever way

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,750
that people like.

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,430
But honestly,

66
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,510
I dislike all that stuff.

67
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,950
These

68
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,770
are the personas designed by my company.

69
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,530
Over the past 10 years,

70
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,840
I've never been the real me.

71
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,310
I wouldn't have the guts to go out without make-up,

72
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,310
to curse,

73
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,230
or to tell people

74
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,710
that art isn't the only reason I work as an actress.

75
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,240
I do it for money too.

76
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,360
Life is like a drama.

77
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,830
It somewhat resembles a game, or a dream.

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,550
How to play my role well

79
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,000
is a puzzle I've never been able to solve.

80
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,310
I'm confused and fuzzy,

81
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,230
as time flies.

82
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,600
I feel like I'm in the middle

83
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,070
of a game,

84
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,550
where I'm suddenly told the outcome of my efforts.

85
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,960
This game I've been playing

86
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430
has brought me regrets,

87
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,310
and surprises.

88
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,260
♫About to disappear♫

89
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,360
But I don't regret being part of it.

90
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,070
Exactly because

91
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,480
of playing the role of Tan Zaozao,

92
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,780
I have got what I own today,

93
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,730
and had a chance to stand here.

94
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,270
So,

95
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,070
I'm grateful for this award.

96
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,150
The Golden Jujube.

97
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,070
It's so bitter,

98
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,390
but

99
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,350
also so real.

100
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,430
It

101
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,310
reminds me of

102
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,320
the many regrets I've had in my life.

103
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,070
Regrets are exactly

104
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,790
what our lives are built on.

105
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,190
Thank you, everyone.

106
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,830
I hope

107
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,910
your lives

108
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,830
will consist of

109
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,360
less regrets,

110
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,340

(10 minutes ago)

125
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,440
She's not in there?

126
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,590
I can't find Zaozao.

127
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,990
I don't know where she is.

128
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
Lingling!

129
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,630
Zaozao?

130
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,120
You're here.

131
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,270
This is great.

132

Zaozao!

133
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,870
Slowly.

134
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,430
Lingling,

135
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,310
I've let you down.

136
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,870
I failed...

137
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,670
the challenge...

138
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,750
It's okay.

139
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,110
It's fine. I'm here for you.

140
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,640
It's all fine. I'm here now.

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,190
how's my performance today?

143
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,790
Brilliant. It's brilliant.

I need help here!

149
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,070
Help!

Hang in there.

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,330
I'll call a doctor for you.

Hello, doctor?

158
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,190
Get me some help!

159
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,270
Hello, doctor?

160
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,390
A girl is dying!

161
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,390
A girl is dying!

162
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,750
Send someone here!

163
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,070
Zaozao,

164
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,110
hang in there. Help's on the way.

165
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,190
Hang in there!

166
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,510
Hang in there.

167
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,130
Why did you turn it off?

168
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,010
We'd better not let him see it.

169
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,330
When you miss someone,

170
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,150
shouldn't you watch her videos more often?

171
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,630
Then go back to your room,

172
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,710
and watch them alone.

173
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,530
It's been several days.

174
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,450
Is Lingling gonna be alright?

175
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,530
I'll take good care of him.

176
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,510
Hello, Ruan.

177
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,790
Is Lingling here?

178
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,550
I'm Ran.

179
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,070
When I was packing...

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,180
(Lingling) (Ruan)

181
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,800
When I was packing Miss Zaozao's belongings,

182
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,070
I found a box

183
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,430
with your names written on it.

184
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,710
So I brought it here on her behalf.

185
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,710
Leave it to me.

186
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,110
Sorry to bother you. I should get going now.

187
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,240
It's left by Zaozao.

188
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
Ruan, Lingling.

189
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,470
Guess who I am,

190
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,600
Tan Zaozao or Xu Xiaocheng?

191
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,270
Alright.

192
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,760
Joking time is over.

193
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,030
When you two see this video,

194
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,410
I will definitely be gone.

195
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,440
But no matter where I am,

196
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,430
I'll miss you.

197
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,270
So,

198
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,790
be happy

199
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,920
when you see this video.

200
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,750
Lingling,

201
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,150
will you become dispirited

202
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,310
by my death?

203
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,950
This is not what

204
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,520
I want to see as your friend.

205
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,350
I'm sure Ruan won't be so.

206
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,030
He's the most rational person

207
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,190
I've ever met.

208
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,390
In fact,

209
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,710
for me,

210
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,350
it is a real relief.

211
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,850
I don't have to worry about

212
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,070
the disturbing events in the door anymore.

213
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,750
I recorded the video

214
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,440
for a simple reason.

215
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,480
In a few days,

216
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,200
I'll enter the door.

217
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,970
I don't know if I can get out this time.

218
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,950
If I can,

219
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,240
I'll record a new one for you

220
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,710
before I enter the next door.

221
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,830
Because I hope

222
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,590
that in your memory,

223
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,610
your last impression of me

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,310
isn't my dead face,

225
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,710
but my smile.

226
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,590
By the way, Lingling,

227
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
the bracelet

228
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,630
is my heirloom.

229
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,070
I think

230
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,390
you will live longer than me.

231
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,510
So,

232
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,950
pass it on,

233
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,150
and pass my hope on.

234
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,250
I hope you are well.

235
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,990
Ruan,

236
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
I miss you too.

237
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,510
Even if

238
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,070
you always act in a cold-blooded manner,

239
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,150
and lecture and tease me,

240
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,310
I know

241
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,790
it's for my good.

242
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,900
When I was a kid,

243
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,910
I liked playing games too,

244
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,790
such as rubber band skipping

245
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,730
and hiding the handkerchief.

246
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,190
When I was growing up,

247
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,410
I liked Super Mario and

248
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,550
Contra.

249
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,670
I think these games

250
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,710
tell us

251
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,720
to be kind

252
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,370
and save the world.

253
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,750
Why are we playing such an evil game now?

254
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,440
I don't understand.

255
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm not that smart enough to figure it out.

256
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,430
So this time,

257
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,750
I'll break my words.

258
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,390
Bye.

259
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Luckily,

260
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,710
I met you two

261
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,830
in this game.

262
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,470
As long as I know you're well,

263
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,310
I'm happy.

264
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,630
I can't play the game anymore.

265
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,670
Please take care of yourselves.

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Alright,

267
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,390
it's time to say goodbye.

268
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,070
Please

269
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,630
remember

270
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,390
my smiling face.

271
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,109
If we can meet again,

272
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,710
let me try to protect you.

273
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,060
♫I'm afraid I'll do anything♫

274
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,220
♫I won't give up♫

275
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:40,310
♫Want to return to the end of the world♫

276
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,290
♫You will be♫

277
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,410
♫Behind me♫

278
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,730
♫I know♫

279
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,780
♫From afar♫

280
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,130
♫Looking me♫

281
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
♫In the eye♫

282
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,810
♫Will we♫

283
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,840
♫Meet again♫

284
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,250
♫In some other time and space♫

285
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,970
♫To have you in my arms♫

286
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,350
I'll cook

287
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,160
and send him food upstairs.

288
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
No need.

289
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,000
He will go downstairs himself.

290
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,870
Lingling.

291
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110
Are you okay?

292
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,670
Yes.

293
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,630
I'm a strong man now.

294
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,390
Have you come round to the idea?

295
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,390
Yes.

296
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,110
You're right.

297
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,260
I should live well for my friends,

298
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,390
because I bear their hope.

299
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,430
I'm starving.

300
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,470
I'll cook.

301
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,590
You two help me.

302
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,430
Hurry up.

303
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,510
Coming.

304
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,340
Open the fridge.

305
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,110
Take out what you want to eat today.

306
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,770
I'll make you delicious food.

307
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,270
Look.

308
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,640
Why is there no meat?

309
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,510
Take out the vegetables first. Wash them.

310
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,790
Do you know how to cook meat?

311
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,990
Wash the vegetables.

312
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,680
Why does Yi Manman always not buy meat?

313
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,610
He likes to buy snacks.

314
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,230
Do you think you're a chef?

315
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,790
Your cooking skill is worse than Lingling.

316
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,820
I won't cook anyway.

317
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,310
Come and wash the vegetables.

318
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,310
Get a basin and wash the vegetables.

319
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,720
(Before the Golden Jujube Award Ceremony)

320
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,660
Ruan, why are you here?

321
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,200
I will help you pass the door this time.

322
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,230
But didn't you say...

323
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,270
You are my friend.

324
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,810
I'm willing to make an exception for you.

325
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,200
(To Ruan)

326
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,190
Ruan.

327
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,670
Ruan.

328
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,930
Zaozao is missing.

329
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,470
I found the letter she left for you.

330
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,380
So I give it to you now.

331
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,630
I have to look for her.

332
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,990
Thank you.

333
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,270
Ruan,

334
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
in the end, I decided to pass the door by myself.

335
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,710
I'm brave, right?

336
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,910
Actually, I'm scared.

337
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,310
But I decided

338
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,630
to face it myself.

339
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,190
Thank you, Ruan.

340
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,710
You're willing to risk your life

341
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,510
for a coward like me, who was scared of a door-passing grind.

342
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,750
But I don't want my friends

343
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,930
to have an accident because of me.

344
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,510
Ruan,

345
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,990
you may look cold,

346
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,470
but your heart is as hot as fire.

347
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,510
Luckily, I met you

348
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,910
in this game.

349
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,910
The key is not with those people.

350
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,590
You got the wrong person.

351
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,690
Do you drink water for social phobia?

352
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,080
Why did you come in to do a door-passing grind?

353
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,430
The tenth door will open.

354
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,800
I need to get some props.

355
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,550
Why are you here alone?

356
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,320
Who else could I be with?

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,660
Ling Jishi and others.

358
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,830
I don't want to.

359
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,520
Why did you save me?

360
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,310
You got me.

361
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,430
Didn't we work together before?

362
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,210
I thought we were friends.

363
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
And

364
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,390
Xiong and you

365
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,360
are friends too, right?

366
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,080
Xiong Qi is at the Obsidian.

367
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,910
He fell out with your team a few days ago.

368
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,310
He's fine.

369
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,370
I was wondering

370
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,270
why he hadn't come to pass the door for so long time.

371
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,790
When you get out,

372
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,710
please help me report my safety.

373
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,910
Okay.

374
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,460
Though I can't get out,

375
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,700
it feels good

376
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,350
that I can often meet you guys in the future.

377
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,390
I hope you can enter the doors together next time,

378
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,720
and I can meet you again.

379
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,320
I've been alone lately.

380
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,670
What's up?

381
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,840
Did you have a fight?

382
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,430
No.

383
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm used to my way.

384
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,270
It will be more and more difficult to pass the later doors.

385
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,790
There will be more accidents like today.

386
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
Don't try to be a hero.

387
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,050
Humans are not wolves.

388
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,470
We need friends.

389
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,950
Don't be like me and Xiong Qi.

390
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,800
We didn't realize to cherish each other until we separated.

391
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,830
Two leave, one returns.

392
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Hold on.

393
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,870
Come in.

394
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,030
Ruan, what's the matter?

395
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,320
I want to tell you about the affairs

396
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
of the Obsidian.

397
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,270
Why you're so serious?

398
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,470
It's still a long time before you enter

399
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,870
the next door, isn't it?

400
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,480
In fact, in the Flowers in water,

401
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,390
that kaleidoscope,

402
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,470
I found a note,

403
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,720
which is exactly the same as the one I got

404
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
when I passed the tenth door.

405
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm not sure what's going on.

406
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,910
So I have to enter the tenth door again.

407
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,120
In theory, there wouldn't be such a coincidence.

408
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,630
Then why did you hide it from Ling Jiushi?

409
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,290
I didn't just hide it from him.

410
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,160
Before it's confirmed,

411
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,190
you should help me hide it from everyone.

412
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,990
The higher the level of the door, the more dangerous it is.

413
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,050
We should come to a conclusion after finding evidence.

414
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,190
My wrist is too thick.

415
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
I can't wear it.

416
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,510
Try it.

417
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,430
It's suitable.

418
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
Keep it.

419
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,870
It's good.

420
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,990
It's a souvenir.

421
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,910
I'll keep it safe.

422
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,000
What can I do for you?

423
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,270
I want you

424
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,450
to pass the tenth door with me.

425
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,690
Didn't you pass it before?

426
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,950
There's something wrong with the note.

427
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,550
I want to enter the door again

428
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
to verify.

429
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,270
There's something wrong with the note?

430
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,110
I remember you tried to

431
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,510
make a deal to get the note

432
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,910
of the tenth door.

433
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,470
It's too harsh. It failed.

434
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,360
So are we opening the mystery box?

435
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,910
I remember

436
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,310
Yixie has a similar note.

437
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,230
He doesn't want to pass the door with us.

438
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,590
How about

439
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,710
letting me persuade him?

440
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,800
He won't listen to anyone's words.

441
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,360
Let me give it a try.

442
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,750
If I make it,

443
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
call me Dad.

444
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,070
Whatever.

445
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,870
Yixie.

446
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,630
Are you hurt?

447
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,540
Did you do a door-passing grind? Are you okay?

448
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,540
I'm fine.

449
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,070
Well,

450
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,730
I want to discuss something with you.

451
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,750
Well,

452
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,670
I want to

453
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,390
pass the tenth door with you.

454
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,790
What a coincidence.

455
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,270
Call me Dad.

456
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,350
Bro,

457
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,310
I told you.

458
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,400
We should enter the door together.

459
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,310
Call me Dad.

460
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,510
Does your throat hurt, Lingling?

461
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,590
Yixei,

462
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,150
this is your door.

463
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,910
The clue you got

464
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,690
is about the Box Demon?

465
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:56,990
Box Demon

466
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,950
is a table game with a horror theme.

467
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,710
Players act as passers-by

468
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,720
who accidentally entered the house of the Box Demon.

469
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,560
This house is full of boxes.

470
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,190
To escape from the house,

471
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,630
players have to open a box at every step

472
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,750
to move on.

473
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,470
There may be props

474
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,190
or the Box Demon in the boxes.

475
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,870
The prototype of the Box Demon is a fox named Lady Hu.

476
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,870
She was jealous

477
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,310
and good at bewitching men.

478
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,870
She was hunted by a demon hunter,

479
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,950
who divided her body into several pieces

480
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,950
and sealed them in different boxes.

481
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,990
The Box Demon can't move freely.

482
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,270
She needs players

483
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,880
to find all parts of her body.

484
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,230
Each part has different functions.

485
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,060
After combining them together, the Box Demon will resurrect.

486
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,790
Once the Box Demon's hair is found,

487
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,310
the player will die.

488
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,030
The dead one

489
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,930
will become a Box Slave

490
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,790
and will be ordered by the Box Demon.

491
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,910
The player who finds the Box Slave will also die.

492
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,590
There are two winning methods.

493
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,670
One is using props to kill the Box Demon.

494
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,190
The other is to find the password for the safe,

495
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,250
taking out the key,

496
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,190
and leaving from the tunnel.

497
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,230
This game depends on luck to a great extent.

498
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,460
So we will play this game

499
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,790
in the door, right?

500
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,600
The rules in the door

501
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,390
may change.

502
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,530
Do you understand what I said?

503
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,390
It's okay as long as you understand.

504
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,150
The tenth door

505
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,870
is extremely dangerous.

506
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,370
So before entering it,

507
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,950
you must get familiar with the rules.

508
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,950
The next task

509
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,730
is to play this game every day.

510
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,630
I'll start now.

511
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,000
I caught the Box Demon.

512
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,890
You're a Box Slave now!

513
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,190
Alas.

514
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,070
It's too hard.

515
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,510
It's empty.

516
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,770
(Scissors)

517
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,790
Scissors can stop the Box Demon from killing at once.

518
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,790
You're lucky.

519
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,750
It seems

520
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,830
that the beginning stage of the game depends on luck

521
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,150
and then on courage.

522
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,990
This is too hard.

523
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,190
Luck and courage.

524
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,730
We have to play even so.

525
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,150
The tenth door

526
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,550
is the highest level door

527
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,270
which is known to have been passed.

528
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,200
But the game would avoid checkmate at the beginning.

529
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,150
Qianli.

530
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,480
You have to remember

531
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,990
the two ways to get out alive.

532
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,390
First,

533
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,550
kill the Box Demon with props.

534
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,790
Second,

535
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,570
find the door or open the passage of the door.

536
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,350
Where is the key?

537
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,860
The key will be hidden in a floor clock.

538
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,750
It needs a password to unlock it.

539
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,550
The door or the passage to open the door

540
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,750
are hidden in the boxes.

541
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,590
We have to open the boxes to get it.

542
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,830
Open the boxes?

543
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,960
It also depends on luck.

544
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,430
Is there any way

545
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,590
to use our strength,

546
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,590
not luck,

547
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,830
to kill the Box Demon?

548
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,550
Yes.

549
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,790
Find the prop, a coffin nail.

550
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,510
Then you can kill the Box Demon.

551
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,910
Where is the coffin nail?

552
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,190
You have to open the boxes to get it. Qianli.

553
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,590
Gosh.

554
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,190
This is so difficult.

555
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,790
Then, work harder.

556
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,070
From now on,

557
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,190
recite the rules every day.

558
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,710
Or you have no food to eat.

559
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,990
No.

560
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,590
I...

561
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,910
Don't starve me to death

562
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,240
before I enter the door.

563
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,510
I found

564
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,550
there is a big loophole in this game.

565
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,110
What is it?

566
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,310
If a stupid teammate

567
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,470
who doesn't know anything and opens the box casually,

568
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,960
we're doomed.

569
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,670
Are you

570
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,630
talking about...

571
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,590
He's talking about you.

572
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,150
My brother is a stupid teammate.

573
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,190
Your brother is the stupid one.

574
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,520
Your brother is a goose.

575
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,350
Now I understand.

576
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,870
This game is not to be played blindly.

577
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,000
If we play it blindly

578
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,790
it will be more difficult to open a box and find a Box Slave.

579
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,470
And if we unpack all the skills of the Box Demon,

580
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,590
we will lose.

581
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,790
What?

582
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,070
I'm impressed.

583
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,310
It has been a month already,

584
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,770
and now you've finally understood the rules

585
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,710
that you should have grasped on the first day.

586
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,150
I've understood them for a long time, you know?

587
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,910
I'm just helping you get familiar with them

588
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,240
so that you can remember them thoroughly.

589
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,350
I'd be grateful if you could remember them on your own.

590
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,670
Don't worry.

591
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,080
Who can't remember such simple rules?

592
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,150
Inside the door,

593
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,430
if I don't tell you to open the box,

594
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,150
you absolutely must not open the box,

595
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,950
do you hear me?

596
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,110
Yes.

597
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,710
The Box Demon is also restricted.

598
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,570
She can only use skills once a day.

599
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,110
Every time before she uses a skill,

600
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,570
she always rotates the compass in the house.

601
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,160
Ling Jiushi has good hearing.

602
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,680
He will be responsible for listening to the sounds of the compass.

603
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,470
There's one more thing to pay special attention to.

604
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,530
The X organization

605
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,790
will definitely send someone to enter the door.

606
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,790
Yes.

607
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,430
Who is it?

608
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,310
It's Bai Ming.

609
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,390
She wants the note

610
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,830
to use it to take Zhang Yiqing to pass the door.

611
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,830
I'll get the door.

612
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,350
Come in, please.

613
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,070
Long time no see.

614
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,560
Let's talk upstairs.

615
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,510
Are you all ready?

616
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,870
All of us have already become familiar with the rules of the Box Demon.

617
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,870
For this door,

618
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,080
we have a 70% chance of passing.

619
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,750
I don't want it to be 70%.

620
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,390
I want it to be 100%.

621
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,250
Then I'll bring in some more rookies,

622
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,190
and let them be the cannon fodder.

623
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,190
Rookies?

624
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,990
Won't they hold us back?

625
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,670
In terms of probability,

626
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,840
to increase the chances of winning,

627
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,910
even if none of the people we bring in can pass the door,

628
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,910
at least

629
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,600
we need to mess up the situation

630
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,630
to get what we want.

631
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,830
It's up to you.

632
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,590
I just want a good result.

633
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,910
So far, no one has entered the 11th door.

634
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,030
Once we pass this door,

635
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,890
success will be within reach.

636
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It's quite...

637
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,880
cold here.

638
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,190
You...

639
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,350
Are you trying to say something?

640
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,270
It looks like you're not as arrogant as before.

641
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,910
And you are not that talkative now.

642
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,910
Me?

643
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,030
You seem to have changed too.

644
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,910
Me?

645
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,030
Actually, we are not familiar with each other.

646
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,630
Before,

647
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,330
we only met a few times.

648
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,760
You used to be

649
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,630
shy,

650
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,030
awkward,

651
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,710
and quite afraid of awkwardness.

652
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,770
However, just now,

653
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,790
it seems like we've reversed roles.

654
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,090
I wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't said that.

655
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,510
I just feel

656
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,590
that if you don't want to do something, then don't.

657
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,030
Don't blame me for not making you feel at home.

658
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,670
Do you want to watch TV?

659
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,670
Hey, don't.

660
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,230
Put it down.

661
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,950
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,670
The news

663
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,510
about Tan Zaozao's death

664
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,870
is everywhere on TV.

665
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,550
It almost drove me crazy.

666
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,690
Shouldn't you be happy to see a friend again,

667
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,350
no matter in what way?

668
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,210
You don't understand.

669
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,930
You don't know that in the capital world,

670
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,830
Tan Zaozao's death

671
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,370
has long been turned into a feast.

672
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,710
The distributors released

673
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,710
the Blu-rays of her early films

674
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,510
to capitalize

675
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,760
on the last wave of her fan economy.

676
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,360
They are so disgusting.

677
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,610
That's how capital works.

678
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,310
This is capital.

679
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,200
I have benefited from capital,

680
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,710
so I can't judge them.

681
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,880
But I don't agree with them.

682
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,750
It's life.

683
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,310
Life is like this,

684
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,850
always beyond one's control.

685
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,510
Beyond one's control?

686
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,750
Can't you just be yourself?

687
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,060
It seems like I've never been myself.

688
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,830
Not until I met her.

689
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,190
What are you talking about?

690
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,850
Looks like you had a good talk.

691
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,350
He said he is lucky to have met you

692
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,170
and loves you a lot.

693
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,430
Maybe that's also my change-

694
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,660
speaking out what's in my heart.

695
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,630
Let's go.

696
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,980
Thank you, bro.

697
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,030
Take care of yourself.

698
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,150
Take care of yourself.

699
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,150
We're leaving.

700
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,510
Let's go.

701
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,290
Before entering the door,

702
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
do you want to go home and take a look?

703
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,350
Okay.

704
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,990
Are you tired?

705
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,720
The woman over there

706
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,990
is my mother.

707
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,830
And there's my half-sister.

708
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,480
We're blowing bubbles.

709
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,710
Aren't you going to go over there and take a look?

710
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,150
I've already taken a look.

711
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,030
We should go now.

712
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,230
I mean,

713
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,160
you should at least go there and say hello.

714
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,590
I don't want to disturb her peaceful life.

715
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm satisfied with just a look.

716
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,950
You really are a lonely child.

717
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,480
If I were not lonely,

718
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,910
how could I become an expert at this game?
