00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,360
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,090
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,789
I can't open it.

4
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
It seems that

5
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,970
only our courtyard

6
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,250
can be entered in this whole town.

7
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,710
That means we won't find

8
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,710
any useful information in this town?

9
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,750
I think so.

10
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,360
With the Sunny Doll hung up,

11
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,120
it shouldn't rain anymore.

12
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,390
The taboo condition for this door is

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,790
not to get wet in the rain.

14
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,470
Wang Ronghua got wet in the rain yesterday,

15
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,600
and today he was made into a Sunny Doll.

16
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,710
But I think

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,190
the Sunny Doll made from a person's head

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,710
must have a time limit.

19
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,270
That's why it can keep tempting players to break the rules.

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,800
We can't stay here for long.

21
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,600
We'll be in trouble if it rains.

22
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,480
Let's go back first.

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,910
There's a path.

24
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,240
Let's go take a look.

25
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,070
Forget it. Let's go there tomorrow.

26
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,670
It's the first day. We'd better not take risks.

27
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,829
Sunny Doll.

28
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,390
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

29
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,490
Just like the sky in my dreams.

30
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,510
If it's sunny,

31
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,880
I'll give you a golden bell.

32
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,310
Sunny Doll.

33
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,470
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

34
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,790
If you listen to my wish,

35
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,850
I'll give you sweet wine to drink.

36
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,950
Sunny Doll.

37
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,990
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

38
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,150
If it's still

39
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,110
cloudy and rainy tomorrow,

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,270
I'll chop off your head.

41
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,790
What should I do?

42
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,950
I got wet in the rain.

43
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,150
Will I end up like Ronghua?

44
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,310
I don't want to die.

45
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,630
I really don't want to die.

46
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
Such an idiot

47
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,550
deserves to die.

48
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,830
No.

49
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,430
I don't want to die.

50
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,030
I don't want to die.

51
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,750
I don't want to die.

52
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,910
What's wrong?

53
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,550
It's leaking.

54
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,470
Why is it leaking all of a sudden?

55
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,909
Someone is trying to harm us.

56
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,330
Why is it leaking rain?

57
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,270
It's hard to say now.

58
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,430
Your room is leaking too?

59
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,470
Yeah. Who would have thought it would leak?

60
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,130
What's wrong with him?

61
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,260
He has a headache again.

62
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,990
You'd better lie down and rest.

63
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,990
Don't worry about him.

64
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,430
He's been suffering from it for long.

65
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,690
The more he lies down, the worse he feels.

66
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,450
If it doesn't work,

67
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,950
you can change to another room.

68
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,990
There are many rooms in the backyard.

69
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,590
Okay, we'll change it later.

70
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,710
Hey.

71
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,230
Do you think they will find out

72
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,110
that we broke their roof?

73
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,030
Let me tell you.

74
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,990
That was close.

75
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Oh no.

76
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,010
Let's change to another room.

77
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:00,790
Hey.

78
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,510
Did they really make the roof leak?

79
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,030
I hate them too,

80
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,870
but I didn't find anything

81
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,330
suspicious in their room.

82
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,530
Anyone trying to harm others will reveal himself eventually.

83
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
Go to sleep.

84
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,270
If you hear the song again tonight,

85
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,530
remember to wake me up.

86
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,630
Okay.

87
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,870
Drop the flag.

88
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,310
Drop the flag.

89
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,110
Softly behind your friend's back.

90
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,110
Everybody quiets down.

91
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
Quickly, quickly run around.

92
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,790
Is it time?

93
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,310
Quickly, quickly run around.

94
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,950
Drop the flag.

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,110
Drop the flag.

96
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:18,150
Softly behind your friend's back.

97
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,190
Everybody quiets down.

98
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,550
Quickly, quickly run around.

99
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,190
Quickly, quickly run around.

100
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,190
Drop the flag.

101
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,030
Softly behind your friend's back.

102
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,030
Everybody quiets down.

103
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,110
Quickly, quickly run around.

104
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,990
Quickly, quickly run around.

105
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,590
Drop the flag.

106
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,550
Drop the flag.

107
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,710
Softly behind your friend's back.

108
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,070
Everybody quiets down.

109
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,190
Drop the flag.

110
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,070
Drop the flag.

111
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:25,230
Softly behind your friend's back.

112
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,430
Everybody quiets down.

113
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,070
Quickly, quickly run around.

114
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,350
Quickly, quickly run around.

115
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,070
This is how the player who got wet

116
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,870
in the rain turned into a Sunny Doll.

117
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,510
The person who just held the umbrella

118
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,590
is a NPC, right?

119
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,070
Could he be a Door Ghost?

120
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,630
I don't know.

121
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,000
But the umbrella in his hand

122
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,770
must be an important prop.

123
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
With an umbrella,

124
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
you won't get wet

125
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,190
and can go further,

126
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,950
just like

127
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,350
the path we saw today.

128
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,320
Now we have a new Sunny Doll,

129
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,670
so it'll be sunny tomorrow morning.

130
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,960
We have time to look for an umbrella.

131
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Yeah.

132
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,190
Go back to sleep.

133
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,360
Look.

134
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,770
There's another Sunny Doll here.

135
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,710
It seems new.

136
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,750
I wonder which idiot

137
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,950
turned into this.

138
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,270
Am I wrong?

139
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,230
Someone died from getting wet in the rain on the first day.

140
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,070
It's such an obvious taboo condition,

141
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,230
yet he still got wet in the rain.

142
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,270
Why are they arguing so early in the morning?

143
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,430
Do you think you won't trigger the taboo conditions?

144
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,030
Stop pretending to be a big shot.

145
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,630
Are you looking for trouble?

146
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,990
Cui Xueyi.

147
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,210
Why did you pull me?

148
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,030
Can't you see that she's bullying me?

149
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,390
Why are you so cowardly?

150
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Hey.

151
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,040
Where are you going?

152
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,870
Is this your own door?

153
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,950
Well...

154
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,430
Nan.

155
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,910
It seems that the taboo condition for this door

156
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,110
is quite obvious.

157
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,230
Don't get wet in the rain.

158
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,370
Easier said than done.

159
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,630
All the doors in the town can't be opened.

160
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,030
There's nothing here, and no umbrella either.

161
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,230
How can we find the key if we can't go far?

162
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,920
If we want to go out, we must find clues.

163
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,310
Let's split up and search.

164
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,510
Share any clues we find with each other.

165
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,030
The expression of this Sunny Doll has changed.

166
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,230
It was too dark last night,

167
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,590
so I couldn't see clearly.

168
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,990
Nan's expression was blank when he just turned into

169
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,450
the Sunny Doll last night.

170
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,910
Now he's crying.

171
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,680
Maybe he's unwilling to become

172
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,790
a Sunny Doll.

173
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,430
Forget it.

174
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,560
Let's find the umbrella first.

175
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,750
The NPC last night

176
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,810
came here with the Sunny Doll.

177
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,750
He's here.

178
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,550
We can't check it out now.

179
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,910
Go back and wait.

180
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,300
I can't guarantee that both of you will survive this door.

181
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,230
How did I show off?

182
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,230
What do you think?

183
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,670
I don't...

184
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,670
Don't.

185
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,630
Who was here just now?

186
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,310
What are you talking about? No one else.

187
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,930
Who was speaking just now?

188
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,540
What's wrong with your ears?

189
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,140
No one was speaking just now.

190
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,720
He was gesturing

191
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,480
and asking me where I was going.

192
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,720
No one was talking just now.

193
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,470
Nervous wreck.

194
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,910
Weirdos.

195
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,510
What's wrong?

196
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,270
I heard Yan Shihe's voice.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yan Shihe?

198
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,910
Why didn't you

199
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,550
let me know when they came just now?

200
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,910
Why?

201
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,310
What if we got exposed?

202
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,310
I...

203
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,080
I didn't pay attention.

204
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,030
If we get exposed, then so be it.

205
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,430
We're not afraid of them.

206
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
Did they hear me when I was

207
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,110
speaking just now?

208
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,830
I don't know.

209
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,950
I didn't notice.

210
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,550
You don't know anything.

211
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,150
All you do is feed her eggs.

212
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,740
Are you a loser?

213
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,110
Why are you blaming him?

214
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,110
Go talk to those two if you have guts.

215
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,550
If it weren't for you,

216
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,680
I wouldn't have been exposed just now.

217
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,410
If you don't behave yourself,

218
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,990
don't blame me for being rude to you.

219
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,320
Are you threatening me?

220
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,610
You don't want money anymore?

221
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,870
If we are in danger,

222
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,070
you won't get a penny.

223
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,190
If I would die,

224
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,160
what's the use of money?

225
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,990
Are they

226
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,990
that scary?

227
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,270
They have blood on their hands

228
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,830
in the world behind the door.

229
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,580
What should we do then?

230
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,310
We can't just wait to die.

231
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,030
We must strike first.

232
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,190
Yun Shan. Lin Sen.

233
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,770
You didn't go out to look for clues today?

234
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,390
Oh.

235
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,310
By the way,

236
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,550
when I came back,

237
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,109
I saw that NPC going out.

238
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,940
I wanted to follow him,

239
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,450
but he disappeared as soon as he went out.

240
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,710
This town is so small.

241
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,400
Where do you think can he go?

242
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,440
It's hard to explain

243
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,710
the world inside the doors with common sense.

244
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,190
Go out and look for clues. Don't forget the time.

245
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,589
Don't get wet in the rain.

246
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,470
Okay.

247
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,589
I'll get ready.

248
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,869
Take care.

249
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,870
The NPC is out.

250
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,070
It's time to find the umbrella in the front yard.

251
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,070
Let's go.

252
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,070
Lingling.

253
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,830
Look here.

254
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,720
It's the university dormitory again.

255
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,830
I am almost absent-minded

256
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,360
every time I see this place.

257
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,830
Let me tell you.

258
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,190
At the last door,

259
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,550
if we hadn't found the oil lamp here,

260
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,010
we would have died.

261
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,950
It sounds like this room

262
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,210
is designed for you to get more props.

263
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,170
But there is no umbrella here.

264
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,150
Hey.

265
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,210
Could it be related to Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror?

266
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,120
Could this be possible?

267
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,310
This is cheating.

268
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,320
This doesn't feel good.

269
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,990
Then, what does this dorm exist for?

270
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,790
Maybe

271
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,230
it's in memory of something.

272
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,190
We have had so many things to memory lately.

273
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,750
Let's go.

274
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's find the umbrella first.

275
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,320
Let's go.

276
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,710
We haven't checked the room of the NPC.

277
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,870
Lingling.

278
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,950
Look here.

279
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,030
So many Sunny Dolls.

280
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,510
These Sunny Dolls

281
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,040
are those of last night.

282
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,090
No expression on their faces.

283
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,190
Hey.

284
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,510
The umbrella.

285
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,430
It is these Sunny Dolls

286
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,110
who have consumed

287
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,430
the players that violated the taboo conditions.

288
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,550
Should we destroy them?

289
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,230
There are so many of them.

290
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,750
They can't be destroyed in a short time.

291
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,750
Even if they were destroyed now,

292
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,550
there would be new ones tonight.

293
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,470
Sunny Dolls.

294
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,630
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

295
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,230
I knew it.

296
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,510
The Sunny Dolls

297
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,070
can last only one day.

298
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,760
I think this is the umbrella

299
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,560
taken by the person last night.

300
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,910
This umbrella

301
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,350
is too old. Can it be used?

302
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,270
Let's try it while no one's around tonight.

303
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,160
They must be asleep.

304
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,790
Let me do it.

305
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,910
It really works.

306
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,480
With this umbrella,

307
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,070
we can go to the end of the road tomorrow

308
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,270
and have a look there.

309
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,510
No one got wet today.

310
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,750
No one should be killed tonight.

311
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,110
Without new Sunny Dolls,

312
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,950
it will rain all day tomorrow.

313
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,040
Luckily, we found the umbrella.

314
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,200
We can sleep tight tonight.

315
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,210
Non-stop rain falls outside.

316
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,070
I'm afraid we can't go anywhere.

317
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,670
Aha.

318
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,470
Are you hungry? There are eggs in the room.

319
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,070
Really?

320
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,470
Let's go.

321
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,590
Bro,

322
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,840
have you found any clues today?

323
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,910
I forgot.

324
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,550
It's difficult for a disabled person

325
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,670
to play this game.

326
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,870
You

327
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,800
resemble someone I'm looking for.

328
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,590
He...

329
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,590
It's impossible.

330
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,270
He's not mute.

331
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
Yan Shihe!

332
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,490
I'm hungry.

333
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,670
Eat this.

334
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,790
Why are you still eating?

335
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,190
Ah!

336
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,280
What's wrong?

337
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,350
What happened?

338
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,240
You are still in the mood to ask?

339
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,150
Those two are going to kill us.

340
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,550
Really?

341
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,830
Why?

342
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,110
Because of you.

343
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,210
You like to provoke people.

344
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,120
He must be Yan Shihe.

345
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Hurry up.

346
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,970
Try this umbrella.

347
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,400
When we find the key,

348
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,120
he can't pretend anymore.

349
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,070
I overheard those two

350
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,990
conspiring with Wang Di

351
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,350
to make you exposed to the rain.

352
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,750
How can they do this to me?

353
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,390
I'll go find them.

354
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,070
Sit down.

355
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,190
Do you think they will stop

356
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,510
if you go find them?

357
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,350
Sit down.

358
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,510
I can't just wait.

359
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,910
I'll go.

360
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,910
I'll go talk to them.

361
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,870
I'll apologize to them.

362
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,870
Sit down.

363
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,510
For what?

364
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,800
What did we do wrong?

365
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,150
Enough.

366
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,350
It's useless.

367
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,710
They just want an excuse.

368
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,790
What should we do?

369
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,630
What should we do?

370
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,950
As I have said,

371
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,970
those who take the initiative will gain the upper hand.

372
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,190
Who's that?

373
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,150
Cui Xueyi.

374
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,200
Why are you in our room at midnight?

375
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,090
Are you sleepwalking?

376
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,550
No, I...

377
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,300
I thought it was someone else's room. I...

378
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
It's okay.

379
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,110
Take your time to make up your story.

380
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,370
We have plenty of time.

381
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,630
It's not me. It's not me.

382
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,230
He told me to come. I...

383
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,710
Did Yan Balang ask you to come here?

384
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,390
How did he know we came in this door?

385
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,950
Who's Yan Balang?

386
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,270
I don't know him.

387
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,070
You're a member of X organization.

388
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,760
How can you not know him?

389
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,270
I don't know what X organization is.

390
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,310
I...

391
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,640
You're quite stubborn.

392
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,990
Fine.

393
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,550
You planned to kill us

394
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,070
and you didn't want to tell us the truth.

395
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,070
Then I have to

396
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,800
throw you into the rain.

397
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,910
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

398
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,590
I'm not Cui Xueyi.

399
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,830
He forced me to kill you.

400
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,310
You're not Cui Xueyi?

401
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,110
I'm Gu Yuansi.

402
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,310
That mute is Cui Xueyi.

403
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,530
Xingping and I asked him to help us pass the door.

404
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,110
When we first entered,

405
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,770
he asked me to pretend to be him

406
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,630
before the NPC's self-introduction.

407
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,360
He wanted to pretend to be dumb.

408
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,500
What does he plan to do?

409
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,690
He said you were...

410
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,510
He said you were bad guys

411
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,830
who would cheat

412
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,820
newcomers as cannon fodders,

413
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,630
but he could

414
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,830
protect us secretly.

415
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,000
Protect you?

416
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,500
But now he let you take the risk.

417
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,390
He saw you holding an umbrella today.

418
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,190
He said

419
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,030
you were going to find the key with the umbrella.

420
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,030
Then we...

421
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,790
we will be trapped, dead in the door, by the rain.

422
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,400
I can't let anything happen to Xingping.

423
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,790
So I came by myself.

424
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,150
Let's go.

425
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

426
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,600
What are you doing here?

427
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,910
Get out!

428
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,070
Let him go!

429
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,430
Help! Someone is killing!

430
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,550
Shut up!

431
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,870
Otherwise, I'll kill him now.

432
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,870
Get lost!

433
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Get up.

434
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,320
Your friend has told us all.

435
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,110
Stop pretending.

436
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,000
Do you want me to tear your mouth apart?

437
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Stop pretending.

438
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,560
We've known everything.

439
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,080
You are so stubborn.

440
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,110
Yuansi!

441
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,430
Meng Yu.

442
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,670
Yan Shihe.

443
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,150
I've been looking for you everywhere!

444
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,230
Lingling.

445
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,310
Lingling.

446
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,790
Lingling.

447
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,790
Lingling. Lingling. Lingling.

448
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,730
Lingling, I was wrong. Lingling.

449
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,790
Yuansi!

450
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,110
Yuansi.

451
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,030
You can't go there.

452
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,750
I'm a jerk.

453
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,870
I'm a bastard.

454
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,110
Lingling.

455
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,350
I was too greedy.

456
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,830
I listened to Xia and Yan Balang.

457
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,630
But if I didn't do this,

458
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,990
they would kill me inside the door.

459
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,350
So I was forced.

460
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,510
Who will bring my friend back to life?

461
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,510
I'll kill you now.

462
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,640
No, listen to me.

463
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,870
I...

464
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,510
I'm just a scumbag.

465
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,110
It's useless even if you kill me.

466
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,830
Everything was planned

467
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,870
by Yan Balang.

468
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,790
Yan Balang is the murderer.

469
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,810
I'm willing to tell you everything

470
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,710
that Yan Balang has done.

471
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,310
I don't want to hear it anymore!

472
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,310
Stop!

473
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,290
Throw him into the rain

474
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,790
and let him die alone.

475
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,350
No, Lingling.

476
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,830
Please don't.

477
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,110
Ah!

478
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,150
Stand up.

479
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,190
Lingling.

480
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,230
Yan Balang has a new plan.

481
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,550
Every player

482
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,910
will suffer when passing the door.

483
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,060
Tell me.

484
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,710
Yes.

485
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,550
Yan Balang has found

486
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,860
the clue to the twelfth door.

487
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,990
Nonsense.

488
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,990
He only has those who passed the tenth door.

489
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,630
How can he know about the twelfth door?

490
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,230
He found a cheat overseas.

491
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,360
The gap between the doors became shorter.

492
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,590
It's true.

493
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,850
So you have clues to the twelfth door?

494
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,030
No.

495
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,350
He didn't tell me.

496
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,310
Then what's the point of telling me that?

497
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,660
I can help you steal it.

498
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,110
If you spare my life,

499
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,390
I'm willing to be your informant.

500
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,630
You don't want Yan Balang to pass first, do you?

501
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,350
Many people will get hurt then.

502
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,380
Actually, I'm also a victim.

503
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:50,750
Ah?

504
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,080
I was fooled by him.

505
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,030
I know...

506
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,790
I know you...

507
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,550
I know you are good people.

508
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,470
Please

509
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,710
give me a chance to start over.

510
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,750
I kowtow to you.

511
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,480
I beg you.

512
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm a bastard. Please forgive me.

513
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,630
I kowtow to you.

514
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,150
Tie him up first.

515
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,470
I'm willing to redeem everything.

516
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,070
I will make up for it.

517
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,590
I will.

518
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,270
Drop the flag.

519
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,030
Drop the flag.

520
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:58,030
Softly behind your friend's back.

521
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,910
Everybody quiets down.

522
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,270
Quickly, quickly run around.

523
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,550
Quickly, quickly run around.

524
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,030
Drop the flag.

525
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,790
Drop the flag.

526
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,350
Softly behind your friend's back.

527
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,989
Everybody quiets down.

528
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,510
Do you think

529
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,710
we should kill Yan Shihe?

530
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,150
I want to kill him on my own

531
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,949
to avenge Li Dongyuan.

532
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,070
I understand.

533
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,030
Even if we kill Yan Shihe,

534
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,630
X organization will send someone else.

535
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,610
He's like a hyena on the savannah.

536
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,389
Although he's afraid of lions,

537
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,850
he always looks for opportunities to fight against lions.

538
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,990
Then I'll

539
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,870
wait for them.

540
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,990
Today, we're going to the end of the path

541
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,990
to look for clues.

542
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,080
But that small path is too long.

543
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,020
If we walk for too long,

544
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,080
what if it rains...

545
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,990
We have this.

546
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,950
Today, you guys keep an eye on Yan Shihe,

547
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,350
and wait for our message.

548
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,600
You guys be careful.

549
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,530
It seems that the old man sang nursery rhymes again.

550
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,370
Gu Yuansi has sacrificed too.

551
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,150
It's really a long way.

552
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,270
We've been walking for four hours and still haven't arrived.

553
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,390
The feet can cover a considerable distance.

554
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,790
Every path has its end.

555
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,070
Could these be the Flowers in water?

556
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,390
Let's go in and have a look.

557
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,490
There are so many Sunny Dolls.

558
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,850
(Never tired of learning)

559
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,910
This is a school.

560
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,000
The smiling Sunny Dolls

561
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,230
are listening to a lecture given by the sad Sunny Doll.

562
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,430
I remember the story saying that

563
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,990
the teacher became the Sunny Doll in place of the student.

564
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,230
The one on the stage is the teacher, right?

565
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,670
Yes.

566
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
(Never tired of learning)

567
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,700
Then he should be the Door Ghost,

568
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,110
nothing special.

569
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,950
Look behind him.

570
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,990
He's the Door Ghost after all.

571
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,190
Don't approach for now without the key.

572
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,630
The Sunny Dolls in the courtyard

573
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,490
all have crying expressions,

574
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,230
while those are smiling.

575
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,870
What's going on?

576
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,870
Perhaps the teacher

577
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,800
has dispelled the sadness in the hearts of the students.

578
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,510
Let's go.

579
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,660
Look.

580
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,630
Bad news, Yunshan!

581
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,390
Yan Shihe escaped.

582
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,490
I'm sorry. It's my carelessness.

583
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,670
So, he doesn't know

584
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,670
what the clues for the 12th door are.

585
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,730
This is just his delaying tactic.

586
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,430
Have you searched the entire courtyard?

587
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,430
Yes, I searched,

588
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,920
but couldn't find any trace of him.

589
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,830
There's no hiding place in the whole town.

590
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,220
If he's not hiding in the courtyard,

591
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,350
then he must be at the mountain school.

592
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,630
But there is a long path.

593
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,190
Without an umbrella,

594
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,110
he'll definitely get caught in the rain.

595
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,840
It's undoubtedly a death trap.

596
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,910
It's really too easy for him.

597
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,470
Don't worry.

598
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,310
He can't escape this game.
