00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:27,289
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,910
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,890
This one is silent too.

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,910
Silent again?

5
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,030
You open it.

6
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,030
Me?

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,270
Yes.

8
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,550
My brother hasn't eaten either.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
You go ahead.

10
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,010
It's the password.

11
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,190
Eight?

12
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,830
It's the second or fourth digit password.

13
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,830
How did you know?

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,050
The time display is a four-digit number,

15
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,430
and the first and third digits can't both be eight.

16
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,430
Yes.

17
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,030
Opening the safe

18
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,960
is the most troublesome way to leave here.

19
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:24,960
Why?

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,300
Because the password may not be in one person's possession,

21
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,030
so when it's time to pass the door, whose note should be considered?

22
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,350
Forget it.

23
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,190
We opened two boxes, and nothing happened.

24
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,920
Let's go eat.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,150
OK.

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,790
We can finally have a meal.

27
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,110
It's really not easy.

28
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,590
Xia, what should we do next?

29
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,870
I'm starving.

30
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,770
You have to be responsible for us.

31
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,070
We are all adults.

32
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,430
Why do you always want someone else to take responsibility for you?

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,310
That's not what you said before.

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,920
What if we can't pass the door?

35
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
Get lost!

36
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,310
They opened the box too.

37
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,040
It seems they couldn't resist either.

38
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,200
What did you all get?

39
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,390
We opened two empty boxes and a box contained the left hand of the Box Demon,

40
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,030
and got a digit of password

41
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,710
taking our chances.

42
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,400
(Left Hand, Tip: The left hand can manipulate players into opening boxes.)

43
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,870
We've all made our marks.

44
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,750
What's the use of the Box Demon's left hand?

45
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,650
It's a troublesome skill.

46
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,270
Both the left and right hands

47
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,029
can force a person

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,149
to open a designated box.

49
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,029
So, did you mean

50
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,680
she can specify who to kill?

51
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,160
But it might also be our chance.

52
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,310
In fact, both the Box Demon and the Box Slave

53
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,390
can be killed,

54
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,920
but it requires special props.

55
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,590
Just use them before opening the box.

56
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,550
It's not that simple.

57
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,190
So what did you find when opening boxes?

58
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,360
We found one digit of the password.

59
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,070
If you find other digits,

60
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,110
we can cooperate.

61
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,430
This is a password. How can we cooperate?

62
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,490
What about the note for the next door?

63
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,750
Whoever finds more digit passwords

64
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,790
gets the key.

65
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,190
If we find the same digits,

66
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,590
we'll decide by rock-paper-scissors.

67
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
It's fair anyway.

68
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,040
It's all about luck.

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,350
Luck will always be on our side.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,690
The four of you only opened just two boxes.

71
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,630
It seems luck isn't on your side.

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,430
You...

73
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,550
Stop talking to her.

74
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,610
Let's leave after finishing eating.

75
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,430
The compass is spinning.

76
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,030
The Box Demon is about to act.

77
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,500
What's wrong with you?

78
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,410
What's wrong with you?

79
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,160
Are you feeling unwell?

80
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,430
Zhu Meng.

81
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,590
Zhu Meng.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,830
Turn around.

83
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,090
Don't look at that box. Look at me.

84
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,390
There seems to be an important prop in that box.

85
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,790
Oh no! The Box Demon has used its skill!

86
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,270
It's left hand!

87
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,550
There must be something inside

88
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,710
that can kill the Box Demon.

89
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,360
As long as we open it,

90
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,070
we can go back

91
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,830
to the real world.

92
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,750
Zhu Meng, wake up.

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
Don't open the box, Zhu Meng.

94
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,290
Don't open the box!

95
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,310
Hang in there.

96
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,270
Don't open the box, Zhu Meng.

97
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,390
Zhu Meng!

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,390
Hey.

99
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:27,990
Hey.

100
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,630
He still wants to open it.

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,550
Lingling.

102
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,750
No.

103
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:47,670
Hey.

104
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,870
Zhu Meng.

105
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,710
What happened to me?

106
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
You got hit.

107
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,070
You were almost dead.

108
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,550
Fortunately, Lingling had a prop.

109
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,360
He took a step ahead of you and killed the Box Slave.

110
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,760
Seeing you still got hit,

111
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,990
he opened the box.

112
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,270
Luckily nothing happened.

113
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,910
It scared me to death.

114
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,550
Even if I got hit,

115
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,830
you shouldn't have opened the box.

116
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,090
What if it didn't work?

117
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,230
I made sure the Box Slave was already dead

118
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,950
before opening it.

119
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm fine now.

120
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,110
What were you sure of?

121
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,570
Did you take me as Mu Yu?

122
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,669
You insulted me.

123
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,909
I'm not stupid.

124
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,510
It's strange.

125
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,660
Sun Yuanzhou just opened a box that had the left hand of the Box Demon in it.

126
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,520
She couldn't wait to use the skill

127
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,270
as if it was specifically targeted.

128
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,470
Was she targeting us?

129
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,350
Could someone have found the eyes of the Box Demon?

130
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,960
The Box Demon's eyes

131
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,470
are used to find that red comb,

132
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,990
and the comb is used to block the its hair,

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,060
so the possibility of it being used against me is not very high.

134
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,160
Do you still remember the rules of the board game?

135
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,350
About whether players

136
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,210
choose to disclose information.

137
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,830
Oh,

138
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,470
you mean

139
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,550
our information is open

140
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,950
to the Box Demon.

141
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,830
Yes.

142
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,030
Now it seems that the rules outside the door

143
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,390
are almost the same as the ones inside the door.

144
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,070
I recall the rules of the board game.

145
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,390
When a player opens a certain prop,

146
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,310
he can choose to disclose the information

147
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,390
or keep it private.

148
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,150
Disclosing information has its benefits.

149
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,990
Everyone will know the situation of the prop,

150
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,670
and the Box Demon will also

151
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,670
be aware of it,

152
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,820
knowing what information the player has obtained.

153
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,210
If that's really the case,

154
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,790
it's not good.

155
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,070
The Box Demon

156
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,240
should be aware of our information all the time.

157
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,250
Otherwise, it wouldn't be in such a hurry to kill me.

158
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,150
It seems that

159
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,470
Xia is really smart.

160
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,670
She didn't hurry to reveal her strength,

161
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,130
which made her quite safe.

162
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,510
Because now, I am the only one

163
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,230
who knows the game rules.

164
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,230
If I am dead,

165
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,510
the Box Demon's next moves will be easily controlled.

166
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,590
Because no player knows

167
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,110
how to use the props and skills.

168
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,080
But the Box Demon's ears

169
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,480
haven't been found yet.

170
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,510
How did she know?

171
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,710
I guess

172
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,470
we have an informant among us who is working for the Box Demon.

173
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,710
When I was looking up information outside,

174
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,190
it was the first time I learned about the rules of the Box Demon Game.

175
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,190
Chen Fei introduced the rules to us.

176
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,190
According to this logic,

177
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,710
no matter what game we play,

178
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,440
there should be an introduction or explanation,

179
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,590
at least letting the players know how to play.

180
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,110
But so far, it seems that

181
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,640
no one knows how to play.

182
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,630
Yes, this informant

183
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,270
probably hid the game manual,

184
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,870
so now they want to kill me.

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes.

186
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,870
Who is the informant?

187
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,350
Xia?

188
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,170
It's unlikely to be her.

189
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,150
Given our relationship outside the door,

190
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,610
if she were the informant,

191
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,230
she would have taken action against us a long time ago,

192
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,890
instead of waiting until now.

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,720
Zhu Meng.

194
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Yu Lingling.

195
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,370
I'll go out and take a look.

196
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,890
I want to talk to him alone.

197
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,430
Before you say anything,

198
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,230
let me ask you a question.

199
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,010
Go ahead.

200
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,470
If I were in the same situation,

201
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,670
would you open the box before me?

202
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,350
Silence is an admission.

203
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,430
So, don't say much.

204
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,390
We both know

205
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,650
what the other will do.

206
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,470
I just wanted you to survive.

207
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,550
At least, don't die for me.

208
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,160
When facing the same situation again,

209
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,120
we would both make the same choice.

210
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,920
You can't protect others forever.

211
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,820
I remember you told me something

212
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,270
in the Snow Village:

213
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,990
you have to get used to others being kind to you.

214
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,430
There is something wrong.

215
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,430
Let's go.

216
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,750
What's up?

217
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,030
We obtained a prop.

218
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,630
What prop is it?

219
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
A lighter.

220
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,140
(Lighter) (Tips: Lighters can restrict the movement of Box Demon. Use it before opening)

221
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,160
I want to ask you how to use this.

222
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,670
A lighter can restrict the movement of Box Demon once.

223
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,200
A pair of scissors can interrupt the movement of Box Demon once.

224
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,840
What's the difference between restricting and interrupting?

225
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,600
Can you explain it clearly?

226
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
For example,

227
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,150
I was hit just now.

228
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,440
The Box Demon used her left hand to attack me.

229
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
What?

230
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,470
Didn't we just find her left hand skill?

231
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,180
Then why did you...

232
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,790
Did you find new props?

233
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,470
No.

234
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,210
It was broken by a prop brought from outside.

235
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,910
Go on.

236
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,110
The Box Demon used her left hand to attack me.

237
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,110
If I had scissors,

238
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,790
I could cut the Box Slave's hair

239
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,050
before I was dragged by

240
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,110
the Box Slave's hair

241
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,350
or hands into the box.

242
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,670
The Box Demon's skill will be interrupted.

243
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,670
In other words,

244
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,150
at least her skill is invalid in this round.

245
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
What about the restricting?

246
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,470
The lighter can kill the Box Slave,

247
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,510
but you have to use it before you open the box.

248
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,950
If the Box Demon uses her left hand skill

249
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,350
to force you to open a box.

250
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,080
But you used a lighter

251
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,280
before opening a box,

252
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,070
maybe the box is empty.

253
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,240
The Box Demon can use this method

254
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,950
to waste the props.

255
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,590
Right.

256
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,150
You can use scissors under any conditions,

257
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,960
but not the lighter.

258
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,590
At least it's a useful prop.

259
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,510
I want to ask you.

260
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,110
How many times can the Box Demon use her skills?

261
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,270
Only once.

262
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,030
For example, the left hand skill.

263
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,630
It will return to the box after using the skill.

264
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,110
She needs us to open another right box

265
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,370
before using it again.

266
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,530
It should be like this in the door.

267
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,550
By the way,

268
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,950
my friends

269
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,710
found a new prop.

270
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,610
But don't tell others.

271
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,750
What prop?

272
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,070
A red comb.

273
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,150
If we use it to comb the Box Demon's hair,

274
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,440
we can kill her.

275
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,450
But if the Box Demon finds out,

276
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,010
it'll be troublesome.

277
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,470
Why did you tell me?

278
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,910
Aren't you afraid that she'll hide in these boxes?

279
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,360
Didn't we confirm that

280
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,110
the Box Demon is in the bathroom?

281
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,640
Besides,

282
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,710
she won't be able to go anywhere

283
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,770
before the box with left or right foot is opened.

284
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,830
Anyway,

285
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,470
if you find the Box Demon's hair,

286
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,400
tell me ASAP.

287
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,550
Then we can go out early.

288
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,550
No problem.

289
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,070
Keep us

290
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,070
in touch.

291
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,110
Okay.

292
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,030
When did you find the comb?

293
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,910
I didn't find it.

294
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,490
Are you testing Sun Yuanzhou?

295
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,270
Unfortunately, Lingling's hearing

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,880
can only be used twice a day.

297
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,310
If Lingling's hearing skill is useful,

298
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,480
maybe my sense of smell can also be useful.

299
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,750
Right.

300
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,950
What if the prop has a smell?

301
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,790
Or the body part may have a smell.

302
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,870
Maybe the Box Demon's feet stink.

303
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,870
Let's go.

304
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,630
Let's find a place to try.

305
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,590
Here.

306
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,960
It's well-ventilated.

307
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,350
Try it.

308
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,910
Brother, come on.

309
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,510
How is it?

310
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,480
There's something.

311
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,670
It smells rusty.

312
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,550
It's iron.

313
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,869
Iron?

314
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,349
It should be a prop we can use.

315
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,730
(Scissors) (Tips: scissors can cut the Box Demon's hair and hands. Interrupting the Box Demon's Skill)

316
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,069
Scissors.

317
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,240
It's a pair of scissors!

318
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,950
It is such an amazing feeling.

319
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,150
I didn't have it when I needed it.

320
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,750
I just got out of danger, but I get it now.

321
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,280
The can opener was invented

322
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,080
10 years later than the can.

323
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,740
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

324
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
Take it.

325
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,310
Keep it.

326
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,970
It feels like you are taking care of the weakest person.

327
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,910
Brother, smell some more later.

328
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,050
Give Ruan one prop.

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,390
Then all of us can eat.

330
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,760
Brother, what do you smell?

331
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,510
Is it the Box Demon?

332
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,910
I can't smell anything.

333
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,750
But you just opened one box.

334
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,410
Why can't you smell anything?

335
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,470
It seems that Yixie's sense of smell skill

336
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,930
can only be used once a day.

337
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,990
Ruan, you...

338
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,210
I'm not hungry yet.

339
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,770
Now we can open three boxes every day.

340
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,310
We have three places to eat.

341
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,370
One person will take turns to starve.

342
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I can hold on.

343
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,670
Look.

344
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,400
Why are there so many boxes?

345
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,730
What are you doing?

346
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,300
What are you doing?

347
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,200
Don't open the box recklessly.

348
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,110
We're so unlucky.

349
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,910
We found an eye first.

350
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,270
Xia,

351
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,880
can you control your people?

352
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,070
Will you be happy

353
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,070
if we all die?

354
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,910
Are you kidding me?

355
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,910
We have props. How can we die?

356
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,870
You're the ones who should die.

357
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,600
You're the ones who should die.

358
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,270
Say that again!

359
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,350
You...

360
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,510
Don't.

361
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,710
Are you going to hit a woman?

362
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,310
Calm down.

363
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,160
Don't let her provoke you.

364
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,550
Coward!

365
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,620
Die in this door!

366
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,990
Say that again!

367
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,270
You...

368
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
What's wrong?

369
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,150
Why are you so emotional?

370
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,630
Her people opened the box recklessly

371
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,990
and found an eye.

372
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Organs again.

373
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,150
Looks like the Box Demon is going to use her skill again.

374
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,710
The eyes of the Box Demon can let her see

375
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,470
her favorite red comb.

376
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,150
Whoever has a red comb will be the unlucky one.

377
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,910
Have a good rest.

378
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,280
I'll figure something out.

379
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,990
Zhu Meng.

380
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,030
Well.

381
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,310
T-Take care.

382
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,310
Let's go.

383
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,470
Do you think this person is reliable?

384
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,110
It'd be a bit of a coincidence.

385
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,640
We just said we got the comb,

386
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,290
and then they found an eye.

387
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,230
Let's see whether

388
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,730
the Box Demon will use her skill on me.

389
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,720
The Box Demon has used her skill today.

390
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,950
But we'll know after midnight.

391
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,710
Let's sleep.

392
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,310
I don't have the comb anyway.

393
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,230
The Box Demon will only waste her one skill.

394
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,750
Zhu Meng, I won't sleep tonight.

395
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,970
I'll stay with you.

396
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,160
They slept so well.

397
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,950
Stop coughing.

398
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,590
I heard it.

399
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,670
I'll hang on a little longer.

400
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,200
I can eat tomorrow morning.

401
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,560
You have chocolate.

402
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,110
Why didn't you eat it?

403
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,430
I wanted to give you one last night,

404
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,450
and leave one for you tonight.

405
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,470
I didn't expect you to open the box.

406
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,080
But I already ate today.

407
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,920
You don't eat even though you're so starving.

408
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,990
What if you starve next time?

409
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,240
I'll leave it to you.

410
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,030
Thank you.

411
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,590
I said

412
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,410
I'll protect you forever.

413
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,870
Whether it's your life

414
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,230
or mine.

415
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,370
A lifetime is too long.

416
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,150
I hope you can eat it now.

417
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,230
It's morning.

418
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,310
The Box Demon hasn't taken action yet.

419
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,270
So Sun Yuanzhou is clear?

420
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,830
I think so.

421
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,390
But we need to do something to give the

422
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,990
informant a chance to make contributions.

423
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,720
And let him know we noticed him.

424
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,830
Right.

425
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,790
Wake them up.

426
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,870
Let's open boxes.

427
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,370
Starving me today.

428
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,520
You should eat more.

429
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,870
Okay.

430
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,790
I've found the comb.

431
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,110
The prop to kill the Box Demon.

432
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,950
As long as you find the head of the Box Demon

433
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,350
and comb her hair with it,

434
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,550
we can go out.

435
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,910
But this comb is very dangerous.

436
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,310
I'm wondering if I should put it back.

437
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,350
Don't.

438
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,010
What if the box demon destroys it?

439
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,430
You can give it to me if you don't want it.

440
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,430
I'm not afraid.

441
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,750
If you're not afraid, how could I be?

442
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,110
That's it.

443
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,980
I'll keep the comb.

444
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,080
Let's find the head earlier

445
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,570
and get out of here.

446
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,390
Zhu Meng.

447
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,470
May I have a word with you?

448
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,950
Go ahead.

449
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,350
Am I clear now?

450
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,000
You're indeed a master.

451
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,950
You should be the strongest opponent here.

452
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,510
If we don't rule you out first,

453
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,550
we'll all be doomed.

454
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,670
We're not enemies,

455
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,320
and then we're friends.

456
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,190
Have you figured out who the informant is?

457
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,990
I'm not sure.

458
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,230
But he will take action soon.

459
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,890
He will give himself away.

460
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,600
The Box Demon has activated her skill.

461
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,310
Looks like he's done for this time.

462
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,630
Lingling, what are you worried about?

463
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,710
He didn't...

464
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,710
He's fine.

465
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,110
Where's the comb?

466
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,270
How come?

467
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,590
Zhu Meng, didn't you say you have the comb?

468
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,660
The Box Demon activated her skill,

469
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,920
but nothing happened.

470
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,310
What?

471
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,640
You really want the Box Demon's skill to work?

472
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,470
Impossible.

473
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,950
You can't resist the Box Demon's skill.

474
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,190
Why not?

475
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,510
Maybe, I don't have the comb at all.

476
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,110
Or maybe I lied to you.

477
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,950
If I didn't lie to you,

478
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,630
how could the Box Demon use her skill

479
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,400
and waste a chance?

480
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,750
W-What do you mean?

481
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,790
It means there's an informant among us.

482
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,270
Today until now,

483
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
the Box Demon hasn't used her skill.

484
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,390
But when I said I had the comb,

485
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,010
the compass moved.

486
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,520
He didn't want to wait for a moment.

487
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,830
Someone here tipped off the Box Demon.

488
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,710
How is that possible?

489
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,870
What's in it for him?

490
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,590
There are too many benefits.

491
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,430
He chose to work with the Box Demon.

492
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,430
When he killed us,

493
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,790
he could go out as he wanted.

494
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,110
He should be the first one to get here.

495
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,590
He hid the game manual.

496
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,190
If I had played this game,

497
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,790
we would just have waited to die.

498
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,390
So who came first?

499
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,510
Who is the first?

500
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,870
I think what he said makes sense.

501
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,270
But

502
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,110
there is a huge hole in it.

503
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,190
The premise of all this

504
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,970
is that the information he provided is correct.

505
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,750
But if the things about the red comb

506
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,990
and the so-called body skills

507
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,390
were made up by him,

508
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,710
then all this doesn't exist.

509
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,950
You're still so meticulous.

510
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,270
It's just a reasonable doubt.

511
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,190
Like you said,

512
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,590
you can lie to everyone

513
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,430
to achieve your purpose of leaving here alone.

514
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,830
Since we came here,

515
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,580
you've been

516
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,380
providing us with information.

517
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,550
You're the only one

518
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,990
who has played such an obscure game?

519
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,670
Yes, that makes sense.

520
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,030
So if someone

521
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,550
hid the game manual,

522
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,750
I think that person is you.

523
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,720
Eighty percent of the truth

524
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,550
plus twenty percent of lies

525
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,400
can deceive everyone,

526
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
right?

527
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,150
Is it enough?

528
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,670
So you have a note.

529
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,270
Sorry.

530
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
I like you.

531
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,390
You admitted your mistakes.

532
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,540
If you had taken this out earlier,

533
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
we would have...

534
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,580
But can't this so-called note

535
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,310
be forged?

536
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,190
The texture of the note is special.

537
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,550
Even if it's forged, it must be done outside the door.

538
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,510
But how did you know

539
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,840
what would happen in the door at that time?

540
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,310
I-I'm just asking.

541
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,110
Do you have any questions?

542
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,610
Since there's no problem.

543
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,790
How about this?

544
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,100
First, take good care of yourselves.

545
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,130
After all, there is

546
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,530
an informant of the Box Demon.

547
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,750
If you have any problem,

548
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,990
you can come to me in private.

549
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,350
Don't worry. No one else will know.

550
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,950
Are we going to share new information?

551
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,630
If it's about leaving here,

552
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,050
you can discuss it in private.

553
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,270
If it's about props

554
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,550
or the way to kill the Box Demon,

555
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,750
we can share it publicly.

556
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,000
But we don't know who the suspect is.

557
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,460
How can we discuss things?

558
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,550
Let's go.

559
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,470
We have opened a lot of boxes.

560
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,070
If the informant of the Box Demon

561
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,470
opens the box of her body,

562
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,960
it's not good for us.

563
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,840
Shall we continue opening?

564
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
No.

565
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,200
We've opened boxes today.

566
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,310
Starving me.

567
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,800
It's okay. I have eaten things these days.

568
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,830
What props do we have now?

569
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,350
Sun Yuanzhou has a lighter.

570
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,030
Ji has a stethoscope.

571
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,070
We have scissors.

572
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,630
We opened a box of number three this morning.

573
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,070
Now we have two numbers.

574
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,110
Three and eight.

575
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,270
We opened more skill boxes than prop boxes.

576
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,350
We're in a bad spot.

577
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,230
Opening the box is just about luck.

578
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,830
It's too hard.

579
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,790
I just told everyone that

580
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,710
there's an informant among us.

581
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,790
What would you do if you were the informant?

582
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,830
If I were the informant,

583
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,910
I would hide my identity if I had the advantage.

584
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,390
I won't expose myself.

585
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,600
If I were the informant,

586
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,150
I would find the Box Demon to get some props.

587
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,110
I'm afraid he'll stay clamer than us.

588
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,850
Then we'll be screwed.

589
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,950
Is there a better way?

590
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,590
It sounds like

591
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,440
we have no initiative.

592
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,400
(Opened, empty)

593
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,550
Let's go to find Sun Yuanzhou first.

594
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,510
I think he's prepared.

595
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,910
Sun,

596
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:49,790
there isn't an echo from the box.

597
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,430
Does it mean it's empty?

598
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,710
You're not picking a watermelon here.

599
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,710
Am I gonna open it or not?

600
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,950
It's a gamble about luck anyway.

601
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,090
The decision is yours.

602
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,740
Then...

603
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,510
I'll open it.

604
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,430
I'm really gonna open it.

605
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,650
(Torso Tips: The torso can destroy everyone in the same room as the Box Demon)

606
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,710
The torso?

607
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,030
What's the secret about the torso?

608
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,950
The torso is the scariest one

609
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,550
among all the body parts of the Box Demon.

610
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
Once its function is activated,

611
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,630
all the people in the same room

612
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,550
as the Box Demon will be killed.

613
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,070
I-It...

614
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,430
Sorry. I didn't know that.

615
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,390
No worries. We couldn't avoid it anyway.

616
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,350
How are we gonna deal with the torso?

617
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,350
When the Box Demon performs a function,

618
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,070
the body part representing it will automatically disappear,

619
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,130
and go back to a box.

620
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,550
We don't need to do anything about this.

621
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,230
Sun, do you think we'll be able to leave this place?

622
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,600
We'll have to roll the dice.

623
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,350
I've got this one covered.

624
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,389
This number takes either the second or the fourth place.

625
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,389
In the past,

626
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,220
(Opened, part of the combination)

627
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,949
I never counted on my luck for anything.

628
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,830
It has never occurred to me that I'd be taking such grave risks in this door challenge.

629
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,510
I'm afraid that when I'm out of this place,

630
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,910
I'll become much bolder.

631
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,230
Now we've got three numbers of the four-digit combination.

632
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,110
When we get the last one,

633
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,310
we can try opening the safe in the study.

634
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,870
Don't we need to insert the numbers in the right order?

635
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,310
We sure do. But that part depends on our luck.

636
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,390
We have to rely on our luck to find out the correct order.

637
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,150
But the last number has to be certain, right?

638
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,400
I've got a number.

639
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,880
You're alone? Where's Xia?

640
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,580
We aren't always together.

641
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,170
We're just fellow players. I'm not very close with her.

642
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,050
The last number is in my hands.

643
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,910
Are you gonna give it to us?

644
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,750
We all aim to solve this door challenge anyway.

645
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,550
I wouldn't mind giving it to you.

646
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,170
What do you want in return?

647
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,600
What can I possibly ask for?

648
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,430
I'm just being nice and doing a good deed.

649
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,390
Are you fraternizing with us behind Xia's back?

650
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,470
Having a friend is better than having a foe.

651
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,600
Don't overthink it.

652
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,150
Plus, there isn't a feud between us, right?

653
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,190
Drop the act.

654
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,070
Just say it. What do you want?

655
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,560
Please don't feel pressured. I...

656
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,630
I have only one number. It's not much helpful to me.

657
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,390
I might as well share it with you.

658
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,750
After all, we see each other quite often.

659
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,470
I'd like to reduce the tension between us.

660
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,150
That's a lot of talking. Why not show us the number?

661
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,410
Give it to us, will you?

662
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,350
Fine.

663
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,840
She and you are separate individuals.

664
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,530
We won't be hostile to you.

665
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,490
Don't worry. It's authentic.

666
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,790
The props in the door challenges can't be forged.

667
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,190
It's just too difficult.

668
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,250
But a friend of ours can make that happen.

669
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,210
It's a shame that he's killed by the X organization.

670
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,550
That's why we won't stop going after Xia.

671
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,850
Xia and I are just collaborating.

672
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,090
I'm not a member of her organization.

673
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,890
Let's go. Time to crack the combination.

674
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,240
What are you doing here?

675
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,540
They seem to have found the four numbers,

676
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,590
so they're now heading to open the safe.

677
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,000
Before they can figure out the correct order of the four numbers?

678
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,350
I arrived here not long ago, so I only caught the last few words they said.

679
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,870
Shall we go take a look?

680
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,950
Why would we tag along with them?

681
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,950
Let's find the props first. I've got a plan.

682
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,190
Is he up to this?

683
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
He surely is.

684
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:42,350
The safe and the floor standing clock are an item.

685
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,070
The clock isn't working now.

686
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,990
It means the combination

687
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,370
is related to the time shown on the clock.

688
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,070
Now we have all the four numbers.

689
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,940
Eight, three, seven, one.

690
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,710
If the combination reflects the time on the clock,

691
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,910
then 7 and 8

692
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,150
can't take the second or the fourth place.

693
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,910
3 can't be the first digit.

694
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,990
So 1 must take the first place.

695
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,190
He's good.

696
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,430
Then the order should be 1, 3, 7, 8.

697
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,190
You're even sillier than me.

698
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,550
13:78

699
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,320
is actually 14:18, isn't it?

700
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,020
If the first digit is 1,

701
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,310
then the third place can't be taken by 7 or 8.

702
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,150
There are only two possibilities left.

703
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,990
It's either 1, 7, 3, 8,

704
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,580
or 1, 8, 3, 7.

705
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,670
That's right. It's getting close.

706
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,110
As I said, he's surely up to this.

707
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,610
What is this about?

708
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,510
If that's the wrong combination,

709
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,370
wouldn't he have been dragged away by the Box Demon?

710
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,790
Is that the correct combination or not?

711
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,790
The whole thing's still about luck.

712
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,690
Lingling never relies on luck for anything.

713
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,590
You should keep your mouth shut.
