(THE SPIREALM)

00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,020
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,479
Let's go.

4
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,590
Go.

5
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,930
She's not coming after us, is she?

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
Thank God we brought one with us.

7
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,350
Let's go find the kids.

8
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,390
You...

9
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,800
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
I should've figured out long ago

11
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,070
that without an expert in medicine as her accomplice,

12
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,829
Mrs. Yu wouldn't have known datura could be a hallucinogenic drug.

13
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,030
Don't beat yourself up.

14
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,360
I figured it out myself.

15
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,070
Let's say that's your achievement too.

16
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,070
Tell us the truth.

17
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,690
Now it's getting late.

18
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,710
We have other things to do.

19
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,670
Make a long story short, alright?

20
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,470
Bah!

21
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,550
It's no wonder that you didn't answer us

22
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,710
when we asked you what was in the bowl.

23
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,160
It turns out that you two are in collusion.

24
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,990
I'm telling you,

25
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,910
I won't say anything.

26
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,550
Mister,

27
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,480
do you wanna say something now?

28
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,430
I-I...

29
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,230
I am indeed

30
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,040
working with Mrs. Yu

31
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,670
in child trafficking.

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,270
We're using the River God Festival as an excuse.

33
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,390
The foolish citizens here all fear the River God.

34
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,830
They'd rather sacrifice their children,

35
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,390
than get close to the river.

36
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,100
So, before the children

37
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,390
are brought to the river,

38
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
we swapped them in secret,

39
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,470
and transfer them at night.

40
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,950
You guys are evil!

41
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,860
Worrying about being discovered,

42
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,910
Mrs. Yu spreads the word that human oil lamps can provide protection.

43
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,970
In fact, we've added datura and herbs

44
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,510
that help with sleep into the human oil lamps.

45
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,570
This way, at night,

46
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,350
everybody would fall asleep.

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,070
Well, guy,

48
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,800
I think I've just found the key to the exit.

49
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,240
Why didn't you play by the book?

50
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,270
I was gonna ask him about the key.

51
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,990
How good are you at sprinting?

52
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,510
I always have to sprint to catch a bus.

53
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,790
I guess I'm a good runner.

54
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,140
Wait.

55
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,310
Is it your plan to outrun her?

56
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,870
Don't you think it's too rough and direct?

57
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,750
Things in a low-level door challenge like this aren't very complicated.

58
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,750
As usual,

59
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,150
I'll go first.

60
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
Run!

61
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll take care of the rest, while you'll run away.

62
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,710
I know where your son is!

63
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,390
Don't you try to lie to me!

64
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,090
Just now and some time ago,

65
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,310
I already noticed that your face

66
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,150
would occasionally twitch a bit.

67
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,550
It's a hereditary neurological disorder.

68
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
Your son Yu Caizhe

69
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,909
has this illness too, right?

70
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,630
Coincidentally,

71
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,990
I know a kid

72
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,250
with the same problem.

73
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,950
He's about your son's age.

74
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,990
My son?

75
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,070
Is it that boy?

76
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,590
Be careful.

77
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,790
Besides the symptoms,

78
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,909
this little beggar's age

79
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,370
is the same as Yu Caizhe's.

80
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,590
Plus, he was also kidnapped when he was younger,

81
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,050
which was related to the River God Festival.

82
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,150
I guess

83
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,390
after he was abducted as a baby,

84
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,990
those bad people resented him for his poor health,

85
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,670
so they beat him till he was disabled,

86
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,930
and made him beg for money on the streets.

87
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,170
The son you've been missing day and night

88
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,400
is actually someone you come across every day.

89
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
Are you okay?

90
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,150
Are you really my son?

91
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,830
Are you really my son?

92
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,830
Dry weather! Beware of fire!

93
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,410
(Ancestral Shrine)

94
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,760
(Yingcai High School
Certificate of Merit)

95
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,070
Has something bad happened?

96
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,230
What's destined to happen will happen.

97
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,110
Lingling, are you there?

98
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,510
Ling Jiushi,

99
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,030
when you successfully solve a door challenge on your own,

100
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,750
this NPC would be activated.

101
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,830
This is a program I've set up particularly for you.

102
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,790
How come this voice sounds so familiar?

103
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,830
It's Gao Dawei!

104
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
Who is Gao Dawei?

105
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,150
Is he a master of this game too?

106
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,610
So there's a hidden enemy?

107
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,910
Will we be able to defeat him?

108
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,030
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,070
Without your consent,

110
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,870
I brought this game into your life.

111
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,670
Has that little dorm room

112
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,790
reminded you of

113
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,480
me being abducted?

114
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,790
You saved me.

115
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,950
I've always found your kindness admirable.

116
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,680
It's opened!

117
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,590
I think you can save a lot of lives,

118
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,750
not only mine.

119
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,270
I believe what happened six years ago

120
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,190
was just an accident,

121
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,470
but I've never got a chance to tell you that.

122
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,370
(Six years ago)

123
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,670
Jiushi, are you in the room?

124
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,440
On the day I left school,

125
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,000
I went to say goodbye to you.

126
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,520
I meant to have a nice talk with you,

127
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,310
but you shunned me.

128
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,030
I didn't have the courage to wake you up.

129
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,830
Take care,

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Jiushi.

131
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,880
After that incident six years ago,

132
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,950
we've drifted apart.

133
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,670
But in my heart,

134
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,710
you're always my best friend

135
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,910
since childhood.

136
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,390
Three years ago, upon graduation,

137
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,990
I had an opportunity to work in America.

138
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,470
I wanted to bid you farewell,

139
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,590
but

140
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,710
as usual,

141
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,290
I didn't get to see you.

142
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,190
Maybe time is the best cure.

143
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,400
Perhaps our friendship has ended up being forgotten by you.

144
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,750
Or perhaps you've finally dropped the grudge against me.

145
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,940
The advanced technology in America

146
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,350
gave me a chance to finally

147
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,390
realize our shared dream,

148
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,460
namely the pursuit of virtual reality technology.

149
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,030
Over three decades ago,

150
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,550
some scientists in our country already

151
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,790
presented the Spi Realm concept based on virtual reality technology,

152
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,470
but due to a lack of an ideal scientific research environment,

153
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,400
they couldn't further explore it.

154
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,350
It took me three years of research

155
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,080
to finally make a huge breakthrough

156
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,880
in virtual reality technology.

157
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,590
At long last, I had

158
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,470
a chance to make our shared dream come true,

159
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,720
which meant to create a real Spi Realm.

160
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,750
But I was wrong.

161
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,030
Do you remember

162
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,950
that in the Chinese myths we read when we were little,

163
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,470
there are the Blue Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise?

164
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,430
I developed a game based on these elements.

165
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,590
But everything in America

166
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,960
comes with a price tag.

167
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,950
My employers tampered with my contract.

168
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,110
The copyright of the game I developed

169
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,590
actually fell into the clutches of the company.

170
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,870
In order to yield profits, those capitalists in America

171
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,720
covered the source code I designed

172
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,190
on my technical source code.

173
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,590
and sexual content, etc.

174
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,790
It then became toxic to young minds,

175
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,520
and known as a game with 12 door challenges called the Spi Realm.

176
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,040
It didn't occur to me

177
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,520
that I would change the world in such a way.

178
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,350
To undo the harm,

179
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,390
I sneaked into the company's computer lab,

180
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,790
with an attempt to purge the game of all that bad stuff.

181
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,120
What I didn't expect was

182
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,030
that they had encrypted the game.

183
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,270
I failed to crack it,

184
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,230
so I had to add a Trojan program

185
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,510
to lock the 12th door,

186
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,630
as a way to prevent players from finishing all the challenges,

187
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,290
and to stop the company from launching the game.

188
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,230
I knew they'd eventually rid the game of my Trojan program,

189
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,590
and that I had to race against time and them.

190
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,110
A national investigation agency in America

191
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,430
has noticed me.

192
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,150
Over the past year, I've been hiding myself.

193
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,590
As the main server of the game

194
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,720
has stopped being updated,

195
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,070
I've planned to use that time to rectify the content.

196
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,070
However,

197
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,790
they've been updating their encryption program at the same time.

198
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,390
This task has become a long haul.

199
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,790
So I've thought of you.

200
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,530
You once saved my life,

201
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,030
and I believe you can do it again now.

202
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,550
That's why I've sent you a parcel in advance

203
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,950
to let you play this game.

204
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm sorry, but I don't really have another option.

205
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,950
The Trojan program I've set up

206
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,950
would recreate many scenarios

207
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,360
about your life.

208
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,630
For example, in all the door challenges,

209
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,290
there are kaleidoscopes that you liked as a kid.

210
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,350
Other examples include Jiu's origins,

211
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,750
and our dorm room in college.

212
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,510
All of these are telling you in a subtle way

213
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,510
that this game is closely connected to you.

214
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,070
Being unable to elaborate on the whole story in the game,

215
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,310
I had to create this NPC

216
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,270
to tell you the truth.

217
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,230
I'm sorry for depriving you of the right to choose,

218
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,790
but I really need you.

219
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,550
How do you want me to help you?

220
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,390
Find a way to finish the game.

221
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,350
When you take the 12th challenge,

222
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,680
you'll find the program I left there to correct the content.

223
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,590
What's the clue?

224
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,160
The flower in the water and the moon in the mirror.

225
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,330
The flower in the water and the moon in the mirror...

226
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,210
The flower in the water and the moon in the mirror...

227
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,830
Aren't the positions of "flower" and "moon" usually switched?

228
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,390
There's no time for this topic.

229
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,250
Let's hurry up and get out of here.

230
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,990
Ling Jiushi,

231
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,360
I've never expected

232
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,310
this game to be really related to you.

233
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm a bit excited now.

234
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,430
Let's go!

235
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,590
Don't you know that calling players by their real names

236
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,650
in a door challenge is a strict no-no?

237
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,650
Now open the exit door.

238
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,870
Yu Meng!

239
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,530
It turns out that you're Ling Jiushi.

240
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,350
I thought I wouldn't meet anyone

241
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,680
from the Obsidian in this door challenge.

242
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,950
You should die!

243
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm gonna kill you!

244
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,390
Yan Shihe, you...

245
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,590
Yu Meng!

246
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,950
Yu Meng.

247
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,670
Yu Meng,

248
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,000
how are you feeling?

249
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,590
I've been stabbed.

250
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,990
You're in charge now.

251
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,050
I'll take you home.

252
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,790
Let's go!

253
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,430
Hang in there.

254
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,530
Open the exit door!

255
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,310
Go!

256
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,750
Hurry!

257
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,790
Give it to me!

258
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,869
Get lost!

259
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Bad news!

260
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,310
Li Dongyuan had an accident!

261
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,510
What do you mean?

262
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,720
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,190
You're acting so rude

264
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,590
when you come to my house.

265
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Come in.

266
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,230
Zhuang.

267
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
We have guests.

268
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,920
Go get them some drinks.

269
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,430
OK.

270
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,710
Don't stand there. Sit down.

271
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,830
Are you okay?

272
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,310
How can I be okay?

273
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,720
I've been depressed
since I played this stupid game.

274
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,430
Some are feeling low.

275
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,390
And others are mentally ill.

276
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,010
I think I have a weak heart.

277
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,110
I guess

278
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,910
I would have a sudden cardiac death.

279
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,780
Then why are you

280
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,870
so calm?

281
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,670
Am I calm?

282
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm not!

283
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,910
I'm telling you, I'm so scared.

284
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,520
Actually, I'm afraid of death so much.

285
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,670
But

286
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,070
when death really comes,

287
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm not that scared.

288
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,130
How should I put this feeling?

289
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,630
I hope you never feel it.

290
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,630
After all,

291
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,390
we are brothers.

292
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,990
You drove here.

293
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,710
Don't drink.

294
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,230
Li Dongyuan.

295
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,480
Are you addicted to protecting me?

296
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,590
I got asked to,

297
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,950
and I have to make it.

298
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,110
It's nice to meet you.

299
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,070
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,990
I do blame you.

301
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,590
I'm going to die.

302
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,630
Can't you wear white today

303
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,520
and say goodbye to me
on behalf of Ruan Baijie?

304
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,710
Fine.

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,060
Let's have a drink.

306
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,390
In the past,

307
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,430
I thought you were my best opponent.

308
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,790
I hope we can

309
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,430
be best friends if possible.

310
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,190
I have something to do later.

311
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,030
I won't keep you.

312
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,470
Go back early.

313
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,230
Go home.

314
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,830
Since I played this stupid game,

315
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,400
I've been wallowing my entire life.

316
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,820
Can you leave me alone

317
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,760
to spend the rest of my life?

318
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,680
Let's go, Lingling.

319
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,030
Let me stay with you.

320
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,600
I know you don't need me.

321
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,270
But I want to stay with you.

322
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,630
Please.

323
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,390
Okay.

324
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,680
Let's send them off.

325
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,590
Okay.

326
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,830
It's fine.

327
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,130
Let's send them out first.

328
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Let's go.

329
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,190
You are still here.

330
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,790
Go back and rest.

331
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Zhuang Rujiao.

332
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,430
I'll leave the White Deer to you.

333
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,790
What do you mean?

334
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,220
What do you mean by
leaving the White Deer to me?

335
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Li Dongyuan!

336
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Li Dongyuan!

337
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,790
Open the door!

338
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,670
You promised me!

339
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,590
You promised me.

340
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,710
Open the door!

341
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,000
You promised me!

342
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,230
You promised me.

343
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,910
You said

344
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,790
I could stay with you.

345
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,350
You said it!

346
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,190
Li Dongyuan.

347
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,670
Open the door!

348
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,070
Open the door.

349
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,790
Open the door.

350
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
You promised me.

351
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,830
You promised me that I could stay with you.

352
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,410
♫Be worth 10,000 light years♫

353
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,510
♫You're on the other side♫

354
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,800
♫About to disappear♫

355
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,100
♫Please stop counting down the time♫

356
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,560
♫I'm afraid I'll do anything♫

357
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,920
♫I won't give up♫

358
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:06,910
♫Want to return to the end of the world♫

359
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,550
♫You will always be in my eyes♫

360
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:22,210
♫Until the night and day blur♫

361
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,150
Enter a door with Ling Jiushi for me.

362
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,630
The third door.

363
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,630
That's it?

364
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,710
Lanzhu.

365
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,390
Ruan.

366
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,990
They say you're not easy to get along with.

367
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,990
I don't think so.

368
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,950
Your condition

369
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,470
is so easy to meet.

370
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,570
I don't like Ruan Baijie anymore.

371
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,990
I like you now.

372
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,790
Shut up.

373
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,230
By the way,

374
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,550
keep this a secret.

375
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,840
Don't tell Ling Jiushi.

376
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,450
We didn't say anything today.

377
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,790
I just came to see you.

378
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,590
Take care.

379
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,010
Looks like they are prepared.

380
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,310
Xiong Qi.

381
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,550
Xiong.

382
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,550
Let's go.

383
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,590
I put on a clean dressing. Please rest well.

384
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,830
You saved me.

385
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,600
You need to look for Yan Balang.

386
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,990
Yan Balang.

387
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,300
Is that his real name?

388
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,750
Who knows?

389
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,790
What he gave us were all fake,

390
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,790
except the money.

391
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,110
He came back from America.

392
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,230
With the money from America,

393
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,790
he wants to localize the Spi Realm

394
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,480
into Chinese,

395
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,190
and form a team.

396
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,760
Li Dongyuan is dead.

397
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,510
Yan Shihe did it.

398
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,270
Yan Shihe.

399
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,070
He's a crappy player.

400
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,070
How can he harm the Boss of White Deer?

401
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,070
Li Dongyuan did it

402
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,430
to protect me.

403
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,350
Well,

404
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,670
you want to find Yan Shihe?

405
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,530
We not only want to find Yan Shihe,

406
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,000
but also Yan Balang.

407
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,320
We can't let more people die for it.

408
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,820
I have a falling out with them.

409
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,270
I can't contact them now.

410
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,710
What's going on

411
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,710
with your organization?

412
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,040
Actually, I joined a long time ago.

413
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,780
Yan Balang told us

414
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,430
he wanted to form a world-class

415
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,830
player team.

416
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
But later,

417
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,270
I gradually found

418
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,630
that many Chinese versions of this game

419
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,590
got out from him.

420
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,310
Ke

421
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,920
got stuck in the game

422
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,430
because of him.

423
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,400
His only goal is

424
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,310
to incite more people to finish this game

425
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,830
to find more secrets and details in it.

426
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,470
In this way,

427
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,000
he can plagiarize

428
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
and replicate this game.

429
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,150
Recently, he has been crazy.

430
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,310
There must be a problem with money.

431
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,550
The capital behind him put pressure on him.

432
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,150
He couldn't take it anymore.

433
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,670
So gradually,

434
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,790
he did whatever he had to do.

435
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,390
So,

436
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,030
you quit because you didn't want to cooperate.

437
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,790
I've always been loyal,

438
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,970
and wanted to recruit you for him.

439
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,150
I went to argue with Xia.

440
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,950
They were about to evacuate.

441
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,270
We disagreed

442
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,550
and they attacked me.

443
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,950
Xia?

444
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
She's better than me.

445
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,070
She has passed ten doors.

446
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,190
(Qianli)

447
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,270
Hello.

448
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,560
Hello, Lingling, your friend is here.

449
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,630
Friend?

450
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
Yes.

451
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,270
Okay.

452
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,470
I'll be back soon.

453
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,120
You take a rest here.

454
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,790
Tell me if you need anything.

455
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,390
Okay.

456
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,190
We're leaving.

457
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,790
Lingling.

458
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,990
Meng Yu...

459
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
I'm sorry.

460
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,910
I'm really sorry.

461
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,920
I was careless.

462
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,030
Wu Qi.

463
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,610
I hope you can remember his name forever.

464
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,710
Li Dongyuan.

465
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,670
Something happened in the door.

466
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,710
I have to tell you.

467
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,920
The flower in the water and the moon in the mirror.

468
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,429
So this game was made by your friend.

469
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,270
He needs you to help him

470
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,710
to return the game to the original version.

471
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,010
This original version

472
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,190
is your dream when you were young.

473
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,310
Yes.

474
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,590
His name is Gao Dawei.

475
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,310
We were

476
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,230
best friends.

477
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,110
You've said it for so many years.

478
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,110
Have you changed?

479
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:06,950
Divorce!

480
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,760
Don't come back if you dare.

481
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,990
I have so many businesses.

482
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,230
Can I handle it alone?

483
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,350
You can't?

484
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,230
I have to take care of our family.

485
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,110
You just cooked meals, what else can you do?

486
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,750
I don't want to live with you anymore.

487
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,750
Let's divorce.

488
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
It's fine.

489
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,630
We grew up in the same neighborhood.

490
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,950
Our parents divorced

491
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,790
and we were abandoned.

492
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,230
We were all lonely children.

493
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,510
In high school,

494
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,590
we learned about virtual reality technology.

495
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,710
Thirty years ago,

496
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,310
a Chinese scientist

497
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,290
has come up with a similar idea

498
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,050
and named it the Spi Realm.

499
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,680
We don't know the concept of the new world.

500
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,390
When we learned

501
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,790
that the virtual reality technology

502
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,250
can make virtual parents,

503
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,870
we made up our mind

504
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,550
to have our own parents with this.

505
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,510
Even if they're virtual.

506
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,830
We chose science together

507
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,320
and got into the best college in automation control.

508
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,790
We want to achieve our dreams together.

509
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,120
But that didn't happen.

510
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,910
In the first year,

511
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,350
something happened

512
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,960
that changed everything.

513
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,150
Do you remember

514
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,350
the daughter of the Madam

515
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,760
when we passed the first door?

516
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,640
I can empathize with

517
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,550
her fate.

518
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,950
Jiushi.

519
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,350
Jiushi.

520
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,950
I'm here.

521
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,950
Jiushi.

522
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Jiushi.

523
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,200
Where did you hurt?

524
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,390
I'll help you get out.

525
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,070
When I was a freshman,

526
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,470
he and I went to the southwestern provinces

527
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,330
to collect data for the Spi Realm.

528
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,140
Unfortunately,

529
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,910
we encountered an earthquake,

530
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,190
and I got buried.

531
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,670
Hold on,

532
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,390
I'll go get help.

533
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,990
Is anyone there?

534
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,910
Help!

535
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,080
But at the same time,

536
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,510
I heard many people calling for help.

537
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,030
Jiushi,

538
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,190
hold on. I'll go check.

539
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,310
Jiushi,

540
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,140
wait for me. I'll be back soon.

541
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,710
He chose to save more lives

542
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,150
between those people and me.

543
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,440
I understood his decision.

544
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
If it were me,

545
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,090
I would have made the same choice.

546
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,440
When we returned to school,

547
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,290
he became a hero for saving lives,

548
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,810
while I turned into

549
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,180
a troublemaker.

550
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,570
I couldn't face such a change.

551
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,150
Gradually,

552
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,670
there arose a rift between us.

553
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,350
We went from being best friends who shared everything

554
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,880
to becoming strangers passing by each other.

555
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,110
Jiushi, are you there?

556
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,660
I'm about to go abroad.

557
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,360
I just wanted to say goodbye to you.

558
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,130
After graduation,

559
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,710
I learned that

560
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,310
(The World of the Spi Realm)

561
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,150
he got a great job.

562
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,370
He came to bid me farewell,

563
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,870
but I didn't have the courage

564
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,430
to say goodbye to him.

565
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,590
In fact, I thought about reaching out to him,

566
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,920
but he was already gone.

567
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,350
Whether we stay in touch or not doesn't really matter now.

568
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
This might be

569
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,430
a way for me to escape.

570
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,270
Though it's shameful,

571
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,430
it really works.

572
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,670
So

573
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,270
it's that he got you involved in this game.

574
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,040
Wasn't he causing you harm?

575
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,430
Anyway, if anything happens to me,

576
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,910
I definitely wouldn't bring my brother along.

577
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,110
I knew he was torn,

578
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,420
but the fact that he thought of me when he was most helpless

579
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,290
showed that he truly considersed me a good brother.

580
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,870
Maybe it's because I'm too young

581
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,130
to understand this level of complexity.

582
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,150
But Lingling,

583
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,550
you are truly kind.

584
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,190
you are truly kind.

585
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,250
So, are you going to

586
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,470
agree to his request

587
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,190
to pass the 12th door?
