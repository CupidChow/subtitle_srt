00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,390
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,980
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,630
So, are you going to

4
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,850
agree to his request

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
to pass the 12th door?

6
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,890
Isn't it perfect?

7
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,330
Originally,

8
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,840
I was supposed to accompany you,

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,289
but now it seems like

10
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,289
you'll pass the 12th door

11
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,289
with me.

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I always thought you had the talent for passing doors,

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,740
but I didn't expect it to be like this.

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,690
Anyway, no matter what,

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,360
we now have more important clues.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,900
Flowers in the water, the Moon in the mirror.

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Well...

18
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
I knew that tommorrow is Meng...

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,890
Li Dongyuan's funeral.

20
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,250
Let's go and send him off.

21
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,130
Let him leave quietly.

22
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,570
Some go with the wind,

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,579
some enter dreams,

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
and some

25
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,220
linger in the heart.

26
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,690
I used to find him a bit annoying,

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
but now,

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,770
I do feel a bit nostalgic.

29
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,240
Now there's one more

30
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,950
person to keep in mind.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,880
Zhuang, what are you doing here?

32
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,910
Unexpectedly, you just joined Obsidian

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,450
right after Li died.

34
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,200
You can join them,

35
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,770
but leave Li's belongings.

36
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,230
If it weren't for you guys,

37
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,290
would I come here?

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,450
Have you ever thought about

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,780
how Li treated you when he was still alive?

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,810
You're all displaying ingratitude.

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,670
What are you waiting for? Grab it!

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
Ruan, help!

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,960
Let go!

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,970
Ruan.

45
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,090
Causing trouble in Obsidian so late at night,

46
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,350
are you in a hurry to die

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,810
or are you rushing to be reincarnated?

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,810
Ruan,

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,900
this is an internal matter of our White Deer.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,320
I don't care if the White Deer has private matters or not.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Zhuang Rujiao is my guest tonight.

52
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,570
Inviting guests so late?

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,490
Do I need your consent

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,970
on when to invite guests?

55
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,810
Let's go.

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,130
Tomorrow is Li Dongyuan's funeral.

57
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,159
They started to act up

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
as soon as he died.

59
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,040
They can't hold back anymore.

60
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,780
They wanted to take over the White Deer

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,930
and snatch Li 's box.

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I cannot give

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
the White Deer to them.

64
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,130
And this box,

65
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,260
I won't give it to them even if I die.

66
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,550
What exactly is in this box

67
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,100
that made them so eager?

68
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,070
Is it a note for entering the door?

69
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,490
The Spi Realm harms people,

70
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,880
and many innocent lives

71
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,570
have been lost.

72
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,570
Over the years, most of the

73
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,500
money that Li earned

74
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,950
went to the families of these people.

75
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Li often said that

76
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,530
This game harmed people.

77
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,110
Since we can't destroy it,

78
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,970
why not

79
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
do something for their families in the end?

80
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,430
The world Inside and outside the door

81
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,850
is indeed different,

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
but there must be one that is real.

83
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,260
Since there is no notes in this box,

84
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,530
why they still relentlessly pursued it?

85
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,880
I explained to them,

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,110
but they didn't believe me at all.

87
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,970
They thought

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,570
I hid Li's notes.

89
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,530
Now, without a leader,

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,240
they are using the name of White Deer to bring people to pass the door.

91
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,010
For them,

92
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
finding the notes and clues

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
to the high-level door

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
is undoubtedly

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
a great temptation.

96
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,790
It seems that the White Deer has already disbanded.

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
What about you?

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
What do you plan to do?

99
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,870
Why not come to join us?

100
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,990
You'll have some support.

101
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,010
No.

102
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,030
The White Deer

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,250
is Li's hard work.

104
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,090
Even if I die,

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,540
I will die with the White Deer.

106
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,690
OK.

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
I see.

108
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,170
I can't help you for too long.

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,340
I can only assist you this time.

110
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,200
She's just a player who has passed only five doors.

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,320
What qualifications does she have to lead the White Deer?

112
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Besides,

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,810
her own ability to enter and exit doors

114
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,920
is uncertain.

115
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,090
If she leads the White Deer,

116
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,010
who would dare to approach us for passing the door?

117
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,210
What if I insist on it?

118
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,130
Then, I'll insist too.

119
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,370
You...

120
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,210
What if

121
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,930
I think she's very suitable?

122
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,450
Ruan,

123
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,880
you are not a member of our White Deer.

124
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,850
Your opinion on her suitability

125
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,770
doesn't matter.

126
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,780
There are five notes here,

127
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,050
three for the eighth door

128
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,550
and two for the ninth door.

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,450
Except for Li Dongyuan,

130
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,590
none of you from the White Deer

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,330
has passed the eighth door, right?

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
By the way,

133
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
tomorrow is Li Dongyuan's funeral.

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
What a pity.

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,390
Instead of preparing to send him off,

136
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,200
you were here dividing.

137
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,940
This is the clue for the ninth door.

138
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,250
Li Dongyuan died because of me.

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,460
Considering this as my mourning for him.

140
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,640
You should always remember him,

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
whether he is present

142
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,090
or not,

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
we should all do the same.

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Zhuang,

145
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll give you

146
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,130
these four notes

147
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
as a gift for taking over the White Deer,

148
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
but I'll keep them with me first.

149
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,400
There's only one clue left for the ninth door,

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
very precious.

151
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,340
If any member of your White Deer needs anything,

152
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,110
feel free to come to me.

153
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,730
Now,

154
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,880
does Zhuang Rujiao have the qualifications

155
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,940
to be the new leader of the White Deer?

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,250
Since Ruan supports her,

157
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,970
the three of us

158
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,820
naturally have no objections.

159
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,800
Initially, we just thought she was young

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,930
and inexperienced,

161
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,970
but now, there's no problem.

162
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,610
I wholeheartedly agree.

163
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,850
We agree too.

164
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,380
It's getting late.

165
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,370
Let's stop here.

166
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Ruan,

167
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
thank you.

168
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Don't worry.

169
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,070
We will avenge Li Dongyuan

170
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,690
and expose the X organization.

171
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,940
You stay here tonight.

172
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,890
I won't stay.

173
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,090
There's still a lot to prepare

174
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,770
for Li's funeral.

175
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,550
Then, sit here for a while.

176
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm afraid they haven't gone far.

177
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm worried...

178
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,750
(Xiong Qi)

179
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,530
Hello, Xiong. What's up?

180
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,860
I have some clues to share with you.

181
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,640
OK, I'll be right there.

182
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,160
Lingling, you go first.

183
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,730
I'll leave after a while.

184
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Take care.

185
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,170
Xiong,

186
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,520
your injury hasn't healed,

187
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,250
why rush to leave the hospital?

188
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,320
Things haven't been clarified yet.

189
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,980
I can't stay put for even a day.

190
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,460
Did you find Yan Balang?

191
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,140
If he's willing to talk,

192
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I'd prefer

193
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,450
a direct and straightforward conversation.

194
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,110
A wary hare has three burrows.

195
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,340
I haven't located him yet,

196
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,040
but I got reliable information.

197
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,890
It's said that someone named Lin Xingping

198
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,760
is about to enter the third door.

199
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
She entrusted a man named Cui Xueyi

200
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
to lead her past the door.

201
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,280
Cui Xueyi

202
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,080
claimed to be from the X organization.

203
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,690
Do you know Cui Xueyi?

204
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,930
I don't know him.

205
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
But I know

206
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,130
he's a veteran,

207
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,370
having entered many doors.

208
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
One thing is certain,

209
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,450
he is definitely connected to the X organization.

210
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,450
So, is there any news from Yan Shihe?

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,240
Yan Shihe and Xia,

212
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,260
behaving as rascals together,

213
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,250
employing similarly despicable means,

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,280
are hard to find.

215
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
It's okay.

216
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,050
As long as we find Yan Balang,

217
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,570
we can locate Yan Shihe.

218
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,450
Let's go meet

219
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Cui Xueyi.

220
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,950
Where are we going?

221
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,560
Who should we

222
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,370
we find now?

223
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,600
They don't tell me

224
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,260
the information in the real world.

225
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,450
There are rules.

226
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
If you can't find it outside the door,

227
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,740
then just look for it inside the door.

228
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,680
I won't be able to enter the door

229
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
during this period.

230
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,810
If you happen to see Ke inside the door,

231
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,310
please take care of her for me.

232
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,690
OK.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,440
(Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror)

234
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,460
What kind of nonsense clue is this?

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,570
Clearly, we're all science majors.

236
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,810
Gao Dawei, why did you give me these poems?

237
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,560
Who can understand this?

238
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,640
What was he up to?

239
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Lingling.

240
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,060
What are you looking at?

241
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,270
Flowers in water, the Moon in the mirror,

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,840
aren't they all reflections?

243
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,240
Why bother writing so much? Did you make a mistake?

244
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,210
What is this?

245
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,850
Qianli,

246
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,530
It's time to walk Toast.

247
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,250
I'll go later.

248
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,440
I want to help you find some information.

249
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,770
What are you doing here?

250
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,260
I'm helping Lingling find some information.

251
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,580
The more you help, the busier he gets.

252
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,560
You should go out first.

253
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
I had something

254
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,010
to talk to Lingling.

255
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,370
What is it?

256
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,530
Can I help?

257
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,930
You go ahead.

258
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
If you need my help, just let me know.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,730
We've found the clue to the door

260
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,200
Lin Xingping wanted to enter.

261
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
The Cleaning Lady

262
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,330
is a low-level door.

263
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,170
We've already entered an advanced door.

264
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,030
Can we still enter the third door?

265
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,570
I'll entrust this matter to Zhuang RuJiao.

266
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,650
Members of the White Deer haven't passed high-level doors.

267
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,590
They can take us in.

268
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,760
The Cleaning Lady?

269
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,930
Let me check.

270
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,540
(The Cleaning Lady)

271
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,890
I saw

272
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,680
the Cleaning Lady legend

273
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,610
in a foreign cartoon when I was a kid.

274
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,990
It

275
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,970
appeared in the Yuan Dynasty.

276
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,970
At that time,

277
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,970
people would hang a paper-cut woman

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,230
on the eaves

279
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,120
to pray for the rain to stop and the sky to clear.

280
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,700
It's usually cut from green or red paper.

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,170
Because the woman holds a broom,

282
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,520
she's called Cleaning Lady.

283
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,010
(Folk Story: The Cleaning Lady)

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
There's another story here that

285
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,050
tells of a village experiencing continuous rainfall,

286
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,910
facing a potential crop failure.

287
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,280
The ignorant villagers

288
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
heard of a way:

289
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,530
chopping off a man's head and hanging it in the courtyard

290
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,450
would make the torrential rain stop.

291
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,890
Believing this, the villagers

292
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,530
selected a kid for sacrifice.

293
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,010
The village tutor

294
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,210
tried to dissuade them,

295
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,300
explaining that

296
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,690
the village, situated by the mountains and the sea, naturally received abundant rainfall.

297
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,530
The villagers didn't listen

298
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,090
and insisted on sacrificing the kids.

299
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,810
The village tutor also insisted on sacrificing himself for the students.

300
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,850
The ignorant villagers

301
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,170
wrapped the tutor's head in white cloth

302
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,920
and hung it high,

303
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,620
and unexpectedly, the heavy rain immediately stopped.

304
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,970
This... This is too superstitious, isn't it?

305
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,570
Gao Dawei is a science major.

306
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,810
And

307
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,420
this game was modified by magic overseas.

308
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,380
Does this have anything to do with the Cleaning Lady?

309
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,570
A science major

310
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,610
generally wouldn't be interested in folklore.

311
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,760
Foreign game developers

312
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,840
wouldn't know Chinese culture too well either,

313
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,080
so like us,

314
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
they rely on the internet for research.

315
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,590
So, it means that people overseas

316
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,040
might also come across this story,

317
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,530
and the situation inside the door would be more or less the same.

318
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,530
I think so.

319
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
After all, it's a lower-level door.

320
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,000
When are we entering the door?

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Today.

322
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
Lingling,

323
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,050
this brooch is quite exquisite.

324
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,119
You like this kind of thing now?

325
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,450
This is the prop that White Deer uses to take people to enter the doors,

326
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,650
just like the bracelet of our Obsidian.

327
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,770
I heard that Ruan is now involved in the management of White Deer.

328
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,430
He didn't used to be like this.

329
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
He used to always turn a blind eye to everything.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,130
Has he changed a lot?

331
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,680
Since you came,

332
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,050
he has indeed changed a lot.

333
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,610
It's coming.

334
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,320
I'll enter the door first.

335
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,160
Let's talk later.

336
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Okay.

337
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,210
Hello.

338
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm Lin Sen.

339
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,040
It's my third time entering.

340
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm Yun Shan.

341
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,700
It's my fourth time.

342
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,410
Judging from the decoration,

343
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,290
it should be around the Ming Dynasty.

344
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,290
Probably.

345
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,600
Hello, I'm Wang Di.

346
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,690
I'm from Zhuang's group.

347
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,490
How many people from White Deer entered in total this time?

348
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,290
Do you need my help?

349
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,820
I have two partners with me.

350
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,050
We'll support each other to pass the door.

351
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,050
Don't worry.

352
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,030
We can take care of ourselves.

353
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,380
If we find any clues to the key,

354
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
I'll let you know.

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,130
Thank you.

356
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,490
I'm Yun Shan.

357
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,010
It's my fourth time entering.

358
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,140
Thank you, Yun Shan.

359
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,760
Hello, everyone.

360
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,950
I'm Lin Xingping, it's my third time door-passing.

361
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,600
When I get the key,

362
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,680
I'll see how you guys will beg me.

363
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,770
She's quite confident.

364
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Hello.

365
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,500
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu...

366
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,050
Cui Xueyi.

367
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,090
It's my fifth time door-passing.

368
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,090
This is my cousin.

369
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,320
He's a mute.

370
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,360
Just like my girlfriend,

371
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,970
it's his third time door-passing.

372
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,970
Nice to meet you.

373
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,190
They are passing the door as a group.

374
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,730
Yes.

375
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,220
Why is there a mute playing this game?

376
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,090
Who said

377
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,620
a mute can't play this game?

378
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,580
That's not what I meant.

379
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,500
Is that Cui Xueyi the person Xiong has mentioned?

380
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,330
Judging by his appearance,

381
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,610
he doesn't look like a person who has passed the fifth door.

382
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,410
Let's find a chance to probe him.

383
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Handsome.

384
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,090
You've just entered the door, right?

385
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,690
Let's get to know each other.

386
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,130
Why should I?

387
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,890
I just want to know a new friend.

388
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,090
I have a secret weapon.

389
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,620
I will bring you benefits if you follow me.

390
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,410
Secret weapon?

391
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,870
Tell me about it.

392
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,220
Let's see if you're worthy to be my friend.

393
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,440
No man has dared to talk to me like this.

394
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
There's one now.

395
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,170
Let's go.

396
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:04,520
You... I...

397
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,120
It's okay.

398
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,760
How could he talk to me like that?

399
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,330
It's okay. Just ignore him.

400
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,130
I've never seen anyone like you.

401
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,590
The two people that Cui Xueyi brought...

402
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,190
One is arrogant, and the other one is disabled.

403
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,730
It's not easy for them to get out.

404
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,960
It seems that Yan Balang is really facing a break in his cash flow.

405
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,620
He dares to accept any client.

406
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,970
Welcome to visit here, everyone.

407
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
This courtyard

408
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
is where you will be staying.

409
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,320
The town has a lot of beautiful scenery.

410
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,590
You can go and visit these places.

411
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,450
However,

412
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,200
it rains a lot here.

413
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
So when you go out,

414
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,380
make sure to bring an umbrella.

415
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,240
There are a total of 11 of you.

416
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
The keys are on the table.

417
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,560
You can allocate rooms yourselves.

418
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,450
Alright,

419
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,430
feel free to make yourselves at home.

420
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,720
Do you think that is made of thread?

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,530
Hey.

422
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,960
Wang Ronghua, what are you doing?

423
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Look at this.

424
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,560
It's just a piece of ordinary cloth.

425
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,120
The NPC just told us not to get wet.

426
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,180
What's the problem with it?

427
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,040
It's not like we'll die if we get wet.

428
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,800
Nan, you are so timid.

429
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm not timid.

430
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,920
Is this it?

431
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,010
I think so.

432
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,130
A kaleidoscope.

433
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
It seems that there is this little thing in every door.

434
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,670
I didn't notice it before.

435
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,850
Now I realize

436
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,900
that it's actually a hint for you.

437
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,540
Too many hints have made me unsure of the answer.

438
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,090
The person who got wet just now,

439
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,090
will he be okay?

440
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,290
The NPC advised us

441
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,080
to always bring an umbrella when going out.

442
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,250
Literally, it means not to get caught in the rain.

443
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,280
But he didn't explicitly say not to get caught in the rain.

444
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,340
So I don't know yet.

445
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,120
Asking us to bring umbrellas but not providing them.

446
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,970
He was meant to mess with our mindset.

447
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,880
Let's wait a bit longer.

448
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,340
There must be other clues.

449
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,060
About Cui Xueyi...

450
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,910
should we try to probe him?

451
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
I'll go with you.

452
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,690
This place is too shabby.

453
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
Since I was born,

454
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,200
I've never lived in such a lousy room.

455
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,370
How can I sleep at night?

456
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,280
It's okay, honey. Let's just endure it for a few more days.

457
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,400
Once we pass the door,

458
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,170
I'll take you to the Burj Al Arab in Dubai,

459
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,170
alright?

460
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,960
You're so old-fashioned.

461
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,240
Going there has become a cliché.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,370
I'm not going there.

463
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,120
I want to go to Norway to enjoy the aurora.

464
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Okay!

465
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Why did you hit me?

466
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,040
Let's go to Norway to enjoy the aurora then.

467
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Okay, enough.

468
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,240
Stop saying useless things.

469
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,060
Let's look for umbrellas.

470
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Hello.

471
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,110
Your name is Cui Xueyi, right?

472
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Yes.

473
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,250
Who are you?

474
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,870
My name is Yun Shan.

475
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,330
He is Lin Sen.

476
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,210
We have only passed a few doors.

477
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,040
I heard that you've passed five doors.

478
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,250
Yes, that's right.

479
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,690
Impressive.

480
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,730
Hey.

481
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,360
Why are you two here?

482
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,810
Earlier, you two ignored me.

483
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,090
Now you want to seek our help?

484
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
It's too late.

485
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,930
We have a favor to ask.

486
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,770
Can we switch rooms?

487
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Sure.

488
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
No.

489
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,790
I'm going to sleep.

490
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,370
You two should leave now.

491
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,390
Then let's not switch.

492
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,320
What do you mean exactly?

493
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,120
First, you asked Yuansi to impersonate your name,

494
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,560
and then you pretended to be mute.

495
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,840
What are you up to?

496
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,360
Those two are both experts.

497
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,610
Experts?

498
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,220
Isn't that perfect?

499
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,560
Let them lead us to find the key and pass the door.

500
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
I have money.

501
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,530
I'm afraid that you might be killed by them

502
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,240
before seeing the key.

503
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,240
This Cui Xueyi,

504
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,760
judging by his stupid expression,

505
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,410
doesn't seem like someone who has passed five doors,

506
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,740
not to mention a member of X organization.

507
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,130
He truly doesn't look like an experienced door-passer.

508
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,080
He showed no familiarity with door-passing.

509
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,810
He even lacks basic vigilance.

510
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,810
He agreed to switch rooms without hesitation,

511
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,340
not even afraid of any traps we might have set.

512
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,570
Could it be that the information from Xiong Qi is not accurate enough?

513
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,370
But I'd rather believe Xiong Qi.

514
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,810
If Cui Xueyi is not a real rookie,

515
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,090
then he's even more troublesome,

516
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,770
because he has been acting in front of us.

517
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,960
In the circle of door-passing,

518
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,480
those two have a bad reputation.

519
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,000
They specifically target rookies, making them take risks

520
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,660
and sacrificing themselves for their benefit.

521
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,840
I'm pretending to be mute

522
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,090
just to avoid attracting their attention,

523
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,090
understand?

524
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,280
But what if they want to kill me?

525
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,520
That's why

526
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,180
I asked you to impersonate me.

527
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,880
Once they know you've passed five doors

528
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,090
and are not a rookie,

529
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,410
they won't scheme against you.

530
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,410
Moreover,

531
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,730
you can divert their attention,

532
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,090
making it easier for me to search for the key.

533
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,480
Even if they find the key first,

534
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,250
I can snatch it away.

535
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,810
Cui, you're truly chivalrous.

536
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,490
Let's put that aside for now.

537
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,010
The situation has changed.

538
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,940
It has become even more dangerous.

539
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,220
You need to pay me more.

540
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,730
Simply put, he's not easy to deal with.

541
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,170
Yes.

542
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,160
Let's find the key to this door first.

543
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,330
Once we have the key,

544
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,850
they won't be able to hold back,

545
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,130
and by then, we should be able to find the answer.

546
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,130
You're right.

547
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,610
Get some rest.

548
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,250
Let's find clues tomorrow.

549
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,490
Drop the flag.

550
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,920
Drop the flag.

551
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,030
Softly behind your friend's back.

552
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,480
Everybody quiets down.

553
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,000
Quickly, quickly run around.

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,570
What's wrong?

555
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,360
Quickly, quickly run around.

556
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,610
It seems like a bunch of kids are singing outside.

557
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,250
I think I heard it too.

558
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,400
Drop the flag.

559
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,170
But I can't hear what they're singing clearly.

560
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,280
Drop the flag.

561
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
It's a nursery rhyme.

562
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,290
Shh.

563
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,410
Don't say it out loud for now.

564
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,680
I don't know what the use of this nursery rhyme is.

565
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,650
Type it out on the phone.

566
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,610
Everybody quiets down.

567
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Quickly, quickly run around.

568
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,890
(Drop the flag. Drop the flag. Softly behind your friend's back)

569
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,600
(Everybody quiets down. Quickly, quickly run around.)

570
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
Drop the flag.

571
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,610
Isn't this...

572
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,690
Drop the flag.

573
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,610
the game we played while singing the song when we were kids?

574
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,440
Softly behind your friend's back.

575
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,730
It reminds me

576
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,180
of the hint that Gao Dawei gave me.

577
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,090
Did you always play this game

578
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,450
when you were kids?

579
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,250
Quickly, quickly run around.

580
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,210
This game reminds me of my childhood.

581
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,730
Drop the flag. Drop the flag.

582
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,770
Softly behind your friend's back.

583
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,560
Everybody quiets down.

584
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,530
Quickly, quickly run around.

585
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,200
Quickly, quickly run around.

586
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,570
Stop playing.

587
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,730
It's time to eat.

588
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,920
It's time to eat!

589
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,760
It's time to eat!

590
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,200
Drop the flag.

591
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,760
Drop the flag.

592
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,250
Softly behind your friend's back.

593
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,440
I will ask someone to inquire about Gao Dawei.

594
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,760
Everybody quiets down.

595
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Thank you.

596
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,050
Quickly, quickly run around.

597
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,200
Quickly, quickly run around.

598
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,160
It's too noisy. They keep singing.

599
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,660
Shall we go out and have a look?

600
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,450
Drop the flag.

601
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,050
Never mind. It's quite weird.

602
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:42,600
Drop the flag.

603
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,430
Go to sleep.

604
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,290
Drop the flag.

605
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,810
Softly behind your friend's back.

606
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,330
Everybody quiets down.

607
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,210
Drop the flag.

608
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,130
Drop the flag.

609
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,410
Softly behind your friend's back.

610
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,050
Everybody quiets down.

611
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,490
Quickly, quickly run around.

612
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,370
Quickly, quickly run around.

613
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
I think the rain has stopped.

614
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,050
Morning.

615
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,720
Let's have some breakfast.

616
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,330
Let's go. I'm hungry too.

617
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,010
I'm hungry.

618
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,490
Eat the egg.

619
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,370
There's still one person not here.

620
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,500
Who hasn't come yet?

621
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,320
Is this person still sleeping at this hour?

622
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,960
Wang Ronghua, who lives with me,

623
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,130
is missing.

624
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,290
He went out last night

625
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,800
and hasn't come back.

626
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,810
Why didn't you mention this earlier?

627
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,130
Why wasn't he sleeping in the middle of the night

628
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,570
and instead wandering around?

629
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,640
I tried to stop him.

630
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,290
He didn't respond,

631
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,550
so I couldn't stop him.

632
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,730
Let's go and find Wang Ronghua.

633
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,730
Let's go.

634
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,260
Are we not going to have breakfast?

635
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,120
How about having two eggs?

636
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,199
Forget it.

637
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,650
What's this?

638
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,760
It's a Sunny Doll.

639
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,010
Why is it so big?

640
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,170
I just remembered, I twisted my arm

641
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,210
when I entered.

642
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,080
Can someone help me with this?

643
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,890
Well...

644
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,210
I'll do it.

645
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,850
You're afraid to touch that doll,

646
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,610
yet you're acting like this.

647
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,190
Who are you trying to fool?

648
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,540
It's none of your business.

649
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Alright, then.

650
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,670
If that's the case,

651
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,450
let's all not touch the doll.

652
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,490
After all, if we can't find the key,

653
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,690
I won't be the only one who can't get out.

654
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,280
So, why don't you go and take that doll down?

655
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,090
Let's not misunderstand each other.

656
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,570
We're on the same boat.

657
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,810
We should work together.

658
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,270
Come on.

659
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,800
Enough. Stop arguing.

660
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll do it.

661
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,800
Why is it so heavy?

662
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,730
Is there something in it?

663
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,770
I think I saw a head.

664
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,420
Did you see it clearly?

665
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,790
Don't talk nonsense.

666
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,580
Take a closer look.

667
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,810
Ronghua!

668
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,080
It's Ronghua's head!

669
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,000
Is it because of the rain?

670
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,930
Rain?

671
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,560
Let's go.

672
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,570
The red-haired woman is so cunning.

673
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,950
She's so pretentious.

674
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,840
We should be careful.

675
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,840
The cloth in Wang Ronghua's hand

676
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,170
is used to make the Sunny Doll.

677
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,540
So did he violate the taboo condition because of the rain

678
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,630
or because he touched this cloth?

679
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,350
It should be the rain.

680
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,890
Yesterday, the NPC repeatedly emphasized that

681
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,550
we mustn't get wet in the rain.

682
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,780
And the rain stopped

683
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,370
last night

684
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,340
probably because the Sunny Doll was hung up.

685
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,570
Now it's taken off

686
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,210
and it's not raining.

687
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,290
Do you remember

688
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,680
when we were looking for

689
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,010
information about the Sunny Doll before,

690
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,370
there was a chant about the Sunny Doll?

691
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,970
I saved it in my phone.

692
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,240
Sunny Doll.

693
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,490
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

694
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,640
Just like the sky in my dreams.

695
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,250
If it's sunny, I'll give you a golden bell.

696
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Sunny Doll.

697
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,260
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

698
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,170
If you listen to my wish,

699
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,210
I'll give you sweet wine to drink.

700
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,210
Sunny Doll.

701
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,170
May tomorrow's weather be clear.

702
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,570
If it's still

703
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,600
cloudy and rainy tomorrow,

704
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,370
I'll chop off your head.

705
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,930
Why is it raining again?

706
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,330
Be careful.

707
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,410
Don't get wet.

708
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
I see.

709
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,370
As long as the Sunny Doll is taken off, and someone reads the chant,

710
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,370
and it will rain.

711
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,360
And if the Sunny Doll is hung up,

712
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,420
the rain will stop.

713
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,080
The rain has stopped now.

714
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,180
Shall we go out and take a look?

715
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,930
Sure.

716
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,440
With this Sunny Doll,

717
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,840
it won't rain for a while.

718
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Let's go.
