(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,970
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,030
There are mostly rich people

4
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,070
in this school.

5
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,550
Why do you say so?

6
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,210
In the old society,

7
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,910
only rich families

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,509
could afford to send girls to high school.

9
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,550
Seeing so many students in the canteen,

10
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,330
I suddenly feel that this door is not that scary.

11
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,910
Do you want anything else?

12
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,330
I'll eat whatever Lingling eats.

13
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,789
Why are you so nice to him?

14
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,310
Because I think

15
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,190
Lingling and my sister are a perfect match.

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,650
I want them to be together.

17
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,790
Don't look at me.

18
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,140
It hasn't even happened yet.

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
That's not true.

20
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,950
Hasn't happened yet?

21
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,310
It won't happen.

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,400
Why are you so bossy?

23
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,430
Let me tell you.

24
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,270
Baijie doesn't like bossy boys.

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,960
You need to compete fairly.

26
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,850
I'll get you some food.

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
I'll go with you.

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,710
Why did you upset him?

29
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,829
I was just encouraging him.

30
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,630
Otherwise,

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,390
how could he search for clues?

32
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,690
If he thinks he's got this,

33
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,270
he won't work hard.

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,070
I think that would be tasty.

35
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,330
Who do you think

36
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,510
the Door Ghost is in this door?

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,830
A student or a teacher?

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,590
It's specifically arranged within the context of such an era.

39
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,850
Does it mean anything?

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,770
Let's eat first.

41
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,110
Ask a student later

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,230
to see if anything special has happened

43
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,990
at school recently.

44
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,710
Brother-in-law.

45
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,110
Try this.

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,990
Lingling,

47
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,230
eat more.

48
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,110
Hey,

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,710
I want to ask you something.

50
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,750
Did anything strange happen

51
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,390
in school recently?

52
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,990
I don't know.

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,230
Hey,

54
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,750
we haven't finished yet.

55
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,080
You're leaving just like that?

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,710
It's so rude.

57
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,470
I-It's useless to ask me.

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,050
If you really want to know something,

59
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,590
go to the archive room

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,520
and read the newspapers from a few days ago.

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,250
All the news has been posted in these newspapers.

62
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,310
Are you afraid of something?

63
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,710
No, I'm not.

64
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,830
Let go of me, please.

65
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm going to be late.

66
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,710
Forget it. Let him go.

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Boy,

68
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll see you again.

69
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,390
A student from Class 3, Grade 3.

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,150
I don't know his name,

71
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,390
but it's easy to find him.

72
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,080
How do you know that?

73
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,190
He's wearing a badge.

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,810
It shows his class.

75
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,430
You didn't see this, did you?

76
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,470
I...

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,590
I-I just...

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,750
It's okay. I saw it.

79
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,630
Looks like you haven't worked hard enough.

80
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,630
Maybe

81
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,110
you got too little training in Obsidian.

82
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,110
You...

83
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,750
After lunch,

84
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,550
let's go to the archive room.

85
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,710
I saw a planar graph

86
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,990
at the gate of the school.

87
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,630
The location of the archive room should be marked on it.

88
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,190
Lingling is observant.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,070
(PLANAR GRAPH OF YING CAI HIGH SCHOOL)

90
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,470
This school is quite big.

91
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,250
Do you think we'll meet

92
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,570
people who work for Xiong Qi in this door?

93
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,760
It's very unlikely.

94
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,510
After all, you've just been enlisted.

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,110
They won't target us so soon.

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,720
Should we tell them?

97
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,590
No need.

98
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,430
Xiong Qi won't target the White Deer.

99
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,110
There are two teaching buildings.

100
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,390
The archive room is quite close to the old teaching building.

101
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,120
Shall we go there?

102
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,110
Let's not go to the archive room.

103
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,970
Go to the old teaching building to find clues first.

104
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,990
The student said

105
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,950
the clues were in the archive room.

106
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,990
Why bother?

107
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,430
My instinct guides me

108
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,270
to go to the old teaching building first.

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,310
Instinct.

110
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,470
What a joke.

111
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,790
Meng, where are we going?

112
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,850
I'll listen to you.

113
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,640
I'll listen to Zhu Meng.

114
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,210
Let's go to the old teaching building first.

115
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,030
Didn't they just quarrel?

116
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,909
How did they reconcile so soon?

117
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,130
There's no eternal enemy in the door.

118
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,390
Don't get emotional over a trivial matter.

119
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,990
You'll get yourself killed.

120
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,470
You are right.

121
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,510
It's not that I can't pick the lock.

122
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,570
I can pick the lock.

123
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,430
I need to think of a way.

124
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,870
I'll put a stick in it,

125
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,130
and I have to pick the lock in a short time.

126
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,870
Bro.

127
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,510
We are meant to meet again.

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,360
You're here to look for clues too?

129
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,910
The NPC said

130
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,470
that we would repair the old teaching building

131
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,750
at the gate.

132
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,030
That means there must be some clues.

133
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,550
Are you going too?

134
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,550
Yes.

135
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,790
We're here too.

136
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,710
This old teaching building doesn't look that shabby.

137
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,510
Maybe the school is rich,

138
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,590
and they just want to demolish it and reconstruct it.

139
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,030
This lock is so thick.

140
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,310
Can you pick it?

141
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,230
Watch this, bro.

142
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,240
Bro, I did this a lot outside.

143
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,550
No way, my stomach hurts again.

144
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,460
Are you not feeling well?

145
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,250
Then stay here and wait for us.

146
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,870
No, let's go in together.

147
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,870
Go. Hurry up.

148
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,390
Shall we follow them?

149
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,550
No.

150
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,110
We should keep our distance

151
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,930
from unfamiliar players.

152
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,310
Xia Rubei,

153
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,630
you weren't so timid

154
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,950
when you were with us in Obsidian.

155
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,280
You dare to go anywhere.

156
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,470
Why did you become a rookie here?

157
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
I know it.

158
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,590
You want to act weak in front of your Meng?

159
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,150
I think

160
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,550
Meng has a lot of experience.

161
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,630
I want to learn more from him.

162
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,230
Alright.

163
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,610
Go in and have a look.

164
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,679
OK, Lingling. I'll go with you.

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,559
By the way, learn more from Baijie when you go out.

166
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,789
She is experienced.

167
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,789
I...

168
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,510
This school building is not old.

169
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,840
Why do they renovate it?

170
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,550
It's our dorm that should be renovated.

171
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,000
It looks like it was built only one or two years ago.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,430
It does not look like an old school building.

173
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,070
The more unreasonable it is,

174
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,210
the more suspicious it is.

175
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,400
What's the sound upstairs?

176
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,950
Did something happen to them upstairs?

177
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,190
So annoying.

178
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,630
What are they doing? Are they crazy?

179
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,070
Wait.

180
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,560
They are down there.

181
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,800
If they are downstairs,

182
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,950
then who's upstairs?

183
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,710
Are you going back now?

184
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,190
No more clues?

185
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,830
We've searched everywhere. There's nothing.

186
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,760
What about the girl following you?

187
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,830
Where is she?

188
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,550
She went to the toilet.

189
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,950
We're waiting for her here.

190
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,150
Why does she have to go to the toilet now?

191
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,620
It looks like he never goes to the toilet.

192
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,750
It couldn't be this loud

193
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,350
for a girl to go to the toilet.

194
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,720
Let's take a look upstairs.

195
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,390
You knew it would be dangerous up there.

196
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,430
This is not rational.

197
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,230
Lingling, let me go with you.

198
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,000
You are the bravest.

199
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,350
Baijie likes brave men.

200
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,550
Save it.

201
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll go upstairs first.

202
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,660
(Toilet)

203
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
(Toilet)

204
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,990
Liu Zhuangxiang?

205
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,870
Are you there?

206
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,430
Liu Zhuangxiang, Zhong Chengjian, where are you?

207
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,790
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

208
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,390
That's hilarious.

209
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,510
She likes bananas very much,

210
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,500
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

211
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,390
What a poor thing!

212
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,870
Sako has gone far away.

213
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,300
She'll forget me, won't she?

214
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,830
So lonely, Sako.

215
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,470
Do you know what the last line of the song is?

216
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,510
Do you know what the last line of the song is?

217
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,710
(I've lost my legs. Would you give me yours?)

218
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,550
I've lost my legs.

219
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,550
Would you give me yours?

220
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,910
Thank you

221
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,190
for giving me your left leg.

222
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,870
Ah!

223
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,630
Let's go.

224
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,770
Why is there no one up here?

225
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,110
Check the front area.

226
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,550
It should be blood.

227
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,830
You really are an expert.

228
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,240
You have good eyesight.

229
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,390
Is it Qin's blood?

230
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,710
Qin might have died.

231
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,470
She must have violated the taboo conditions.

232
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,530
That's why the Door Ghost killed her.

233
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,830
That's right.

234
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,030
So,

235
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,270
what is the taboo?

236
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,270
Did you hear the song?

237
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,870
Who heard the crow singing?

238
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,790
Let's go to the archive room.

239
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,080
Who saw the snowflakes floating?

240
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,770
Who was thrown in the middle of the road?

241
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,830
Have you seen Qin?

242
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,610
She's missing.

243
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,710
Missing?

244
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,870
What do you mean?

245
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,040
How can a living person disappear?

246
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,270
Shut up.

247
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,190
You should have understood why she went missing inside the door.

248
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,790
Did anything strange happen

249
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,320
in this building?

250
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,270
No.

251
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,430
This building is an ordinary one.

252
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,630
There's nothing odd in each classroom.

253
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,670
That's why we thought

254
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,670
nothing would happen to Qin in the bathroom.

255
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,330
So, we came out to wait for her.

256
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,510
Let's go somewhere else.

257
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
What's wrong?

258
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,270
Luckily, I met you as soon as I came in the door.

259
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,210
You're much cuter than Zhong Chengjian.

260
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,070
Didn't you say you're great?

261
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,250
Why is someone gone in less than a day?

262
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,950
Zhong Chengjian,

263
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,950
this isn't your first time passing the door.

264
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,280
Don't act like a rookie.

265
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,200
I didn't ask you to follow me, did I?

266
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,190
If you don't want to,

267
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,190
then get lost.

268
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,510
Didn't I hire you to take me pass the door?

269
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,970
You don't know?

270
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,990
But you have to know!

271
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
Get lost!

272
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,310
What made such a loud noise

273
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,830
upstairs just now?

274
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,830
What do you think?

275
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,750
It sounds like

276
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,710
a single-legged person hopping on the floor.

277
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,470
You have passed many doors.

278
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,520
Why are you still so scared?

279
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,550
I've been afraid of ghosts since I was a kid.

280
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,350
That should be Sako

281
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,290
in the clue, hopping up there.

282
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,150
Sako?

283
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,470
Could it be

284
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,710
the legendary Sako?

285
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,790
Don't be afraid.

286
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,470
She won't kill you.

287
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,480
She only wants your leg.

288
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,950
Look at you.

289
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,590
Forget it.

290
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,430
Let's not go to the old teaching building.

291
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,720
Let's check the old newspapers in the archive room

292
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,950
and see what happened in this school.

293
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,520
Aren't you curious?

294
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,850
Curiosity killed the cat.

295
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,740
Haven't you seen those who died fast in horror movies

296
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,340
were all very curious.

297
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,270
Okay, I'll listen to you.

298
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,520
Let's go to the archive room first.

299
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,670
Then why didn't we go straight to the archive room

300
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,870
but go around here?

301
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,190
Because we want to show you

302
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,470
our cute Sachiko.

303
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
You...

304
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,590
You are not gentle at all.

305
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,410
Why are you always bickering with a little girl?

306
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
A little girl?

307
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,390
Why are you always against her?

308
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,630
Can't you see that she likes you?

309
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,630
She does?

310
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,910
Cut the crap.

311
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,770
I don't want my sister's future boyfriend

312
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,230
to be two-timing.

313
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,550
You agreed with me seeing Baijie?

314
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,550
Impossible.

315
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,869
You have no chance.

316
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,030
Don't worry.

317
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,270
She's just a kid.

318
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,870
I don't like her at all.

319
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,110
I only have Baijie in my heart.

320
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,190
Who knows?

321
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,830
I'd better test Lingling first.

322
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,310
Let's go.

323
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,040
(Archive Room)

324
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,830
It's a big archive room.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,860
Why didn't they call it a library?

326
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,990
Those students didn't have time to read back then.

327
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,190
Students back then also

328
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,880
had pressure from the college entrance exam?

329
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,630
Excuse me, sir.

330
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,130
What made you here?

331
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,360
We're here to check some information.

332
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,590
Register first.

333
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,790
(Meng Yu)

334
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,090
Where are the old newspapers?

335
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,010
Let's get started.

336
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,790
The tragedy of Ying Cai High School?

337
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,040
Come and take a look.

338
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,150
A major Tragedy happened at Ying Cai High School yesterday.

339
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,710
Three students in Class 2, Grade 11 died miserably in the classroom.

340
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,550
Their left legs were all chopped off.

341
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,310
Their limbs haven't been found yet.

342
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,750
Was it a murder or a robbery?

343
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,470
The police stated that they must solve the case

344
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,930
and arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

345
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,200
Class 2, Grade 11

346
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,310
is the floor where Qin disappeared.

347
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,830
The school is full of disasters.

348
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,740
Accidents happened frequently.

349
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
And all were

350
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,310
in the old teaching building.

351
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,870
No wonder the school wants to repair the old buildings.

352
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,310
I guess the Feng Shui is bad.

353
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,240
Did it record the time it happened?

354
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,870
No.

355
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,790
I guess it happened in recent years.

356
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,270
And it's said

357
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,790
that there was a murder case every day.

358
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,290
The students who died were in the same class.

359
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,520
Can we find anything related to the car accident?

360
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,440
I don't think we can.

361
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,960
There are too many newspapers here.

362
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,830
How can we find it among all the files?

363
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,230
I'll ask the man outside.

364
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,510
Meng,

365
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,790
you told me

366
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,550
that Sako was in the news,

367
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,870
bled to death in a car accident,

368
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,270
and lost one leg.

369
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,460
But why did she go to the teaching building to kill others?

370
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,400
Could it be because

371
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,270
all the students sang that rhyme?

372
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,400
It seems that the accidents in the news

373
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,720
are all related to Sachiko.

374
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,470
Are we still going to the old teaching building?

375
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,600
It's too dangerous.

376
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,950
According to the previous rules,

377
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,350
in such a critical place,

378
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,190
we can either get a key or a door.

379
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,310
We must go there.

380
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,390
If you're afraid,

381
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,070
wait for us in the dorm.

382
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,500
No.

383
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,790
I'm fine.

384
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,720
I will work hard to adapt to this game

385
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,010
and try to be your helpful assistant.

386
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,950
You've passed many doors.

387
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,040
You shouldn't be like a novice.

388
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,390
But I still get nervous.

389
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Two years ago,

390
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,070
there was a car accident.

391
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,110
A freshman died.

392
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,240
The time of death was early spring.

393
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,590
What's her name?

394
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,410
The man outside said he was too old to memorize it.

395
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,870
He only knew it was a girl.

396
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,050
Which class was she in?

397
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,950
Class 2, too.

398
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,830
Since the dead were all from Class 2,

399
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,770
it must have something to do with this class.

400
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,000
It would be better if we could get the name list of this class.

401
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,640
There must be

402
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,390
the name list here.

403
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,670
The problem is how to find it.

404
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,880
We can't go through them one by one.

405
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,850
I don't have the patience.

406
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,630
My patience was all spent on Baijie.

407
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,710
That's all for today.

408
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,770
It's getting late.

409
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,350
We can't take any action at night.

410
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,350
Let's go back.

411
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,510
One person died

412
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,310
on the very first day.

413
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,820
Do you think

414
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,040
someone will die tomorrow?

415
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,950
I think so.

416
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,950
I agree.

417
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:48,910
Lingling,

418
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,060
what do you think?

419
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,750
I told you not to think about Baijie

420
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,390
and to care more about us, OK?

421
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,670
I didn't.

422
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,920
What did we say then?

423
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,790
Forget it.

424
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,150
Bro.

425
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,950
We agreed to compete fairly.

426
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,430
Don't play tricks behind my back.

427
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,230
Alright, stop talking about this.

428
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,070
We have to get up early tomorrow, right?

429
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,070
I'm going to bed.

430
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,810
What are you doing?

431
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,390
Don't tear it.

432
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,870
What do you want?

433
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,330
Tearing it off, of course.

434
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,110
You can't tear it off.

435
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,910
If you hadn't kept the rubbish,

436
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,310
Qin wouldn't die.

437
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,610
Let me say it again.

438
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,230
You can't tear it off!

439
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,630
I won't listen to you!

440
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,950
Okay.

441
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,990
You want to tear them off?

442
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,070
There are many in the dorms outside.

443
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,470
Move out and tear them up.

444
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,070
Fine.

445
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,070
So weird.

446
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,150
He's crazy.

447
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,270
I'm so mad!

448
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,950
You all want to die, but I don't.

449
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,720
One.

450
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,670
Two.

451
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,440
Why are you still keeping them?

452
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,540
I asked you to take me pass the doors.

453
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,190
But I was forbidden to do lots of things.

454
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,390
Then why should I keep you?

455
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,550
Then why should I keep you?

456
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,790
Even if you all die here,

457
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,520
I don't want to die here either.

458
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,470
Time for bed.

459
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,070
It's summer. Why is it still so cold?

460
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,430
Who?

461
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,750
Who is it?

462
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,920
Why did you leave me behind?

463
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,830
I'm so scared.

464
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,750
Qin?

465
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,950
I can't see you when I come out.

466
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,630
Where have you been?

467
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,070
Qin, are you okay?

468
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,110
It's all Liu Zhuangxiang's fault.

469
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,470
He didn't let me wait for you.

470
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,060
Where have you been?

471
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,750
The school is too big.

472
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,640
I got lost.

473
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,350
Got lost?

474
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,710
Let me turn on the light.

475
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,040
Don't turn on the light.

476
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,470
My clothes are dirty.

477
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,910
I just took them off.

478
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,670
In this way,

479
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,990
I want to turn on the lights more.

480
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,030
How did you get in?

481
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,510
Your door is not locked.

482
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,990
So I came in.

483
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,230
Your steps are so light.

484
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,110
I didn't hear anything.

485
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,190
All right, since you're fine

486
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,930
and it's getting late. Let's go to bed early.

487
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,950
It's so cold.

488
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,830
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

489
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,350
That's hilarious.

490
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,990
She likes bananas very much,

491
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,910
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

492
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,390
What a poor thing!

493
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,710
What is this mess?

494
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,950
Bloody and blurred, but I'm still singing

495
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,110
Qin,

496
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,110
aren't you cold?

497
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,750
Qin?

498
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,690
What's the last line in the lyric?

499
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,270
What is the last line of the song?

500
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,470
What's the last line of the lyrics?

501
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,750
I've lost my legs.

502
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,270
Would you give me yours?

503
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,820
Your soul is now empty

504
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,730
I've lost my legs.

505
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,340
Would you give me yours?

506
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,790
I've lost my legs.

507
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,670
Would you give me yours?

508
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,470
My soul will be empty from now on

509
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,230
You...

510
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,950
How do you know it's a lyric?

511
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,670
You're not Qin.

512
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,710
Who are you?

513
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,750
I've lost my legs.

514
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,550
Would you give me yours?

515
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,750
I've lost my legs.

516
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,430
Would you give me yours?

517
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,200
I've lost my legs.

518
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,560
Would you give me yours?

519
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,830
I've lost my legs.

520
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,230
Would you give me yours?

521
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,270
Why is the door...

522
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,230
I've lost my legs.

523
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,230
Help me.

524
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,070
Liu Zhuangxiang.

525
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Help!

526
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,230
I've lost my legs.

527
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,470
Would you give me yours?

528
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,320
Would you give me yours?

529
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,740
My soul is now empty

530
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,400
I've lost my legs

531
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,080
Would you give me yours?

532
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,620
My soul is now empty

533
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,330
I've lost my legs

534
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,980
Would you give me yours?

535
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,430
My soul is now empty

536
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,080
I've lost my legs

537
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,740
Would you give me yours?

538
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,140
Your soul will be empty from now on

539
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,760
(Improve Yourself) (Strengthen Your Body)

540
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,670
Good morning.

541
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,590
Good morning.

542
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,590
Don't be so polite.

543
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,190
Eat something and let's go to the archive room.

544
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,310
Let's go.

545
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,950
So cruel.

546
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,020
Can you take me out of here?

547
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,310
I told him not to tear these awards,

548
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,310
but he insisted.

549
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,270
Now he's dead.

550
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,590
I want to go home.

551
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,300
Don't you live with him?

552
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,250
Why did he appear here?

553
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,410
After he came back yesterday,

554
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,590
he insisted on tearing off those awards.

555
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,750
I couldn't stop him.

556
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,150
Then he moved out.

557
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,370
(I've lost my legs. Would you give me yours?)

558
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,640
My name is Nie Cheng.

559
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,750
Is this a clue note?

560
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:24,990
(I've lost my legs. Would you give me yours?)

561
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,990
I don't know.

562
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,310
What is written on this?

563
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,110
Banana.

564
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,310
Lonely.

565
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,430
What are these all about?

566
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,630
Do you know anything?

567
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Give it to me.

568
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,670
Why was he killed by Sako?

569
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,430
Maybe he tore the awards,

570
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,470
sang the song,

571
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,700
or both.

572
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,030
What about the body?

573
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,990
Is it okay to leave it here?

574
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,550
Don't worry.

575
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,250
The body will disappear soon.

576
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Why?

577
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,950
Because this is the rule inside the door.

578
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,030
All corpses will disappear in different ways.

579
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,910
After all, this is a game.

580
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,470
How could the game

581
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,910
ask us to handle the body ourselves?

582
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,440
Cheng, let's go.

583
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,140
Isn't she experienced?

584
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,070
She has passed several doors.

585
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,200
How did she pass the first three doors?

586
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,290
Why is she so timid?

587
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,890
Meng Yu helped her?

588
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,150
Does Yu Meng allow this?

589
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,040
How did she join White Deer?

590
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,250
Why do you have so many questions?

591
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,040
When Meng Yu sent her

592
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,830
to work as an undercover in Obsidian a while ago,

593
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,030
I investigated her.

594
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,910
Her family is poor.

595
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,190
She had a hard childhood.

596
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,080
That's why she is willing to endure hardship.

597
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,410
Although she's so sensitive,

598
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,670
it is undeniable

599
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,360
that she works hard.

600
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,230
No wonder.

601
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,100
She seems rational sometimes

602
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,120
and sometimes she's like a newbie.

603
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,630
Anyway,

604
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,190
she's a girl.

605
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,720
Don't always bully her.

606
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,340
When did I bully her?

607
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,910
I was training her.

608
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,510
She should be grateful to me.

609
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,560
What are you talking about?

610
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,750
I'm telling Lingling

611
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,750
what Baijie likes.

612
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,990
Brother-in-law, tell me something.

613
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,670
It depends on your performance.

614
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,870
Okay, today

615
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll do whatever you say.

616
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,550
Today?

617
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,550
And in the future.

618
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,950
Okay, let's go to the archive room first

619
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,750
to search for information about Class 2.

620
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,750
Let's go.

621
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,510
What's wrong?

622
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,070
I'm fine.

623
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,380
It's just that my stomach is still a bit uncomfortable.

624
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,870
Wait for us at the door then.

625
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,070
Don't wander around.

626
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
We'll come out later.

627
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,630
I'm really fine.

628
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,510
I can go in, Meng.

629
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,949
Don't you listen to me?

630
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,550
Okay.

631
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,310
I didn't expect

632
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,070
the leader of White Deer to be so kind to women.

633
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,550
I just want to help others.

634
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm not pitying her.

635
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,870
I swear that I only love Baijie.

636
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,790
Stop swearing and search for information.

637
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,110
Who would believe

638
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,389
your casual oath?

639
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,830
I prefer the honest Lingling

640
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,389
to be my brother-in-law.

641
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,960
Why don't you believe me?

642
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,550
Ling, you are my nemesis.

It's 25 years in total.

647
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,630
Two years ago,

648
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,020
it was the 23rd students.

230.

655
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,630
Found it.

656
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,310
(The 23rd Students Status Files of Ying Cai High School. There are 34 people in Class 2, Grade 1)

657
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,950
The file states that there were 34 people in their class.

658
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,750
But the number of people in the photo is incorrect.

659
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,110
You are right.

660
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,230
There are 33 people in the photo.

661
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,030
33?

662
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,730
Did you count it wrong?

663
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,550
Impossible.

664
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,150
I'm a science student, okay?

665
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,690
Count it yourself.

(Group photo of Class 2, Grade 1)

667
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,070
There is indeed one missing.

668
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,710
Who could it be?

669
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,390
Could it be the student who died in a car accident?

(Student Information Form)

671
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,970
But if that's the case,

672
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,150
one person will be marked dead in the end.

673
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,030
Then maybe the person not in the photo

674
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,060
is Sako.

675
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,550
One page is torn off here.

676
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,230
It's torn off?

678
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,350
Even if a classmate has passed away,

679
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,110
it's impossible to tear up the file.

680
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,450
We have met him before.

681
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,070
Who is he?

682
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,230
Don't you remember?

683
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,090
The senior student we met in the canteen yesterday.

684
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,990
Let go of me, please.

685
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,190
I'm going to be late.

686
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,310
His name is Jiang Xinhong.

687
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,550
Didn't you say

688
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,960
that the name badge reads Class 3, Grade 3?

689
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,890
Of course, he is a student in Class 3, Grade 3.

690
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,920
It's hard to say whether Class 2, Grade 3 still exists or not.

691
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,590
Everyone in Class 2 died.

692
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,350
It's possible.

693
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,150
If the students in Class 2 were killed by Sako,

694
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,590
and he was the only one who survived,

695
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,800
then he must have done something special.

696
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,760
We need to find the student called Jiang Xinhong

697
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,890
and ask him about it.

I told her. She won't come in.

It's almost time.

702
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,270
Let's go.

703
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,050
What's that sound?

704
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,150
What's going on?

705
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,750
You guys are so clumsy.

706
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,230
You actually knocked over the cabinet.

707
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,270
Sorry, sir.

708
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,840
We'll help you clean up.

709
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,200
Who needs you to do that?

710
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,470
You don't understand how to organize these files at all.

711
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,550
The more you help, the messier it will be.

712
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,870
Fine. Just leave.

713
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,170
With so many files,

714
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,870
how can you distinguish between them?

715
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,630
I have it all in my mind.

716
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,630
There's no student in the school

717
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,030
that I don't know about.

718
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,440
So, there were many accidents that happened in the school recently.

719
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,960
Do you know that too?

720
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,230
Just leave.

721
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,650
Don't disturb my work.

722
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,400
How could you guys be so clumsy?
