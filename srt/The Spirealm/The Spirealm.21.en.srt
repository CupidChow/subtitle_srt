00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,360
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,080
(Episode 21)

3
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,470
Where is this place?

4
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,110
I want to go out.

5
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,790
You've been crying here for an hour.

6
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,380
Find a way out if you don't believe me.

7
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,110
Let's see if you can leave here.

8
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,550
Is this a TV show?

9
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,590
Can you let me out?

10
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,380
I really don't want to play.

11
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,310
I beg you.

12
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,310
Please let me go.

13
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,670
I told you this is not a TV show.

14
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,800
You're so annoying.

15
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,710
You made us so annoyed.

16
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,370
Do you know?

17
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,470
Mr. Yang.

18
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,270
She's just scared.

19
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,350
Su.

20
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,070
Everyone is scared.

21
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,590
Can you

22
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,150
please stop just thinking about yourself?

23
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,280
Think about others.

24
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,080
Don't make things worse, okay?

25
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,430
You entered just now?

26
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,920
Got held up. Ruan.

27
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,670
Xiong, you're here.

28
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,390
Impressive.

29
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,270
You're qualified for such a high-level door in a short time.

30
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,400
You've worked hard.

31
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,030
What a coincidence.

32
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,470
We haven't seen each other

33
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,580
since we came back from Snow Village.

34
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,380
I didn't expect to meet you here.

35
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,470
Yes.

36
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,150
What's happened to Xiong?

37
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,150
Is he in a bad mood?

38
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,470
Nothing.

39
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,470
Something happened to his team recently.

40
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,470
He's upset.

41
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,790
Ruan Baijie is waiting for me.

42
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,030
Let's share the clues

43
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,260
later.

44
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,440
It's okay. Go ahead.

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Okay.

46
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,310
Xiong Qi looks weird.

47
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,270
You're not him.

48
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,090
You don't know him either.

49
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,150
How do you know

50
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,040
which is the real him?

51
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,970
What are you doing?

52
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,790
Look at our situation.

53
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,790
Do you want to turn against him when we just entered?

54
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,830
Why don't you learn from your age?

55
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,630
I need an explanation.

56
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,550
Right?

57
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,350
Fine.

58
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,840
If you want me to die earlier, go ahead.

59
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,070
Be a hero. Go.

60
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,230
Hello, ten guests.

61
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,590
My master has been expecting you.

62
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Please come.

63
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
Everyone.

64
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,150
Please sit.

65
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,150
Everyone.

66
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,790
Please enjoy.

67
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,030
Her lipstick color is so ugly.

68
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,750
Eat your food.

69
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,310
These players

70
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,790
must be rookies.

71
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
I guess they haven't adapted to the situation inside.

72
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Everyone.

73
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,470
Go and see what you've been looking forward to.

74
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,270
Seven days left.

75
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,660
Your most anticipated painting is about to be done.

76
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,750
Please contain your excitement

77
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,750
and enjoy the scenery in the castle.

78
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,789
After Master finishes her painting,

79
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,909
you can appreciate and comment on it.

80
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
Today,

81
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,150
we won't disturb her anymore.

82
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,150
Next,

83
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,670
I'll take you to the guest rooms.

84
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,470
You are all guests of the castle.

85
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,870
Everyone will have an independent guest room.

86
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,190
The rooms are in unified standards,

87
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,450
and they'll be randomly assigned to you.

88
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,520
You can plan your day

89
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,910
as you wish.

90
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,830
When the bell rings,

91
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,710
it's time for meals.

92
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,350
Don't miss it.

93
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,390
Let's go find our rooms.

94
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,870
Let's go.

95
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,870
Who is it?

96
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,630
It's me.

97
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,670
You're still up?

98
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm waiting for you.

99
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,790
What's wrong?

100
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,290
I think something is wrong with Xiong Qi.

101
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,790
He didn't ask us anything

102
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,390
after Mengmeng's accident.

103
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,670
Aren't they friends?

104
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,720
That's easy to explain.

105
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,690
Someone framed us.

106
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,030
He bought it.

107
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,770
I'll explain it to him.

108
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,910
Forget it.

109
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,270
Do you have evidence?

110
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,270
Even if you have evidence, will he believe you?

111
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,670
Mengmeng is really dead.

112
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,230
I won't go then.

113
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,750
The door is getting more and more troublesome.

114
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,030
The doors will get

115
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,770
more and more troublesome in the future.

116
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,310
But I believe you.

117
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,530
It's troublesome.

118
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,030
But it's a game,

119
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,800
I can definitely finish it.

120
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,070
What's wrong?

121
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,310
I have this painting in my room too.

122
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,740
It's also a castle painting.

123
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,790
I don't feel comfortable watching these two.

124
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,030
Then take it off.

125
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I did.

126
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,310
How about Cheng?

127
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,150
She's in a room in the corner.

128
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,510
I'll visit her later.

129
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,750
Okay.

130
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,070
So the butler means

131
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,910
he wants us

132
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,770
to live in separate rooms.

133
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,270
Yes.

134
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,430
But we'll figure it out later.

135
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,490
Let's find a chance to live together.

136
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,870
Okay.

137
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,430
Rest early.

138
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
Who is it?

139
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,070
Sorry to bother you.

140
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,680
What can I do for you?

141
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,910
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,030
Here's the thing.

143
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,150
Can I change rooms with you?

144
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,910
Right?

145
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,510
My name is Su.

146
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,510
My friend Yang Jie lives next door.

147
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,510
So I want to change rooms with you.

148
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,910
I've checked my room.

149
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,910
Nothing is wrong.

150
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,000
Can we change rooms?

151
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,020
This is my first time here.

152
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,310
I'm really scared.

153
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,070
Please.

154
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,350
Okay.

155
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,790
Thank you.

156
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,190
Thank you.

157
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,280
You're welcome.

158
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,610
The room is over there.

159
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay.

160
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,870
Thank you.

161
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,760
This painting looks comfortable.

162
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,630
It's so hard.

163
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,510
I shouldn't have changed it.

164
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,070
Good morning.

165
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,350
Good morning.

166
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,890
Did you crash here last night?

167
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,950
In a gloomy castle,

168
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,060
I've got an empty room.

169
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,310
Do you think I'm a careless daredevil

170
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,170
who would stay alone in that room?

171
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,190
There you are.

172
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,840
Do all the big stars wake up with anger in the morning?

173
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,350
Maybe she didn't sleep well last night in my room.

174
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,350
What happened?

175
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,310
Nothing.

176
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,750
Everything was fine.

177
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,390
She followed the same old rule?

178
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,270
What else could she do?

179
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,950
I don't like

180
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,810
sharing my bed with someone else.

181
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,880
Then next time I'll have to sleep on the floor.

182
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,710
You're an exception.

183
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,370
You're such a good friend.

184
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,090
How was your sleep?

185
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,000
Good. The bed is soft.

186
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,710
Ruan Lanzhu is inhumane!

187
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,830
I can't believe he'd let me sleep on the floor!

188
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,430
Every muscle of mine is sore.

189
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,710
How about I let you sleep in bed next time?

190
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,870
Really?

191
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,080
I can share a bed with Lingling.

192
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,170
What's up? Did you not sleep well last night?

193
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,120
I swapped my room with someone.

194
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Swapped?

195
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,330
Who asked you to do that?

196
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,750
A new female player named Su.

197
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,910
She said she wanted a room next to her friend's.

198
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,570
How many times have I told you?

199
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,150
Your life's constantly at stake in the door challenges.

200
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,630
How could you take such an unnecessary risk?

201
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,390
What if it's a scheme they cooked up?

202
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,350
She's just a girl. It's all okay.

203
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,670
A girl?

204
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,910
What if she's a villain in disguise?

205
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,230
Forget it.

206
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,000
You won't understand what I'm saying anyway.

207
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,350
Alright. I got it.

208
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,510
It's said that newcomers are prone to be bullied by veterans.

209
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,470
But why does it seem to me

210
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,670
that you, a veteran of this game,

211
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,070
are always the one being fooled by newbies?

212
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,030
You just said

213
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,190
that newcomers would tend to be bullied by veterans.

214
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,850
Have you been bullied before?

215
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,150
I wasn't a superstar when I first started my career.

216
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,750
I've had all the experiences that a rookie would have,

217
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,750
or even more.

218
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,630
If you want to wear a crown, you need to bear its weight.

219
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,530
What a horrible time I had!

220
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,730
But what could I do?

221
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,910
I chose my path,

222
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,710
and I had to stick to it even with tears in my eyes.

223
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,640
It turns out that you learned to be tough the hard way.

224
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,170
I don't buy all those corny pep talks.

225
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,870
I count on myself,

226
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,110
and I feel strong.

227
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,540
Yeah. You're the strongest of all,

228
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,070
so it's suitable for you to sleep on the floor.

229
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,530
How cheeky you are to say that!

230
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,750
Is it

231
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,450
a drawing of this room?

232
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,230
Is there a clue here?

233
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,990
Ah!

234
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Something has happened!

235
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
It sounds like the voice

236
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,110
of the girl who switched rooms with me.

237
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,310
Let's go check it out.

238
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,510
What's wrong?

239
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,760
Su seems to have been staying in this room.

240
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,990
Wasn't this room originally assigned to you?

241
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,710
It's hard to predict what the future holds for us.

242
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,110
What are you looking for?

243
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,330
I've put a painting

244
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,200
that used to hang here into the closet.

245
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,990
Now it's gone.

246
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,750
There must be something unusual about that painting.

247
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,790
Xiong, about what happened to Mengmeng in the last door challenge,

248
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,270
we...

249
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,950
How dare you talk about Mengmeng with me?

250
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,950
Huh?

251
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,590
I'm telling you, I was so wrong about you.

252
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,990
You know what I'm saying?

253
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,340
Mengmeng's death was caused by Jiang Yingrui.

254
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,940
You don't have to believe me,

255
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,760
but I won't tolerate you

256
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,590
hurting my people.

257
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:10,850
I...

258
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,270
Alright. Stop it.

259
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,630
The food's ready.

260
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,240
Why don't we go eat first?

261
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,310
Let's see if there is

262
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,870
something fishy about the hostess.

263
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,870
Let's go.

264
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm sorry.

265
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,590
Alright. Let's go eat. Come on.

266
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,240
Is she leaving already?

267
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,230
The Madam is probably going to the rooftop studio.

268
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,690
There are a few places you'd better not go to.

269
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,070
First, it's the rooftop studio.

270
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,590
Second,

271
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,270
it's the room that stores unfinished paintings on the sixth floor.

272
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,600
As for the other places,

273
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,450
you may feel free to visit.

274
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,730
That said, please note

275
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,190
that Madam hates it when people touch her paintings.

276
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,710
Why aren't you eating?

277
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,040
You don't like the food?

278
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,230
I'm not in the mood to eat.

279
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,670
You should eat something.

280
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,270
What if this is the last meal?

281
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,680
Can't you say something positive?

282
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,680
What's the use of saying positive things?

283
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,930
As if you're the only clear-headed person here!

284
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,030
I'd like to go out and look around.

285
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,270
Does anyone want to come with me?

286
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,270
Me.

287
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
Me too.

288
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,390
Sir,

289
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,590
can I team up with you?

290
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,870
I'm so scared.

291
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
No.

292
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,950
I'm really scared.

293
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,830
I assure you

294
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
that I'll do my very best.

295
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,710
I-I won't be a burden to you.

296
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,550
Sorry.

297
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,630
I already asked to work with him yesterday.

298
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,230
Maybe you should turn to someone else for help.

299
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,630
History has repeated itself again.

300
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,630
What do you mean?

301
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,070
Previously, someone asked

302
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,430
to team up with us,

303
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,790
but we refused.

304
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,430
Later on, we found that he was playing dumb

305
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,830
in order to steal our key.

306
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,870
A large number of people

307
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,590
have initiated collaboration with me,

308
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,390
and none of them are new players.

309
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,670
Then, what drove her

310
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,400
to make that proposal?

311
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,070
We aren't allowed to touch these paintings, are we?

312
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,590
Didn't you notice how that man phrased it?

313
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,590
"Madam hates it."

314
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,240
Yes. She just hates it,

315
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,340
but she doesn't forbid it.

316
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,310
Anything wrong?

317
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,670
Nothing.

318
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,190
Some paintings just look pretentious.

319
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,710
I really don't know what they're expressing.

320
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,840
What about you guys?

321
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,470
It seems that the three of us

322
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,630
can't get anything from the paintings.

323
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,160
Let's take a look upstairs.

324
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,480
Are all of these paintings new?

325
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,030
I guess so.

326
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,710
It seems like the paint is still wet.

327
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,960
This painting looks so odd.

328
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,230
What do you think it's about?

329
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,230
It's very hard to tell

330
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,510
what is being described

331
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,550
in this painting.

332
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,340
It appears to me

333
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that a woman is climbing the stairs,

334
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,080
and being chased by something.

335
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,510
The image of her back is hinting

336
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,510
an unspeakable horror.

337
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,430
It's Su.

338
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,880
I recognize her clothes.

339
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,070
Then she must have died in agony.

340
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,440
There's still a possibility that Su was a scapegoat.

341
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,910
Their real target...

342
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,110
They meant to hurt me.

343
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,870
However,

344
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,790
they didn't know that I had switched rooms with Su.

345
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,910
So Su ended up taking the fall for me.

346
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,190
Or maybe they were targeting the Obsidian.

347
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,390
Good heavens!

348
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,550
Even you guys are in a rat race.

349
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,440
What am I supposed to do?

350
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,910
You're not their target.

351
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,630
But there might be collateral damage to me!

352
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,670
You're helping me get through this door challenge.

353
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,190
If anything happens to you,

354
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,390
I'm gonna suffer too.

355
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,390
Can I team up with you?

356
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,710
I'm so scared.

357
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,000
Could it be that person?

358
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,710
I'm not sure.

359
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,430
But we must act like

360
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,160
we haven't noticed them at all,

361
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,570
in case they become alert.

362
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Let's go.

363
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,990
Aren't they Xiong Qi and Ke?

364
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,830
What are they doing outside?

365
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,630
That umbrella is blocking my view.

366
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,310
I guess they're looking for clues.

367
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,350
Should we follow them?

368
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,670
I'm not going.

369
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,130
I hate it when it rains.

370
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,750
You need to calm down.

371
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,150
This is an unusual door challenge.

372
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,670
You must not lose your mind

373
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,430
because of what happened to Mengmeng.

374
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,430
Don't worry.

375
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,790
No matter what, I won't let you get in danger again.

376
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,750
The door challenges are getting more and more difficult.

377
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,110
If we are to survive,

378
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,510
I think we should work with Ling Jiushi.

379
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,870
Even if the issue about Mengmeng isn't factored in,

380
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,870
I still don't find Xia trustworthy.

381
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,760
I'll think about it.

382
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,910
Xiong!

383
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,270
Long time no see.

384
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,150
Oh!

385
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,110
What a shock that Ke is still alive!

386
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,110
Yang Meishu,

387
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,110
you knew we were taking this door challenge.

388
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,570
Why did you follow us here?

389
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,350
Didn't Yan Balang say

390
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,390
that the teams shouldn't

391
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,860
have malicious competition?

392
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
Xiong,

393
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,150
I've never been hostile to you.

394
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,910
Can't you feel it?

395
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,190
Cut it out!

396
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,390
On the contrary, we're rather hostile towards you.

397
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,390
Ke,

398
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,640
with all that you've been through,

399
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,860
how come you're still a hothead?

400
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,670
Xiong,

401
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,080
after we're done with all this,

402
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,320
don't forget to call me.

403
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,110
I'll show you

404
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,030
what a woman should be like.

405
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,670
I can also take that chance to dump my useless boyfriend.

406
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,230
What do you think you are saying?

407
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,230
Calm down.

408
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,270
Yang Meishu,

409
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,910
don't you mess with us,

410
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,270
or I promise you'll regret it.

411
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,270
Xiong,

412
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,910
I wouldn't dare to do so, would I?

413
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:02,670
I also have a reminder for you.

414
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,790
It's those from the Obsidian

415
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,870
who caused Mengmeng's death.

416
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,630
But I, no matter what,

417
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,210
am still a co-worker of yours.

418
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,240
Let's go. Go.

419
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,200
These paintings show an abstract style.

420
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,310
Madam learned from Huang Mingyuan.

421
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,830
This has always been the way she paints.

422
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,110
Huang Mingyuan? Who is that?

423
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,430
Don't you know him?

424
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,430
No.

425
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,120
He is a very famous painter.

426
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,680
When Madam was learning from Mr. Huang,

427
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,290
they had a close personal relationship.

428
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,470
But now they've drifted apart a bit.

429
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,750
Why would that happen?

430
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,670
I don't know the exact reason.

431
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,430
I remember years ago the Madam said

432
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,990
Mr. Huang used to be prouder of her than any other of his students,

433
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,150
and that she believed Mr. Huang would help her launch a great career.

434
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,150
But later,

435
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,190
maybe out of jealousy,

436
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,949
someone started rumors about her.

437
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,150
Rumors?

438
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,590
The rumors said that Madam plagiarized Mr. Huang's paintings.

439
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,230
Given how much admiration she had for Mr. Huang,

440
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,290
how was it possible for her to do that?

441
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,690
I didn't know there would be such a story.

442
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,710
There are tons of stories like that.

443
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,370
What's to be surprised about?

444
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,469
Some people

445
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,790
aren't competent,

446
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,250
but they long for fame,

447
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,110
so they make a fuss about nothing and pick a fight with others,

448
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,840
in order to attract attention.

449
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,429
Don't get too emotional about it.

450
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,489
This is just a clue provided by an NPC.

451
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,710
Okay.

452
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,270
Come on. Let's go back to our rooms.

453
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,350
Who is it?

454
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,430
Is it Jiushi?

455
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,390
What's up? Is there bad news?

456
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,000
There's something wrong with my room.

457
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Come on in.

458
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,970
Why is the doorknob on the opposite side?

459
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,910
Good morning.

460
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,350
What's your name again?

461
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,430
I've forgotten it.

462
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,030
My name is Tan Zaozao.

463
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,590
Oh, it's Zaozao. I recall it now.

464
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,910
Well,

465
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,090
excuse me for a second. I'll be right back.

466
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,910
Ling Jiushi, I'm Tan Zaozao!

467
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,070
Ling Jiushi, I am Tan Zaozao.

468
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,790
Ling Jiushi, come out!

469
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,550
Come out!

470
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,470
Ling Jiushi, come out!

471
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,830
Come out!

472
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,110
Lingling,

473
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,890
what's wrong with you?

474
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,030
Open the door.

475
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,030
If you don't open the door,

476
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,350
I'll break in.

477
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,470
What's your name?

478
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,790
Are you okay?

479
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,560
Did your brain get damaged from sleeping?

480
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,670
What's my name?

481
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,830
Yu... Yu Lingling.

482
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,990
You look terrible.

483
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,490
What happened?

484
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,790
It's nothing. Where is he?

485
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,390
He's still getting ready.

486
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,520
He will be here soon.

487
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,670
I almost died

488
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,270
last night.
