00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,330
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,950
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,970
Tomorrow morning, we'll assemble at 8 o'clock sharp.

4
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,090
Don't be late.

5
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,690
Where are we going tomorrow?

6
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,050
Tomorrow we're heading to a special place.

7
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,770
It's iconic and unique.

8
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
I'm afraid I have to keep you in suspense for now.

9
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,770
Anyway, I assure you that tomorrow's trip

10
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,050
will leave a deep impression on you.

11
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,889
By the way,

12
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,490
this mountainous area is windy at night.

13
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,500
You'd better not go out.

14
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,450
Try to hit the sack early.

15
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,490
Mu Yu, slow down, or you're gonna choke.

16
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,090
Zhu Meng, you've nearly slept for a day.

17
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,620
Why are you still fatigued?

18
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,290
Sorry.

19
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,710
I've always been in bad health.

20
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,060
I'm sorry if I've inconvenienced you.

21
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Lingling,

22
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,860
thank you for taking care of me.

23
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
What?

24
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,770
I'm fine.

25
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,490
The noodles are a bit salty. I'll go get some water.

26
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,470
Be nice when you talk to them. Don't quarrel.

27
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,090
What is this smell?

28
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,450
Someone just died. How could you eat?

29
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,890
Lingling.

30
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,770
will we die here?

31
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,130
I'm so scared.

32
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,220
Don't overthink it.

33
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,490
Just go to sleep.

34
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,570
We'll be fine.

35
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,290
Lingling.

36
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm cold.

37
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,500
Shall I get you a blanket?

38
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,180
I'd hate to trouble you.

39
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,340
Can I just crash with you?

40
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,210
You're too fat.

41
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,490
My bed's too small to fit two people.

42
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,530
That came out wrong.

43
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm the fat one. I'm too fat.

44
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,650
Do you still want a blanket?

45
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,650
No.

46
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,990
I've got lots of fat.

47
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,430
I guess I can hang in there and get over it.

48
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,610
Okay.

49
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,830
You're awake now, aren't you?

50
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,810
I'll go see if breakfast is ready.

51
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Last night,

52
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,370
did anything happen?

53
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,450
No.

54
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,130
It was very quiet,

55
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,770
without any strange sounds.

56
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,080
I meant between you and Xu Jin.

57
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,410
What could possibly happen between me and her?

58
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,610
What broke you up

59
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,610
with your last girlfriend?

60
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,340
Girlfriend?

61
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,370
I've never had a girlfriend.

62
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,770
How am I supposed to have an ex-girlfriend?

63
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,780
Usually, I'd study my projects and work extra hours,

64
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,290
thinking about how virtual reality interacts with real life,

65
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,300
or I'd play games.

66
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,980
How would I find time to date girls?

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,250
Oh.

68
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,400
What's that question for?

69
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,010
Well...

70
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,010
I was just asking.

71
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,570
This used to be the village's watchtower.

72
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,170
It enabled the villagers to see what's far away,

73
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,250
or if there were bandits.

74
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,970
Some people said

75
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,750
it could even give a peek into the future.

76
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,300
You can go around for the next six hours.

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,090
I'll pick you up then.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Please enjoy it.

79
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,050
Attention.

80
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,930
Don't make loud noises.

81
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,130
So no loud noise

82
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,450
is also one of the taboo conditions?

83
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
So many taboos.

84
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,820
If we weren't in the door,

85
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,080
she would've been killed several times.

86
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,420
Why don't you go now

87
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,730
to see if she will pop out the key.

88
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,409
You seem much better.

89
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,490
I'll hang in even if I'm not well,

90
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,010
unlike someone

91
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,290
who likes to act.

92
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,190
Zhu Meng feels better now.

93
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,770
Zhu,

94
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,170
please.

95
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,210
How much did Liu Ping pay you?

96
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,930
I didn't expect

97
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,670
to meet the boss of the Obsidian here.

98
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,220
She's also lucky enough

99
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,970
to have you here,

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
Li Dongyuan from the White Deer.

101
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,770
How did you know it was me?

102
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,650
Liu Ping is generous.

103
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,900
She will certainly invite a top-class one.

104
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,560
Since she failed to invite me,

105
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,020
it must be the White Deer.

106
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,210
And the boss of the White Deer

107
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,430
is famous for being greedy for money.

108
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,850
Sometimes dealing with smart ones

109
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,430
is also a kind of enjoyment.

110
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
At least,

111
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,460
you don't have to do something worthless.

112
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,610
I heard the drum.

113
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,280
Where did it come from?

114
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,010
From afar.

115
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,430
Not long after the drum last time,

116
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,030
a rain of needles started.

117
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,690
Your buddy is pretty good.

118
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
He has sharp ears.

119
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,670
Can you hear the sound?

120
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,050
I can't.

121
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,970
Then why did you say that?

122
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,970
I trust him.

123
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,260
We're going in to take shelter.

124
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,090
Mr. Li, do you want to join us?

125
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,090
I'd love to.

126
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,410
Also,

127
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,690
my name is Meng Yu.

128
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,810
Let's go upstairs.

129
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,580
That's what I wanted.

130
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,570
What's wrong?

131
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
Lingling,

132
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,540
can I wait for you here?

133
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,930
Okay.

134
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,450
Meng Yu, I'll wait here too.

135
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Let's go.

136
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
There's a drum.

137
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,990
What a beautiful drum!

138
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,950
Don't touch. Something is wrong.

139
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,210
Xu Jin.

140
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,060
Where is she?

141
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,810
Where is she?

142
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,450
Where is she?

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,810
Where is she?

144
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,490
Where is she?

145
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,050
Where is she?

146
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,050
Where is she?

147
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,410
Where is she?

148
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,410
Where is she?

149
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,620
Where is she?

150
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,210
Where is she?

151
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,780
Help me!

152
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,570
Don't leave me.

153
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,330
Can this shitty thing you wrote work?

154
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,330
What are these?

155
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,210
What kind of trash are these?

156
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,410
Are you stupid?

157
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,850
No one would play

158
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,050
the games you wrote.

159
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,930
How can you be so stupid?

160
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,420
Come down.

161
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,370
Come down and you'll be free.

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,610
Come down.

163
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,090
There's nothing to worry about.

164
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,180
Come down.

165
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,650
Come down and you'll be free.

166
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,820
Come down.

167
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,290
There's nothing to worry about.

168
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,290
Come down.

169
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,370
Lingling.

170
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,580
Come down.

171
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Lingling.

172
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,410
Lingling.

173
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Lingling.

174
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,170
Yu Lingling.

175
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,530
Jiushi, Jiushi.

176
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,090
Come back, Jiushi.

177
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,090
Lingling.

178
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,930
Lingling, come back.

179
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,050
Jiushi. Come back. Jiushi.

180
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,570
Lingling. Yu Lingling.

181
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Lingling.

182
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,410
Yu Lingling.

183
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,370
Are you okay?

184
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,690
You're right.

185
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,290
There is something wrong with the drum.

186
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
Why is it dark?

187
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,900
It's still daytime.

188
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,780
But the spacetime here is chaotic.

189
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
So it's dark.

190
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
What happened

191
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
just now?

192
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,570
I had hallucinations.

193
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,230
And it's daytime in it.

194
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,170
How did you get out of it?

195
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,010
This experience may help everyone.

196
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,410
I didn't do anything.

197
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,690
Just...

198
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,180
My friend woke me up.

199
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,730
Where is Xu Jin?

200
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,060
Didn't she knock the drum just now?

201
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,740
Xu Jin and Liu Ping were down there.

202
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,210
They didn't come with us.

203
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,930
What's wrong?

204
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,990
I heard something inside.

205
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
What is this?

206
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,730
It's a notebook.

207
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,250
She's gone?

208
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,050
She's gone.

209
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,370
She's gone.

210
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,370
I can't find her.

211
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,650
The story of the human skin drum is about

212
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,730
the sister looking for the older sister.

213
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,190
So this notebook belongs to the younger one.

214
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,020
One page in the middle was torn off.

215
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,290
Right.

216
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,790
You can't tell until you look closely.

217
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,910
What sound did you heard just now?

218
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,690
It's like someone was scratching the wall.

219
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,890
Scratching the wall?

220
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,490
If you still mess around with your hands,

221
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,330
I'll ask your brother to teach you a lesson.

222
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,930
I just wanted to show the voice.

223
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,930
Is this it?

224
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,970
Show us?

225
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,180
The last people who showed us like this

226
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,240
was lying in the grave for a long time.

227
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,540
You can have this notebook.

228
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,370
You just give it to us?

229
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,480
Li Dongyuan is rumored to be very petty.

230
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
But today,

231
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,300
why are you so generous?

232
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,570
My name is Meng Yu.

233
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,330
Also,

234
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,140
after breaking the door,

235
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,140
I have something to ask you.

236
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,210
Here.

237
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,850
There's really something.

238
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,690
Let me show you.

239
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,340
This girl is a member of the Obsidian.

240
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,210
I've heard about her for a long time.

241
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,390
It's rare to see such a smart pretty girl.

242
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,490
I hope

243
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,370
you can help me

244
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,500
introduce us to each other.

245
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,540
Are you sure you want to know her?

246
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,610
Of course.

247
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,250
I've admired her for a long time.

248
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,850
You can't appreciate a heroine's beauty.

249
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,090
You're not her type.

250
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,730
You have no right to make decisions for her.

251
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,180
You just need to introduce us to each other.

252
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,210
As for the rest,

253
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,140
I can do it by myself.

254
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,730
Let's talk later.

255
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,010
Stop laughing.

256
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,020
Ghost! Ghost!

257
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,340
There... there is a ghost.

258
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,130
What ghost?

259
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,940
How would I know?

260
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,330
How dare I look carefully?

261
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,130
Why are you making such a fuss?

262
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,190
Is this your first time into the door?

263
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,770
So what?

264
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,670
It's none of your business.

265
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,170
It's all your fault.

266
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,220
I paid for you.

267
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,750
Where have you been?

268
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,690
You left me here terrified.

269
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,090
By the way,

270
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,830
you were hanging out with them.

271
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,099
Do you still want the money?

272
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,530
If you dare leave me alone again

273
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,530
for so long,

274
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,810
I'm gonna...

275
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,810
So?

276
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,930
Leave me?

277
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,700
You'll just die sooner.

278
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,609
If there's nothing else,

279
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,810
let's get out of here.

280
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,690
Don't make it too public.

281
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,050
Why didn't Liu Ping follow?

282
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,690
Maybe

283
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
she went down.

284
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,010
She's gone.

285
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,130
Do you remember what the guide told us

286
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,650
when we got here?

287
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,780
Don't make loud noises.

288
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,700
She must have violated the taboo conditions.

289
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,050
What about you?

290
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,780
Did you see anything upstairs?

291
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,130
Just a drum.

292
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,570
I didn't dare to touch it.

293
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,770
Did you play the drum just now?

294
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,610
I dare not.

295
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,160
Liu Ping and I have been waiting downstairs.

296
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,210
What's wrong?

297
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,220
Blame yourself for the death of the client?

298
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,970
Breaking doors is risky.

299
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,650
I've told her many times

300
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,930
not to make it public.

301
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,890
I didn't expect that she wouldn't listen.

302
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,950
She didn't listen,

303
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,750
and the final payment is gone.

304
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,210
Just think of it as a trip for nothing.

305
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,210
Next time,

306
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I have to find someone obedient.

307
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,770
Baijie breaks doors often too, right?

308
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,850
Can you let me be with her next time?

309
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,110
She doesn't like a bad-tempered person.

310
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,770
What's wrong with my temper?

311
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,950
I have a pretty good temper.

312
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,330
I hope so.

313
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,700
My friends,

314
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,530
today's schedule is over.

315
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,250
Please gather downstairs.

316
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Are you okay?

317
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm fine.

318
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,950
I was too tired before.

319
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,970
I slept well inside the door.

320
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,220
I'll be fine after one more night.

321
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Let's go.

322
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,690
It's so scary today.

323
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm a little scared.

324
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,170
Can I

325
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,730
stay with you?

326
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,460
Mu Yu, it's inappropriate for us to stay together

327
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
since we just met.

328
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,770
Please.

329
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,630
Soon we'll get to know each other.

330
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,730
Well,

331
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,850
fine.

332
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,450
Don't you think he's fat?

333
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,450
Fat?

334
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,410
I...

335
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,980
I look okay.

336
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,410
He's not fat.

337
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,650
Go back to sleep.

338
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
Zhu Meng,

339
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,970
Why did you always get up at night?

340
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,330
I kept hearing noises.

341
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,570
Get up?

342
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,630
As for my physical condition,

343
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,850
I don't need to get up.

344
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,290
Well...

345
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,180
I heard someone walking around last night.

346
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,350
I thought it was you.

347
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,650
How could it be me?

348
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,170
It wasn't me.

349
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Then who is it?

350
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,370
This looks familiar.

351
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,890
I think Zhu Meng has one too.

352
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,610
Lingling.

353
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,210
So scary.

354
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,410
Let go, let go of me.

355
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,530
You strangle me.

356
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,410
Mu Yu,

357
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,860
since it didn't kill me,

358
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,730
it doesn't want me.

359
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,770
Luckily I didn't get up to see

360
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,490
who was walking last night.

361
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,170
The guide is here.

362
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,970
We're leaving again.

363
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,410
Let's go.

364
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,610
Why is it here again?

365
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,860
Do we have to go to the pavilion for one day

366
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,990
and to the watchtower for the next day?

367
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,270
Before we find the key,

368
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,030
I guess we'll keep repeating.

369
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,690
Did you know any clues

370
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,130
before entering the door?

371
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,650
Stop testing me.

372
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,050
Even if you are a master,

373
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,710
there's a huge gap between us.

374
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,970
I just don't know

375
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,570
what the taboo conditions and keys

376
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,500
have to do with the human skin drum.

377
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,240
What do they have to do with it?

378
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I don't know.

379
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,330
But don't worry.

380
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,330
It's not too late to see it

381
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,610
before you die.

382
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,270
Let's continue to visit the pavilion today.

383
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,650
The rules are the same as before.

384
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,290
Before dark,

385
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,570
I'll pick you up.

386
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,730
The building is quite unique.

387
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,340
They are all rounds.

388
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,860
What do you think of when you see rounds?

389
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,210
Drum.

390
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,100
Since the sound of it is from upstairs,

391
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
we have to go up

392
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,010
to check the roof.

393
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,060
There're all bones.

394
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,380
I was pushed down yesterday.

395
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,530
It's too dangerous.

396
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,130
How can we survive

397
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,770
without taking the risk?

398
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,890
You're right.

399
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,570
I'll go then.

400
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,400
You've just recovered.

401
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,330
You'd better not to move around freely.

402
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,780
Besides, there are several doors forward.

403
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,850
I can't rely on you for every door.

404
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,250
Go with him.

405
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,690
Okay.

406
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,810
I...

407
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,170
What's wrong?

408
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,610
Nothing.

409
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,250
This place is scary.

410
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,480
We should get out of here quickly.

411
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,090
As for you,

412
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,970
If you don't have a constructive opinion,

413
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,570
I suggest you not mention it.

414
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,700
As usual, stay here.

415
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,730
Hui can't leave me.

416
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,850
Young man, come here.

417
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,560
Come on. Come on.

418
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,610
Come here.

419
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,530
The younger sister

420
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,180
went to a funeral with her elder sister.

421
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,010
She fell in love with a young man at the funeral.

422
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,130
When they got home,

423
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,650
the elder sister passed away suddenly.

424
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,810
Do you know why?

425
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,610
I know.

426
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,040
Isn't this a famous psychological test?

427
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,370
You know the answer?

428
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,890
This is a very old test.

429
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,290
How could I not know?

430
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,050
Lingling, come on.

431
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,170
Young man, do you want the powder?

432
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,210
Just one bite,

433
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,370
and you'll be as good as new.

434
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,420
Granny, wait for me.

435
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,680
My friends need me.

436
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,340
I'll be back for this later.

437
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,210
Be careful.

438
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,970
Come down if anything happens.

439
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
Okay.

440
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,130
It's foggy here at noon.

441
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,330
Are we still going?

442
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,930
We have to go.

443
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,070
Like Zhu Meng said,

444
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,060
if you want to get out alive,

445
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,460
you have to take the risk.

446
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,130
Let's go.

447
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Gosh.

448
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,980
Is the material what I think it is?

449
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,450
Don't think too much.

450
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,070
It's not a normal roof anyway.

451
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,250
Let's go.

452
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,330
We seemed to hear the same drumbeats

453
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,970
that day in the little bitty stinging rain.

454
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,130
It means someone was running on the roof that day.

455
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,130
Who's there?

456
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,100
It hurts.

457
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,690
Where are you?

458
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,050
It hurts.

459
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,250
It hurts.

460
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,340
Where are you?

461
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,970
Where are you?

462
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,940
It hurts.

463
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,770
Who's there?

464
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,850
It hurts! It hurts!

465
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,450
It hurts. It hurts so much!

466
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,020
It hurts so much!

467
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,050
It hurts so much!

468
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,690
It hurts so much!

469
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,250
Why don't you play?

470
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,250
It was you.

471
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,250
I...

472
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,410
No.

473
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,530
It wasn't you.

474
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,860
She's gone! She's gone!

475
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,540
Where is she?

476
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,770
She's gone.

477
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,370
She's gone.

478
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,020
I can't find her.

479
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,740
You wrote the diary.

480
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,420
You're looking for her.

481
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,940
Bring her here.

482
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,700
Bring her here.

483
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,370
Bring her here.

484
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,260
Bring her here.

485
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,650
Bring her here.

486
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Let's go.  Qianli.

487
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,850
Move. Move.

488
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,090
I don't think my legs work yet.

489
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,090
Go!

490
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,210
Go!

491
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,410
What happened?

492
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,290
W-We saw

493
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,130
a monster

494
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,650
wearing a red wedding dress.

495
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,860
The point is she has no legs.

496
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,090
No legs?

497
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,250
Do you remember?

498
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
The drumstick.

499
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,710
I think it looks like human bones.

500
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,380
Do you mean the one Mu Yu held a few days ago?

501
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,650
Yes.

502
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,490
I suspect

503
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,420
that the diary belongs to her, too.

504
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,370
She asked me to bring her younger sister to her.

505
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,650
One, two, three. Stop.

506
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,220
Don't you feel ashamed at this age?

507
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,010
I'm still a kid.

508
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,870
Next time you meet that thing,

509
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,540
let's see if she will give you a clean death

510
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,780
for the sake of you being a child.

511
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
You mean

512
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,700
she wanted us to find her sister?

513
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
I think so.

514
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,090
But where can we find her?

515
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,090
I have no idea.

516
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,510
The younger sister went to a funeral with her elder sister.

517
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,690
She fell in love with a young man at the funeral.

518
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,180
After they went home,

519
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,690
the elder sister suddenly died.

520
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,490
The younger sister went to a funeral with her elder sister.

521
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,180
She fell in love with a young man at the funeral.

522
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,100
After they went home,

523
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,060
the elder sister died.

524
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,490
I understand.

525
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,820
The two sisters didn't get along well.

526
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,090
What do you mean?

527
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,970
This is a puzzle.

528
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,330
The answer is simple.

529
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,490
Don't you know it?

530
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,850
Of course I know.

531
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,000
I just want to test you.

532
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,180
Mu Yu, tell me the answer.

533
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,900
- What? - Look.

534
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
You don't know.

535
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,900
Ask Lingling if you don't know.

536
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,890
This

537
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,370
is a psychology test that was popular over ten years ago.

538
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,850
It is said to be a test from the FBI.

539
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,930
The purpose is to test

540
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,570
if people are psychopathic.

541
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,170
The answer

542
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,290
is the younger one

543
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,970
killed her elder sister.

544
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,570
The purpose is to meet that young man at her sister's funeral.

545
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,740
She's really a psycho.

546
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,610
You answered it too.

547
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,650
Are you a psycho?

548
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,660
I just have a wealth of knowledge, okay?

549
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,250
I just didn't expect the Spi Realm,

550
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,090
such a cool game,

551
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,630
would use such an old test.

552
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,930
So the answer is telling us

553
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,180
that legends are beautiful.

554
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,290
But in this door,

555
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,650
the sisters didn't get along well,

556
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,250
and the younger sister even killed her elder sister.

557
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,050
But the elder sister has been trying to find her younger sister.

558
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,050
Almost.

559
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,260
Let's ask her again.

560
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,090
I know.

561
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,120
The younger sister killed her elder sister.

562
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,700
This is an ancient elixir.

563
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,950
It can cure your diseases and strengthen your body.

564
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,860
It can perform a medical miracle and identify the fake from the real.

565
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,210
Is our answer right?

566
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,570
Sir,

567
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,460
would you like one?

568
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,610
Just one bite.

569
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,090
It can perform a medical miracle and identify the fake from the real.

570
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,449
Is she senile?

571
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,909
She says that all the time.

572
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,050
I want one.

573
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,090
Here, sir.

574
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,620
I-Isn't this made of bones?

575
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,889
Thank you.

576
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,750
Did you find anything back there?

577
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,810
An old lady

578
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,290
was grinding the powder.

579
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,290
I also found her.

580
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,210
A strange NPC

581
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,190
kept making me guess riddles.

582
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,850
Boss Li,

583
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,710
have you figured it out?

584
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,450
No.

585
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,010
Neither did we.

586
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,090
If only Baijie was here.

587
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,660
She is so smart.

588
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,300
She can figure it out.

589
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,190
You've never seen her.

590
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,370
How do you know she's smart?

591
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,900
I've searched all kinds of legends about her.

592
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,450
Do you want to hear it?

593
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,250
I'm not interested in the legends of my colleague.

594
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,090
I envy you

595
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,850
for working with her.

596
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,350
I'll check somewhere else.

597
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,860
I think he figured it out.

598
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,010
Bailu's boss is not an ordinary person.

599
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,850
What took you so long?

600
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,010
Did something happen just now?

601
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,820
I met the Door Ghost.

602
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,560
She's looking for her sister.

603
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,090
It's getting late. Let's go.

604
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,090
Let's meet here

605
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,010
at 8:30 am tomorrow.

606
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,820
Nine people in total.

607
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,370
Each and every one of you.

608
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,370
She...

609
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,370
Nine.

610
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,850
Why nine?

611
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,210
Aren't there ten of us?

612
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,410
Now there are ten people.

613
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,670
Tomorrow will be nine.

614
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,090
Because someone will die tonight.

615
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,820
Is this a joke?

616
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,460
Tell me.

617
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,180
Who will die tonight?

618
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,010
I'm sleepy. Go to bed early.

619
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,790
You have a cheerful attitude.

620
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,250
You won't die if you don't sleep?

621
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,610
You have a cheerful attitude,

622
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,070
and you are also arrogant.

623
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,530
Feels good.

624
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,650
Lingling.

625
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,250
You do have a cheerful attitude.

626
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,450
Do I?

627
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,680
Did you forget the blood footprints?

628
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,770
How is that possible?

629
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,130
How could I forget such an important thing?

630
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,090
Then why did you sleep like that?

631
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,090
There it is again.

632
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,930
Why does it circle around my bed?

633
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,330
I saw this in a horror movie.

634
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,290
It looks like a mysterious ceremony.

635
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,410
You and I are both sacrifices.

636
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,940
Only you are the sacrifice.

637
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,050
Mu Yu, you stayed up all night.

638
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,290
Did you see anything?

639
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,290
I didn't stay up all night.

640
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,460
I saw...

641
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,090
I dare not look, right?

642
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,510
It didn't kill you.

643
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,570
It means you didn't trigger the taboo condition.

644
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,570
The next step is finding the key

645
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,670
and get out of here.

646
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,770
Eight, nine.

647
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,770
There's really one person missing.

648
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,010
Yes.

649
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,460
I counted, and it's nine.

650
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,290
Who is missing?

651
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,250
Sorry, I got up late.

652
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,580
Let's talk outside.

653
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
Everyone.

654
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,440
We have a special situation.

655
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,890
We need to go out of here as soon as possible.

656
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,580
Who has clues to the key?

657
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,810
What about you?

658
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,620
Meng Yu doesn't have any clues.

659
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,490
Do you think I can get any?

660
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,850
Zhu Meng.

661
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,330
What are you talking about?

662
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,930
Why do you know so much?

663
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,260
Did he ask about Sister Baijie?

664
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,450
Sister?

665
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,970
I think you're Pikachu's younger brother,

666
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,970
Pizaiyang.

667
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,650
Good morning.

668
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,050
Everyone is here.

669
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,130
We can go now.

670
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,890
Is there really a mole among us?

671
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,330
Why?

672
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,930
Do I look like a freak?

673
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,850
No.

674
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,890
Lingling.

675
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,220
Do I look like a freak?

676
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,220
You don't look like.

677
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,100
What do you mean?

678
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,700
Zhu Meng, don't get me wrong.

679
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,850
That's not what I mean.

680
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,780
You are the most handsome guy here.

681
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,330
Miss Xu Jin, thank you.
