00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:27,289
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,990
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,060
Toast.

4
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,870
Toast.

5
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,350
Go. Let's go to the hospital.

6
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,789
Let's go.

7
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,430
Go!

8
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,950
Yixie, is it useful?

9
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,850
If I go to the hospital now,

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,190
I guess I can only choose a nice bed in the morgue.

11
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,350
Let's go to the hospital and control the condition, okay?

12
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,950
Go.

13
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:56,910
Go!

14
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,910
No.

15
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,430
What do you want?

16
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,710
Is this what you wanted to tell me

17
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,070
in the door?

18
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,950
I'm a jerk.

19
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,310
I'm a jerk!

20
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,390
Yixie.

21
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,240
I was too stupid.

22
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,610
I always hold you back.

23
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,630
Am I smart this time?

24
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,440
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,270
Who asked you to save me?

26
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,430
You always scold me.

27
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,630
I'm dying.

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,180
Can't you praise me?

29
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,790
You are good.

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
Qianli.

31
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,160
You're really great.

32
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,450
You are not only smart,

33
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,510
but also brave.

34
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,110
Unfortunately,

35
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,510
I can only be brave this time.

36
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,030
Lingling,

37
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,470
I'll leave Toast to you.

38
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,590
Chestnut always bullies it.

39
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,990
You can't be biased.

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't worry.

41
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,990
Sister,

42
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,640
I'll leave my horror movies to you.

43
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,830
You always said I was yelling

44
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,290
when I watched the movies.

45
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,560
I don't want your horror movies.

46
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,190
I like to see you yelling

47
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,350
when you're scared.

48
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,790
Chen Fei,

49
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,990
the information about the door you asked me to check

50
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,190
is on my computer.

51
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,670
I can't help you anymore.

52
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,550
Ruan,

53
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,150
I have nothing for you.

54
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,910
My brother is not a thing.

55
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,720
I'll leave my brother with you.

56
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,909
OK?

57
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,630
Take good care of him for me.

58
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,390
You are more likable than your brother.

59
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,190
But for your sake, I promise.

60
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,450
I'll take good care of him.

61
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,150
I shouldn't have played this game.

62
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,050
I'm a bad influence on my brother.

63
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,830
I wanted to play this game.

64
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,110
It has nothing to do with you.

65
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,350
Yixie,

66
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,550
I have nothing left for you.

67
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,830
I'll leave you the hope to live.

68
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,830
OK?

69
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,110
You must live.

70
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,990
Yixie.

71
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,200
It's been a long time since you played the Subor game with me.

72
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,720
Come on, why are you sitting there?

73
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,510
Come on, Yixie.

74
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,750
Hit the top. Top.

75
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,110
Go.

76
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,470
I like

77
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,909
this feeling.

78
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,230
♪This ridiculous fate♪

79
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,940

Listen to me.

83
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,150
♫You're on the other side♫

84
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,350

♫I'm afraid I'll do anything♫

86
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,750
It won't work if you listen to me.

It's okay.

88
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,430
I still have one more life.

89
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,550
If only

90
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,510
I could have one more life

91
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,350
in the Spi Realm,

92
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,450
then we can still be together.

Qianli.

100

Yixie.

Don't be sad.

105
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,630
Qianli.

106
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,910
Qianli! Qianli!

107
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,910

♫I know♫

122
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,470
The food is cold again.

123
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,470
I'll heat it once more.

124
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,470
Forget it.

125
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,240
You've reheated it several times.

126
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,670
Without Qianli here,

127
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,010
we don't even have the mood to eat.

128
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,590
Ask Yixie to come and eat something.

129
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,850
He's been sitting like that for two days.

130
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,790
Don't bother him.

131
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,510
Let him have some alone time.

132
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,440
He won't stay here for long.

133
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,910
Qianli is gone.

134
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,520
Yixie won't stay here anymore.

135
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,310
We should at least bid him farewell, right?

136
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,080
There have been too many partings lately.

137
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,550
Some were sudden.

138
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,950
Some happened

139
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,970
even before we got a chance to say goodbye

140
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,630
in person.

141
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,960
We should let him be.

142
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,120
When it comes to departure,

143
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,050
the later it takes place, the better.

144
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,350
I'm not screaming out loud, Yixie.

145
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,550
Are you scared?

146
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,390
Yes.

147
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,030
Don't watch it if you're scared.

148
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,790
I'm scared of the door challenges too, but I still have to take them, don't I?

149
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,910
I'm just

150
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,750
learning to be braver,

151
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,080
so that in the door challenges,

152
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,750
I won't be a burden to you

153
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,870
I'll watch it with you.

154
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,090
(Bye)

155
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,760
He still had the decency

156
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,560
to say goodbye to us.

157
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,670
He was lucky,

158
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,680
because he had a chance to say goodbye.

159
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,000
When will we take the 11th door challenge?

160
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,950
In about a month.

161
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,950
Before taking the 10th door challenge,

162
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,410
you asked me if I wanted to go home for a visit.

163
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,430
This time, don't you want to go home

164
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,160
to bid farewell to your family?

165
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,040
It wouldn't hurt to go home.

166
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,440
Do you need me to go with you?

167
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,550
It's fine if you don't wanna go home.

168
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,430
Do you have a message for your family,

169
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,890
or an arrangement to make?

170
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,270
For example,

171
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,270
you have a lot of savings.

172
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,109
Would you like to make an arrangement for them?

173
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,069
Maybe you can leave them to your family

174
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,069
as a farewell.

175
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,630
I got it.

176
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,349
I'll do it myself.

177
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,860
(Bye)

178
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,750
Can we meet up?

179
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Hello!

180
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,110
Hello.

181
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,350
Jiushi!

182
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,190
I haven't seen you for years.

183
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,790
You've grown so tall.

184
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,550
Yes.

185
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,790
Jiushi,

186
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,390
when I came down here,

187
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,000
I told my family I was taking out the trash.

188
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,750
Now I'm gonna be brief.

189
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,070
A few days ago,

190
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,710
did you and a good-looking young man

191
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,400
come to sneak a peek at me and your little sister?

192
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Yes.

193
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,720
Thank you for not coming up to us.

194
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,370
If your little sister had seen you,

195
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,870
her father would've been angry.

196
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,310
By the way,

197
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,640
that young man paid a visit to me today.

198
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,250
He gave me a bag of cash.

199
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,470
He paid you a visit?

200
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,870
I'm sorry about that.

201
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,150
I didn't know he'd come to meet you.

202
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,470
It has caused you inconveniences, right?

203
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,270
I'll give the money back to him right away.

204
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,070
The... money isn't in these bags.

205
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,190
What's inside is just some of your stuff

206
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,910
that I found days ago when I was tidying up my place.

207
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,110
These are the drawings and writing

208
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,110
you did when you were a child.

209
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,710
I thought this could be my chance to give you these.

210
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,990
Were you about to throw them away?

211
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,550
No. No.

212
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,270
We happened to arrange to meet up tonight, right?

213
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,130
I thought they'd be useful to you.

214
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,100
After all, these preserve your childhood memories.

215
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,870
Aren't those your memories too?

216
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,470
Don't you want them anymore?

217
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,350
Well...

218
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,450
It's improper for me to keep them.

219
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,800
Look, my family lives in a small apartment

220
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,270
that can't spare any room for these.

221
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,190
Oh, right.

222
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,350
I didn't bring the money with me.

223
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,270
Would you hear what I think?

224
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,710
Jiushi, since I got remarried,

225
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,810
my new family has had many hard times.

226
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,740
After giving birth to your half sister,

227
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,960
none of my jobs could last.

228
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,830
Your sister's young, and she hasn't finished school.

229
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,150
About that money...

230
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,430
Would you think of it as a loan

231
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,530
I've taken from you?

232
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,600
That's not my money.

233
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,870
Don't worry.

234
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll tell my friend.

235
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,640
I told him to leave that money to...

236
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,390
to his own family.

237
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm also surprised that he'd come to meet you.

238
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,390
I guess he doesn't have a family either.

239
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,030
Don't worry.

240
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,680
I won't come here again.

241
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,350
No...

242
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,710
Your trash

243
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,160
has all been cleared.

244
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,790
Jiushi!

245
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,810
(Calls) (Contacts) (Service Center)

246
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,480
(Ruan Lanzhu)

247
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,730
(Ruan)

248
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,560
(Ruan Lanzhu)

249
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,910
(Brilliant)

250
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,990
Handsome, right?

251
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,710
What are you showing me?

252
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
A magazine?

253
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,010
You don't understand.

254
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,690
All of these are celebrities.

255
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,900
Wait.

256
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,510
Didn't we say we'd be game designers?

257
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,350
Virtual reality.

258
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,790
The Spi Realm, right?

259
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,350
Why are you showing me those celebrities now?

260
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,230
Shouldn't we read about programming,

261
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,490
or things related to computers instead?

262
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,130
Now we're learning to manage variables.

263
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,110
We aren't qualified technicians yet.

264
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,750
Let's improve our aesthetic sense first.

265
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,590
When we develop games in the future,

266
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,590
won't we need to create characters?

267
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,470
We might not be trusted with the important ones,

268
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,390
but we'll at least design some NPCs, right?

269
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,390
We must make the NPCs look nice.

270
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,830
If they are shaped like ugly beasts,

271
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,290
who's gonna play the game?

272
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,630
That makes sense.

273
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,070
Then what should our ideal character be like?

274
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,470
He's gonna be tall.

275
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,150
I want him to be 1.8 meters tall.

276
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,510
Okay. He'll be 1.8 meters tall.

277
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,770
He'll also be as handsome as a movie star.

278
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,030
He'll have great eyesight.

279
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,060
It'll have to be extraordinarily good.

280
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,710
He'll have shrewd eyes like an eagle, and sharp ears like a wolf.

281
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,380
He can run as fast as a leopard, and be as strong as a bear.

282
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,550
He'll be endowed with one ability first.

283
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,670
Then we'll continue to upgrade his other abilities.

284
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,710
He's gonna be an orphan too.

285
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,160
He won't have a family, or anyone to care about.

286
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,430
He won't even have a mother to turn to for help.

287
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,470
Do we have to make his life so tragic?

288
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,390
What do you know?

289
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,670
He'll be handsome, strong, and unfortunate.

290
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,910
Heroes are usually alone with no parents.

291
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,950
See, both Superman and Batman have no family.

292
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,030
The Monkey King, Sun Wukong, is the same.

293
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,290
He's born from a stone.

294
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,550
As I heard,

295
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,870
some foreign game designers

296
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,920
would add interesting elements

297
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,180
to their game designs.

298
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,230
I wanna do the same.

299
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,950
What kind of element do you plan to add?

300
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,630
A dramatic personality.

301
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,510
It's best if the leading character is a drama queen.

302
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,910
If both of us have some acting skills

303
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,110
just like those celebrities,

304
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,510
our parents would pay more attention to us.

305
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm injured and in pain.

306
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,680
Jiushi, can you carry me down the hill?

307
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,750
I've gotta help the others.

308
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,670
There are so many of them. What would they need you for?

309
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670
Fine.

310
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Hop up.

311
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,190
Ouch!

312
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,350
Be gentle.

313
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,870
It's a deal now. That's the character we'll create.

314
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,230
Sure.

315
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,190
Alright. It's all set.

316
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,110
Anything wrong?

317
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,950
How did you get that scar on your back?

318
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,700
(Random deduction about the rules of the 12th door)

319
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,920
(Is there any information about the props inside the door? Urgently needed.)

320
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,390
I'm a freshman, brother.

321
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,710
(I'm a freshman, brother.)

322
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,030
What did you withdraw?

323
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,070
I sent a file to my colleague.

324
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,200
I sent it by mistake.

325
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,880
(Heh-heh)

326
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,030
Who is it?

327
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,430
Why are you here?

328
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,510
I want you to investigate someone for me.

329
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,510
Who?

330
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,830
Ruan Lanzhu.

331
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,950
Ah?

332
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,430
Why do you want to investigate him?

333
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,710
None of your business,

334
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,350
just do it.

335
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,070
Otherwise, I'll tell your honey

336
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,910
how much your monthly salary is.

337
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,110
You...

338
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,680
(Mr. Air)

339
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,240
(Personal Information Form)

340
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,880
It's not him.

341
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
(Birthplace, Dongjiang City First People's Hospital)

342
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,280
(Personal Information Form)

343
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
It's not him.

344
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,950
This isn't him either.

345
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
(Ruan Lanzhu)

346
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,710
There are three people with this name in the whole country,

347
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,020
but none of them is him.

348
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,790
What's going on with you two?

349
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,590
Weren't you getting along fine?

350
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,560
He's involved in fraud?

351
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,810
Have you been sitting here all night?

352
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,110
Where is Ling Jiushi?

353
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,030
Is he back?

354
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,360
He's not in his room.

355
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
You're back.

356
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,630
What's wrong?

357
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,310
What happened?

358
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,670
What is the clue to the 11th door?

359
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,510
I don't know yet.

360
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,070
It's unsolvable.

361
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,830
Ruan Lanzhu,

362
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,990
what is the clue to the 11th door?

363
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,400
I don't know.

364
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,870
Let me ask you again.

365
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,950
What is the clue to the 11th door?

366
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,160
Please answer me,

367
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,550
NPC.

368
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,070
What do you call Ruan?

369
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,630
I'm indeed an NPC.

370
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,520
I don't understand.

371
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,470
You are an NPC in the game,

372
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,550
a character created by the game creator.

373
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,750
I should have known all of this earlier,

374
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,910
but why did I forget it?

375
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,410
I used to think Gao Dawei asked for my help

376
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,420
to destroy this game

377
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,930
by entering the 12th door.

378
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,430
Now I finally understand

379
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,190
that he wanted me to assist you to the 12th door.

380
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,030
You, Ruan Lanzhu, are the key to the game.

381
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,150
I'm sorry.

382
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,510
I won't enter the 11th door.

383
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,190
I always thought I could hide it from you until the end,

384
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,830
until I disappeared.

385
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,910
Now, this situation is the last thing I want to see.

386
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,710
That's right.

387
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,430
Yes, I am the NPC who purifies this game.

388
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,290
Only when I enter the last door

389
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,230
can this game return to its original state.

390
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:30,950
(Personal Information: Lin Qiushi)

391
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,770
(Personal Information: Lin Qiushi)

392
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,510
I am your exclusive NPC.

393
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,310
My task began

394
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,070
the moment you entered the game.

395
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,950
So in your programming,

396
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,930
it's all about waiting to meet me,

397
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,040
and this final meeting is also the last farewell.

398
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,630
Ruan,

399
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,430
You're the NPC in this game.

400
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,239
Well, that's just a simplified way of putting it.

401
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,429
The reality is a bit more complex.

402
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,270
It's okay. Go ahead.

403
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
I can understand.

404
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,030
Tell me.

405
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,590
You've been deceiving me for so long,

406
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,989
I should be able to understand, right?

407
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,719
Ling Jiushi.

408
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,070
Explain it to me!

409
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,429
Explain it to me!

410
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,150
Ruan Lanzhu, explain it to me!

411
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,179
Calm down.

412
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,530
I don't know what I can explain to you.

413
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,679
Do you want me to tell you

414
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,710
that I'm just a programming?

415
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,630
I came with a mission.

416
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,630
Once the mission is over, I'll cease to exist forever.

417
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,570
I appeared because of you,

418
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,810
and I'll disappear because of you.

419
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,949
Do you remember

420
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,110
when you asked me

421
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,450
what my plans were after the end of the Spi Realm?

422
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,830
I replied that

423
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,890
I dare not think about things so far away,

424
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,270
because

425
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,310
I have no future,

426
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,240
and I don't even have a past,

427
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,150
as I am derived from big data.

428
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,030
I have all the data about you.

429
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,630
Whatever you ask,

430
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,320
I can quickly find the answer.

431
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,650
But it's just a cold, impersonal answer.

432
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,190
Lu Yanxue once asked me what love is.

433
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
I could answer

434
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,470
that love is between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,

435
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,030
but I can never experience

436
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,390
the anticipation before transformation,

437
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,790
because I am virtual.

438
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,350
Chen Fei asked me what friendship is.

439
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,670
The search engine told me

440
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,590
that however deep the Lake of Peach Blossoms may be,

441
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,830
it's not as deep as the love Wang Lun has for me.

442
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,280
But I can never understand

443
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,480
why friendship is deeper than the lake,

444
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,630
because I am virtual.

445
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,160
This is not data of the same dimension,

446
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,160
I can't understand these answers.

447
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,750
Is it

448
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,510
just because I'm virtual?

449
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,490
Virtual and reality don't communicate,

450
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,960
that's what I've always believed.

451
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,510
So, I feel confused. I feel indifferent.

452
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,550
But until I met you,

453
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,630
I saw you willing to risk everything for those virtual Door Ghosts,

454
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,750
virtual NPCs,

455
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,710
unafraid of life or death, disregarding gains and losses,

456
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,110
all for that glimmer of light in your heart.

457
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,830
So I appreciate you.

458
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,450
I'm grateful for gradually making me feel real,

459
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,770
for making me feel like

460
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,430
at least I appear to be a person.

461
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,230
So, I could feel sad for Li Dongyuan,

462
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,690
and I could also make sacrifices for Tan Zaozao,

463
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,770
and I could even feel heartbroken

464
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,230
for Cheng Qianli.

465
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,430
The answer states

466
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,430
that reality and virtuality are opposite,

467
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,150
but both

468
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,830
exist in me,

469
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,110
so I can't explain anything.

470
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,870
Ling Jiushi,

471
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,830
not all answers

472
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,950
can resolve inner doubts.

473
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,390
You are fake, but time is real.

474
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,030
I can't distinguish between reality and virtuality anymore.

475
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,710
What's the use of distinguishing between them?

476
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,330
Actually, it's fine not being able to distinguish.

477
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,840
You can take your time to think about it

478
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,630
and make your choice.

479
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,110
What choice?

480
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,310
Is it to save someone I know,

481
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,630
or to save a group of players I don't know?

482
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,880
What kind of bullshit choice it is!

483
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,170
Let me ask you again.

484
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,390
What is the clue to the 11th door?

485
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,670
Two leave, one returns.

486
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,630
Which one of us goes, will die.

487
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,950
Isn't it obvious?

488
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,550
Do I have a choice?

489
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,150
Do I have a choice in this kind of situation?

490
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,150
Have I ever made a choice?

491
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,390
Like you,

492
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,150
I've never had a choice

493
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,130
from appearing to disappearing.

494
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,990
I'm sorry.

495
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,090
I can't let you die.

496
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,000
I won't enter the 11th door.

497
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,430
Even if you don't go, my end will be the same.

498
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,910
But it won't be the same for me.
