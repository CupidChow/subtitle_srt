00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:27,430
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,020
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,440
Did you see that?

4
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,509
What?

5
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,870
The bloody handprint behind the cabinet.

6
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,470
No.

7
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,470
I did.

8
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,750
No problem.

9
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,390
Even if you had seen it, it wouldn't have made a difference.

10
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,789
That's double standard.

11
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,509
Why did you come back so quickly?

12
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,640
What was the sound coming from inside?

13
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,589
Nothing.

14
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,430
The filing cabinet tipped over.

15
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,670
The filing cabinet tipped over?

16
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,789
Are you okay?

17
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Did the person who just went in do it?

18
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,800
The person who just went in?

19
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,230
Did someone else enter the archive?

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,230
Yeah.

21
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,500
A girl.

22
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,590
She looked like a student.

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,000
I thought she was there to help.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,550
By the way, I might have seen it wrong,

25
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,390
but it looked like she went in there jumping.

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,390
Jumping?

27
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,510
Okay.

28
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,829
Her way of walking was particularly strange.

29
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,890
Didn't you see her?

30
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,110
No.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,350
What did that girl look like?

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,070
She looks young,

33
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,230
with long hair.

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,110
Other than the weird way she walks,

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,990
nothing stands out.

36
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,250
Just an ordinary girl.

37
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,350
That must be her.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,110
Who?

39
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,170
Congratulations.

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,630
You're the first person to encounter the Door Ghost

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,750
and survive.

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,190
With your luck,

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,000
you'll surely get double experience points.

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,150
What?

45
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,950
I don't want it at all.

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,190
Stop teasing her.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,510
If it weren't for Zhuang waiting outside,

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,880
we wouldn't even know what the Door Ghost looks like.

49
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,710
You are truly a person with love.

50
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,830
Now, I think

51
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,390
Lingling and Baijie are more reliable.

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,110
You know

53
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,510
that my heart belongs to Baijie only.

54
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,630
Let's go.

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,670
We should go and find that student.

56
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,170
I need to use the restroom.

57
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,310
Me too.

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,400
(Restroom)

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,670
Meng Yu.

60
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,629
Let go.

61
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,710
Spit it out.

62
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,870
Lingling, just be honest with me.

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,790
How far have you and Baijie gone?

64
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,230
I...

65
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,910
Nothing happened between us.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,190
Why don't you believe me?

67
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,550
Then why does Zhu Meng always say

68
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,410
that he hopes you two be together?

69
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,910
He's just testing you.

70
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,790
Are you stupid? Can't you see it?

71
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,390
Really?

72
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,590
Yes.

73
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,110
Why would I lie to you?

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,710
I don't like Baijie.

75
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,200
I like someone else.

76
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,290
You're quite cunning.

77
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,280
Why didn't you reveal

78
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,079
this information to me earlier?

79
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,710
Let me ask you.

80
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,470
You haven't even met Baijie.

81
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,730
Why did you fall in love at first sight based on just a photo?

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,130
You don't understand.

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,110
Sometimes, with just one glance,

84
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,270
one can tell that this person is the one.

85
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,390
Aren't you worried that she might have a quirky personality?

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
No.

87
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,710
I can read faces.

88
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,550
The moment I saw Baijie,

89
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,350
I could tell she's a person with a pure heart,

90
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,030
just like her name suggests.

91
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,930
"Bai" means white, and "Jie" means pure.

92
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,380
Just enjoy it on your own.

93
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,840
I need to use the restroom.

94
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,790
Disgusting.

95
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,350
Are you done?

96
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,480
I've already told you I don't like her.

97
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,990
Yu Lingling,

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,430
are there any writings on your walls?

99
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,940
(Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little)

100
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,470
(She likes bananas very much, but each time she'd only eat half of one banana. What a poor thing!)

101
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,270
Are there any writings on your walls?

102
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,350
I actually don't know how to read.

103
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,590
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,110
(Would you give me yours?)

105
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,060
When I was young, my family was poor,

106
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,350
and I didn't learn many words.

107
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,670
Why don't you come in and read it yourself?

108
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,670
You're indeed interesting.

109
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,670
(Restroom)

110
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,710
What happened to you?

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
His kidneys are weak.

112
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,400
My kidneys are weak.

113
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,150
How long have I been in there?

114
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,350
For over ten minutes.

115
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,030
I just encountered Sako again in there.

116
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,630
This girl is so naughty.

117
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,390
She actually went into the men's room.

118
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,670
Is that the point?

119
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,630
Is Sako still nearby?

120
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,470
Possibly.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,150
She imitated Meng Yu's voice just now

122
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,270
and asked me to read the words on the wall.

123
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,480
If I didn't know the clues,

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,670
I might have read them.

125
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,400
Let's go inside and take a look.

126
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,110
The men's room?

127
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,310
I...

128
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,710
So much blood.

129
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,310
Did someone die here?

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
This blood should be from that Sako.

131
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,640
Didn't she have a car accident?

132
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,950
It was from her severed leg.

133
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,550
It seems that this Sako has a lot of resentment.

134
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,080
Now that we know the taboo conditions,

135
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,850
just don't read it out.

136
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,270
If it were someone who doesn't know the taboo conditions,

137
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,000
they might have fallen victim.

138
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,350
Should we

139
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,909
tell others about this?

140
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,010
You are quite kind.

141
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,310
Did I hear it right?

142
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,910
Did you praise me just now?

143
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,270
Kinda.

144
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,360
What are you looking at?

145
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,510
I'm checking to see if we can encounter

146
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,910
that senior high student from last time.

147
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,640
Stop looking and eat your food.

148
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,470
He was very resistant to us last time.

149
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,330
He probably won't come to the cafeteria for a while.

150
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,110
Eat more.

151
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,240
You didn't eat much for breakfast.

152
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,430
I'm done eating.

153
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,390
I have no appetite.

154
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,830
Meng Yu,

155
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm still hungry.

156
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,670
Can you buy me some chicken legs?

157
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,990
Why don't you go yourself?

158
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,190
I never expected

159
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,740
that my sister's future boyfriend

160
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,440
would be such a stingy guy.

161
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,520
How many do you want?

162
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,590
Two.

163
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,270
Meng, I want chicken legs too.

164
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,270
Three.

165
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,550
Four.

166
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,550
Five.

167
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,750
Six.

168
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,870
You... Seven!

169
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,070
Come on.

170
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,990
Why are you competing?

171
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,750
Can you really finish all the chicken legs?

172
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,150
Of course.

173
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,830
No matter how much, I can eat it all.

174
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,360
I don't gain weight easily.

175
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,840
Sis, your waist is quite thick, isn't it?

176
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,230
Baijie has a very slim waist.

177
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,230
I can finish it.

178
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,430
I'm not fat at all.

179
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,230
I'll go and buy the chicken legs.

180
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,350
Thank you, Meng Yu.

181
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,310
Please, enjoy.

182
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,090
Shall we go to the teaching building to find him?

183
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,590
No hurry.

184
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,210
He might be hiding somewhere now.

185
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,190
He will show up

186
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,960
when the class is about to begin.

187
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,510
The sunshine is lovely today.

188
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,240
You should learn how to balance work and leisure.

189
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,710
What you are doing is not balancing work and leisure.

190
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,910
You just ate too much.

191
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,510
Impressive.

192
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,130
You even brought this out.

193
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,390
Your hand can not only open the lock, but also...

194
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,390
I'm not a thief.

195
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,990
Can you see the mist on their faces?

196
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,910
I can't.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,530
It's none of your business.

198
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,030
I can't see it.

199
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,270
Fine.

200
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,830
I'll get you a bottle of water.

201
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,830
Thank you.

202
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,510
(Archive)

203
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,430
Purified water.

204
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,990
Thanks.

205
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,430
What took you so long?

206
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,850
I ran into Jiang Xinhong just now.

207
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,850
I followed him for a while before realizing I had the wrong person.

208
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,000
You really can't see it?

209
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
I really can't.

210
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,150
Just like

211
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,680
you can hear things I can't,

212
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,430
I can see things you can't.

213
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,350
Let's go.

214
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,720
Throw it away for me.

215
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
Okay.

216
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,710
Throw it away for him.

217
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Are they all on a lunch break?

218
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,670
No.

219
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,680
I can hear that their teacher is giving a lecture.

220
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,210
Final exams are coming up.

221
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,810
Everyone is working hard.

222
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,590
Why can't I hear it?

223
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
You've got really good hearing.

224
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,150
Alright, classmates.

225
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,110
That's it for today's class.

226
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
Class dismissed.

227
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,510
Goodbye, sir.

228
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,070
Jiang Xinhong.

229
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,190
Can we have a talk, please?

230
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,190
About what?

231
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,760
Let's talk somewhere else.

232
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,830
I don't know anything.

233
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,570
I didn't ask anything.

234
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,160
Why are you so sure that you don't have the answer?

235
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,520
Feel free to ask any questions.

236
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,830
I have a class to attend shortly.

237
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,180
We are investigating something related to your class.

238
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,520
More specifically, your previous class.

239
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,870
What's the name of the person missing in the photo?

240
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,860
Where did you get it from?

241
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,470
Is there anything special about this photo?

242
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,330
I don't understand what you mean.

243
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,310
We don't want to trouble you.

244
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,390
We just want to know

245
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,450
who the person missing in the photo is

246
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,750
and what her name is.

247
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't you want everything to be over soon?

248
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,450
Don't you want to return to normal life as soon as possible?

249
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,630
Sachiko.

250
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,030
Sachiko?

251
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,630
Yes.

252
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,310
It's her.

253
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,720
A person who shouldn't have been in our class.

254
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,150
I have to go back to class now.

255
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,430
So close.

256
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,750
Forget it.

257
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,430
Since he doesn't want to tell us,

258
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,230
let's look for clues elsewhere.

259
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,270
We need to ask that teacher.

260
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,599
I don't know if you've noticed.

261
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,710
The teacher in the photo

262
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,869
is the one who brought us in, Mr. Liu.

263
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,710
Lingling, you're really impressive. You're so smart.

264
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,710
Let's go.

265
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,910
Sachiko

266
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,950
died over two years ago.

267
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,270
Wait.

268
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,790
Why aren't you measuring the building

269
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,120
and instead inquiring about our student?

270
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,590
We encountered many strange occurrences

271
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,520
while measuring the old building.

272
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,790
Besides,

273
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,830
it is said that many students have died

274
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,360
in that teaching building.

275
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,750
Those were all accidents.

276
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,490
You should know better than us

277
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,110
whether those were accidents.

278
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,280
What exactly do you want to ask?

279
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,230
What kind of person was Sachiko?

280
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,830
Sachiko...

281
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,250
was a rather inconspicuous student.

282
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,910
Moreover, she didn't belong here at all.

283
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,350
Why?

284
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,510
Our school only admits

285
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,190
students from elite families.

286
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,990
Her family sells fish.

287
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,110
But they actually sent their child here for education.

288
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,110
Is the tuition here very expensive?

289
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,870
For an average family,

290
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,640
it's simply unaffordable.

291
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,510
Then, considering that Sachiko's family

292
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,230
only runs a small business selling fish,

293
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,470
how did they manage to afford the large sum of money

294
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,640
required to send their daughter to this school?

295
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,430
How is her relationship with her classmates?

296
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,960
A student of her background

297
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,070
could never have friends

298
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,350
in our school.

299
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,390
She carried a strong fishy smell every day,

300
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,950
which was completely out of place

301
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,350
in our environment.

302
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,320
Is that why she was not included during the group photo that day?

303
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,750
That was just a photo.

304
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,400
Can you tell us about the car accident?

305
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,440
It was...

306
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,430
after an outing in Grade 10, I think.

307
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,910
She had a car accident on the highway

308
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,630
when she was going home alone.

309
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,790
Her leg was severed by the truck,

310
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,920
and she died from excessive bleeding.

311
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,390
What about the truck driver?

312
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,540
Didn't he help her?

313
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,810
The driver fled after realizing he had hit someone.

314
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,190
But he was later caught

315
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,790
and paid a large sum of money.

316
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,350
It was because you all isolated Sachiko

317
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,750
that she came back

318
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,230
to seek revenge after her death.

319
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,570
How could you say that?

320
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,950
This

321
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,670
is a progressive school.

322
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,150
How could there be

323
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,080
such superstitions? It's feudal.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,270
But many people died there.

325
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,430
Are you done?

326
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,920
I am about to go to class.

327
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,510
Don't delay my lesson preparation, okay?

328
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,510
Thank you.

329
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,750
If there are any questions in the future,

330
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,880
we will come to consult with you again.

331
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,040
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

332
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,250
Nothing.

333
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,350
It's just that...

334
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,300
I received too much news in one day.

335
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,100
I need time to process it slowly.

336
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Take your time.

337
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,490
We still have time.

338
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,990
It seems that Mr. Liu

339
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,550
doesn't like Sachiko.

340
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,430
For now,

341
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,790
we've only learned some things about Sachiko

342
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,990
when she was alive.

343
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,090
As for other information,

344
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,520
he provided too little.

345
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,090
It looks like tomorrow

346
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,960
we'll have to have a good talk with Jiang Xinhong.

347
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,750
It seems that Sachiko wasn't happy

348
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,010
living in this school.

349
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,670
Children from poor families

350
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,130
are never happy anywhere.

351
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,770
Let's go. The canteen is serving dinner.

352
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,950
If we go late, there won't be any food left.

353
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,070
Again? You just ate.

354
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,990
What can I do?

355
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,270
No matter how much I eat, I don't gain weight.

356
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,930
Unlike you,

357
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,830
with just a little food, your face will be all chubby.

358
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,200
You...

359
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I agree.

360
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,640
(Canteen)

361
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,380
Hello, my name is Luo Xiaoyu.

362
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,180
I entered the door with you guys.

363
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,790
Is there something wrong?

364
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,230
Well, I have a teammate named Nie Cheng.

365
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,510
He hasn't come back.

366
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,390
Where did he go?

367
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,510
The old building.

368
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,850
I went to the restroom,

369
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,950
and when I came out, he was gone.

370
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,430
I searched the entire teaching building

371
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,690
but couldn't find him.

372
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,430
Later, I got scared,

373
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,950
so I came back.

374
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,050
It seems we can't go to the toilet easily inside the door.

375
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,960
Either people die in there

376
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,470
or they lose their partner

377
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,150
after coming out.

378
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,510
I've looked everywhere in the campus

379
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,070
but couldn't find him.

380
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,830
It's late now.

381
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,150
We mustn't search for people at night.

382
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,670
You should have a good rest tonight.

383
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,270
Tomorrow, we'll accompany you to look for him.

384
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,870
By the way,

385
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,190
that old building is really scary.

386
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,700
Are you really going there tomorrow?

387
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,030
You know that person is already...

388
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,390
Seeing how concerned she is about Nie Cheng,

389
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,790
I just want to help her stop lingering on it.

390
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,430
I was right about you.

391
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,990
Since you are like this, as your sister,

392
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,670
Baijie must be kinder

393
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,190
and more considerate than you.

394
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,270
Such a sweet talker.

395
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,270
Of course.

396
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,550
Enough.

397
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,640
All you've been talking about is Baijie.

398
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,830
It's so annoying.

399
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,070
I really want to get out of this door.

400
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,630
Me too.

401
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,710
So that I can see Baijie earlier.

402
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,710
Today,

403
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,310
we got quite a few clues.

404
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,630
For example,

405
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,950
Sachiko was isolated and bullied

406
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,390
by classmates in school.

407
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,590
I remember when we just entered,

408
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,670
Mr. Liu mentioned

409
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,200
that they were about to take exams.

410
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,550
Yes, he did.

411
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,430
Considering the current weather, it's definitely not winter,

412
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,890
so it can't be final exams.

413
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,310
So,

414
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,310
are you saying

415
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,660
it's the graduation exam?

416
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,830
Yes.

417
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,510
This is a crucial time.

418
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,520
Once they graduate,

419
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,440
they will no longer be students of this school.

420
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,920
Then, that makes the graduation exam

421
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,750
our deadline.

422
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,510
What if...

423
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
What if we haven't found the key by then?

424
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,630
We've already know what the result will be.

425
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,760
Time is running out.

426
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,110
Don't worry.

427
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,310
With me and my brother-in-law here,

428
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,990
we will go out safely.

429
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,430
I don't have the confidence of the White Deer's Chief.

430
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,230
Let's stop here. Go to bed early.

431
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,970
Lingling, good night.

432
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,150
Good night.

433
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Zhu Meng.

434
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,350
Come out.

435
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,990
Do you want to know the truth?

436
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,720
Come out.

437
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,180
Do you want to know the truth?

438
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,750
Come out.

439
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,830
Do you want to know the truth?

440
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,070
Come out.

441
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,590
Do you want to know the truth?

442
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,590
Come out.

443
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,830
Do you want to know the truth?

444
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,990
Come out.

445
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,190
Do you want to know the truth?

446
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,550
Come on.

447
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,180
Do you want to know the truth?

448
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,350
Sako?

449
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,190
You really can't read?

450
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,990
Liar.

451
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,830
You all love to lie.

452
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,430
Come on.

453
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,830
Don't you want to know the truth?

454
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,630
Why don't any of you like me?

455
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,830
Why don't you want to be friends with me?

456
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,470
We like you.

457
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,830
Liar.

458
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,790
You're all the same,

459
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,390
liking to tell lies.

460
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:45,310
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

461
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,540
That's hilarious.

462
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,110
She likes bananas very much,

463
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,950
but each time she can only eat half of one banana.

464
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,390
What a poor thing!

465
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,470
Sako has gone far away.

466
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,990
She'll forget me, won't she?

467
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,950
So lonely, Sako.

468
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,190
I've lost my legs.

469
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,310
Would you give me yours?

470
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,830
I've lost my legs.

471
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,350
Why aren't you singing with them?

472
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,310
Even if you can't read,

473
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,830
you can still sing along.

474
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,390
Who heard crows singing?

475
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,410
Who saw the snowflakes drifting?

476
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,990
Who was abandoned in the middle of the road?

477
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,620
Who escaped in a hurry?

478
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,910
What's the last lyric?

479
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,830
Sing it for me.

480
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,200
I've lost my legs.

481
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,870
Would you give me yours?

482
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,870
I've lost my legs.

483
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,990
Would you give me yours?

484
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,980
I've lost my legs

485
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,340
Would you give me yours?

486
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,950
Your soul is now empty

487
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,600
I've lost my legs

488
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,940
Who saw the snowflakes drifting?

489
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,970
Who was abandoned in the middle of the road?

490
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,110
Would you give me yours?

491
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,790
I've lost my legs.

492
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,630
Would you give me yours?

493
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,550
I've lost my legs.

494
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,950
Would you give me yours?

495
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,940
I've lost my legs

496
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,620
Would you give me yours?

497
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,030
My soul is now empty

498
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,710
I've lost my legs

499
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,110
Would you give me yours?

500
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,080
Your soul is now empty

501
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,350
What happened to you?

502
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,950
I-I...

503
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,670
I saw Sako.

504
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,750
And then?

505
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,870
There were students singing over and over.

506
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,330
She asked me to sing along.

507
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,110
She told me to sing,

508
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,190
but I didn't.

509
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,190
I didn't sing.

510
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,750
Go on.

511
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,280
When she was about to attack me,

512
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,360
she suddenly disappeared.

513
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,350
Disappeared?

514
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,590
Usually,

515
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,390
Door Ghosts wouldn't easily let their targets go.

516
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,910
What did you do and say at that time?

517
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,400
Nothing at all.

518
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,390
I was trying to escape.

519
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,790
That's odd.

520
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,310
I accidentally entered a room,

521
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,550
where there was a kaleidoscope.

522
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,230
It looked exactly the same as the one

523
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,990
I had seen in the School Archive in the afternoon.

524
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,190
I don't know how it ended up in that room.

525
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,350
A kaleidoscope?

526
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,080
What kaleidoscope?

527
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,030
Is it a prop that can help us solve this door challenge?

528
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,030
Take me there.

529
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,720
Aren't you gonna sleep?

530
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,510
It... Wait.

531
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,230
Why is it gone?

532
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,010
Were you mistaken?

533
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,340
How could it be possible?

534
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,800
I put it back there myself.

535
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,110
Is it possible that Sako took it away?

536
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,430
Sachiko chose not to kill him

537
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,990
so that she could grab the kaleidoscope before he did?

538
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,190
That's impossible.

539
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,870
Let's go back to our room,

540
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,870
and take a rest.

541
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,090
We need to look for Nie Cheng tomorrow.

542
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,560
He's been missing for a day and a night.

543
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,550
I guess he's forever gone.

544
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,030
Are you saying

545
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,550
that he's dead?

546
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,430
Should he be alive,

547
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,190
he couldn't have spent one night on the old teaching building.

548
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,750
Wait.

549
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,280
You mean a living soul has just vanished into thin air like that?

550
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,110
On which floor were you when he went missing?

551
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,750
The fourth floor.

552
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,480
We were in a classroom at the end of the fourth floor.

553
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,670
As I recall, it's Class 2, Grade 10.

554
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,160
(Class 2, Grade 10)

555
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,350
Do you hear any usual sounds?

556
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,750
No.

557
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,950
There are no signs of struggles.

558
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,680
The dust stays still.

559
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,550
Maybe he's gone somewhere else.

560
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,710
How were you two parted?

561
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,390
I-I just went to the toilet.

562
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,830
By the time I came back, he had been gone.

563
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,830
Something must have happened.

564
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,630
But if he were dead,

565
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,810
we would at least see his body, right?

566
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,680
Many things inside the door

567
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,100
can't be explained by common sense.

568
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,240
Why do you care so much about him?

569
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,389
What's your relationship with him?

570
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,830
I'm new to the game.

571
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,949
When I first started playing it, I was scared.

572
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,790
He helped me.

573
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,429
That aside, even if he hadn't helped me,

574
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,429
he's still a real living man, right?

575
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Whatever.

576
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,130
Let's check out the other floors.

577
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,190
Let's go.

578
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,610
(High School Algebra)

579
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,670
It's a textbook.

580
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,560
(High School Physics)

581
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,270
It's Sachiko's textbook.

582
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,510
It seems like Sachiko

583
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,270
wasn't just ignored by her classmates.

584
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,650
She was bullied by all of them.

585
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,620
One of this person's legs is broken.

586
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,480
It must have been done by Sachiko.

587
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,790
Why would Sachiko kill him?

588
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,710
What did he do?

589
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,520
Did you hear anything at that time?

590
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,550
For example,

591
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,590
was someone singing?

592
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,960
Let's see if we can find more clues.

593
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,600
(Scram)

594
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,350
You just never shower, do you?

595
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,470
Staying in the same class as you every day

596
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,730
is such a humiliation!

597
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,870
Get lost!

598
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,950
So disgusting!

599
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,790
It's an insult to be in the same class as you.

600
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,550
Get lost!

601
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,060
Just go away!

602
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,450
Every day when I see you, I'd have a headache!

603
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,350
You should get out now!

604
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,150
Why are you staring?

605
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,390
Is what I've said wrong?

606
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,430
You really stink!

607
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,960
Can't you stay away from me?

608
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,550
You're gross!

609
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,910
The entire classroom reeks of your stink!

610
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,230
You've made the classroom smelly too!

611
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,870
Can you hear that?

612
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,630
Can you hear that?

613
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,190
Lingling!

614
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,580
Lingling!

615
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,280
What's wrong? You're so quiet.

616
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,390
This seat...

617
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,030
It's Sako's.

618
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,400
How do you know that?

619
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,830
I can feel it.

620
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,670
This Certificate of Merit belongs to Sachiko.

621
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,990
I don't think we can find more clues here.

622
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,640
We still need to talk to Jiang Xinhong.

623
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,630
You should go back and take a rest.

624
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,190
The door challenges will be very dangerous for you

625
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,450
if you're in bad shape.

626
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,420
(Miss Sachiko won the first prize in this writing competition)

627
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,030
(Class 3, Grade 12)

628
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,030
Hello. Is Jiang Xinhong here today?

629
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,180
No, he's not.

630
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
He's ill, so he has taken sick leave.

631
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,430
Thank you.

632
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,190
He didn't come to school today

633
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,140
for some alleged illness.

634
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
We heard that.

635
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,590
I bet he's pretending to be sick

636
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,720
because he's afraid to come to school.

637
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,950
I wish we could leave the campus,

638
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,030
and go to his home to take a look.

639
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,630
According to the rules of this door challenge,

640
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,690
I don't think we can leave the campus.

641
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,850
Then where should we go to look for clues?

642
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,640
The School Archive.

643
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,010
Why the School Archive again?

644
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,880
Because my sixth sense says so.

645
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,990
Your sixth sense?

646
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,150
Only women have a sixth sense.

647
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,350
How come a guy like you has a sixth sense?

648
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,190
Lingling,

649
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,550
do you believe in my sixth sense?

650
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,830
Yes.

651
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,830
Me too.

652
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,680
Go! To the School Archive.

653
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,190
But...

654
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,350
Hello, sir.

655
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,850
Why would you guys come again?

656
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,440
Are you here today to check the files again?

657
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,790
Here is a reminder for you today.

658
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,350
Do not knock down the cabinets again.

659
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,350
No.

660
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,520
Today we just want to talk with you.

661
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,650
What do you have to talk with me about?

662
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,390
Didn't you claim to remember

663
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,950
whatever happened in the school?

664
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,880
We'd like to ask you about someone.

665
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,590
Who?

666
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,590
Sachiko.
