00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,380
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,920
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,590
It's so early in the morning.

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,509
You think there's a clue here?

5
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,509
Yes.

6
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,990
Let's see.

7
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,729
There must be big news.

8
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,630
Big news?

9
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,030
Forget it.

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,210
You don't even let me have breakfast.

11
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,540
Dear guests,

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,730
you're here again.

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,080
Are you going to get some medicine?

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,510
Not today.

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,190
We're here to ask you a favor.

16
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,190
Favor?

17
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,110
Go ahead. I'll do my best.

18
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,230
Please help me see

19
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,890
what medicine is in this bowl.

20
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,430
May I ask

21
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,670
why you prescribed this prescription?

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,310
I can't tell you about that.

23
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,910
Just say it.

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,670
Sorry, I can't say random things.

25
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,110
I can't help you.

26
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,510
Let's go!

27
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,030
Who said there was important information.

28
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,090
It turned out to be nothing valuable.

29
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,870
You came here

30
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,850
to verify something, didn't you?

31
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,470
Yes.

32
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,750
The fragrance of the medicine

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,830
smells exactly

34
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,580
like the tranquilizer's

35
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,980
the hysterical man took.

36
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm not a medical student.

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,630
So I came to ask.

38
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,990
The pharmacy owner wouldn't tell me.

39
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,470
I think there's something wrong.

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,470
He didn't tell you

41
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,530
because he has professional ethics.

42
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,150
I'm just worried

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,920
the medicine was fed in case the children cry.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,630
I wonder

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,600
what happened to those kids later.

46
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,890
Maybe they are as pitiful as beggars.

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,190
Yes.

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,990
But

49
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,670
this is just a game.

50
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,870
Don't be too immersed.

51
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't get confused.

52
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,230
You're right.

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,560
The more doors I've passed,

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,829
the more I can't distinguish reality from illusion.

55
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,230
I wasn't like this before.

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,310
But now I'm so emotional.

57
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,430
You're a sentimental sweet guy.

58
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,870
Don't you have a girlfriend?

59
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,430
Why are you laughing?

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,230
He...

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,030
had one before.

62
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,080
Did you break up?

63
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,230
Is your girlfriend pretty?

64
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,590
Why are you so talkative?

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,320
Don't you know it's my privacy?

66
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,790
Don't say it.

67
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,670
Let me tell you.

68
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,750
Mrs. Yu used babies' bodies to decoct lamp oil.

69
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,950
Bodies?

70
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,909
That's true.

71
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,630
All the oil lamps here

72
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,159
are made from the oil of the babies' bodies.

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,590
I don't know

74
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,360
if these oil lamps are a trap,

75
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,630
but I still think

76
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,950
it's better to tell everyone about this.

77
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,050
I think we should throw away these oil lamps.

78
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,730
They are definitely not good things.

79
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,420
Yes.

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,150
Maybe they may put us in danger.

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,590
Sometimes, what NPC said

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,310
is not the golden rule.

83
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,040
He told others everything we knew.

84
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,590
What's the purpose?

85
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,130
How could he tell others about it?

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,270
Now, everyone

87
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,030
will have concerns about body oil lamps.

88
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,120
Someone died.

89
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,159
We think it has something to do with the oil lamps.

90
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,470
But we can't be 100% sure.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,030
There are no new deaths to verify.

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,850
It became an exception that is hard to prove.

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,470
So,

94
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,030
Yan Shihe wants to experiment on people?

95
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,150
He's so evil.

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,910
I found that

97
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,230
this game

98
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,550
is inducing the evil aspects in people.

99
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,870
So I really don't know

100
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,940
why you copied this game.

101
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,670
Because it's profitable.

102
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,150
Most bosses are amateurs.

103
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,830
They are following the trend.

104
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,910
They just think

105
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,350
as long as they are smart

106
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,360
and radical,

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,390
you can get rich.

108
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,650
In fact, most people are skinny dipping.

109
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,910
Pigs that are blown to the sky by the wind

110
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,030
are still pigs.

111
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,030
Anyway,

112
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,190
Yan Shihe is not a decent man.

113
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,990
Yes.

114
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,840
There's a worse person.

115
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,750
I don't know who gave me

116
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,070
a fake key before.

117
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,330
It's not decent at all.

118
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,990
I'm the biggest victim

119
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,830
in that door, okay?

120
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,010
I'm not talking about you.

121
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,190
You're really good.

122
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,830
What happened?

123
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,730
Why is your doll crying again?

124
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,190
How is that possible?

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,670
Isn't this room

126
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,030
chosen by this doll?

127
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,310
Maybe...

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,410
someone sneaked into our room

129
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,750
and changed

130
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,510
our lamp.

131
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,790
How is that possible?

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,590
How did you know?

133
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,230
The lampshade

134
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,910
is the same as our original oil lamp.

135
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,550
But now,

136
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,330
the shape of the lampshade

137
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,790
doesn't match the shape of the lamp seat.

138
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,669
Amazing.

139
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,200
Looks like we can come to a conclusion.

140
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,630
Our original oil lamp is safe.

141
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,990
What should we do now?

142
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,590
The oil lamp in our hands

143
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,630
may be a fake one.

144
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,070
Let's go to other rooms

145
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,270
and see if there are original oil lamps.

146
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,290
There are only a few vacant rooms.

147
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,920
But no lamps were found.

148
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,790
In my opinion,

149
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,830
we can

150
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,990
share a room

151
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,990
with others.

152
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,710
What did you think of?

153
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,470
Nothing.

154
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,750
I just think

155
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,350
if we search rooms one by one,

156
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,730
we will find a university dormitory.

157
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,990
A university dormitory?

158
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,520
Come on, this is an ancient courtyard.

159
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,950
I've seen it more than once.

160
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,790
It looked exactly the same as my university dormitory.

161
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
Just like the storage room without windows

162
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,230
we saw yesterday.

163
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,750
I saw it outside the door.

164
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,240
I think this game, more or less,

165
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,880
has something to do with me.

166
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,150
I think you're just nervous.

167
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,870
When you get out,

168
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,950
ask Meng Yu to prescribe you some medicine.

169
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,210
I'll watch you have it.

170
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,190
Don't think about your college dormitory.

171
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,790
It's not the nostalgic time.

172
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,690
Why are all the oil lamps changed?

173
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,450
Someone did it on purpose.

174
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,280
If it was done by the Mrs. Yu,

175
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,320
she didn't have to change the oil lamps in vacant rooms.

176
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Yan Shihe did it?

177
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,910
I think it was him.

178
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,690
This is the only way to verify the result.

179
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,070
Oh no.

180
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,490
It's almost midnight. What should we do?

181
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,390
Let's go and keep looking for it.

182
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
What's wrong?

183
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,720
Isn't this the room we used to live in?

184
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,960
Did you notice that?

185
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,890
The doll is not crying.

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,230
Gosh.

187
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,470
You've got it correctly.

188
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,590
There really is a dormitory.

189
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,870
And it's daytime

190
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,270
in the dorm.

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,630
Lingling, look.

192
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,960
There's a human oil lamp

193
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,270
in this dorm.

194
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,870
Is the base of this lamp

195
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,670
the same shape as ours?

196
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,470
It can really save our lives.

197
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,230
Let's go.

198
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,630
What does this game have to do with you?

199
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,000
Ruan Lanzhu said you're gifted in passing doors.

200
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,910
It looks like you're in a league of your own.

201
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,430
I...

202
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,790
I was relying on my instinct.

203
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,150
I have a lot of doubts, too.

204
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,690
I can only verify them after I go out of this door.

205
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,030
Anyway,

206
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,790
we managed to escape.

207
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,470
But I've remembered

208
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,390
what Yan Shihe did this time.

209
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm too sleepy.

210
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,640
I'll deal with Yan Shihe tomorrow.

211
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,130
What are you thinking?

212
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,870
The purpose of Yan Shihe.

213
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,630
He changed our oil lamp

214
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,550
not only to verify the taboo conditions.

215
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,940
He must have known that we are both masters.

216
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,030
He wanted to destroy us.

217
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,430
I think I know who he is.

218
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,290
His background is not simple.

219
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,710
I've contacted them too.

220
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,390
They came to you

221
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,880
and tried to cooperate with us as well.

222
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,190
I didn't agree.

223
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,550
Why? The price is not reasonable?

224
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,190
I do want to make money,

225
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,870
but I have my principle.

226
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,490
I think their purpose is not that simple.

227
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,050
Otherwise, Ruan Lanzhu wouldn't...

228
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,410
What's wrong with him?

229
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,470
I mean...

230
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,850
Otherwise, Ruan Lanzhu wouldn't be so worried.

231
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,750
I've told you that within this door, I would protect you.

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,750
Don't worry.

233
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,910
You protected me

234
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,120
because he asked you to?

235
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,870
Well...

236
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,630
You guessed it out yourself.

237
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,750
I didn't tell you.

238
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,930
I wasn't sure at first.

239
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,470
I thought

240
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,390
it was just an inferior door,

241
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,230
how come the boss of White Deer came in person?

242
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,230
I knew it later.

243
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,110
Thank you.

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,480
You don't have to.

245
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,890
I didn't help you for nothing.

246
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
But...

247
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,110
I'm really lucky

248
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
to meet you guys.

249
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,090
All right, let's go to bed.

250
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,430
Sleeping like pigs do.

251
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,550
Piggy, run!

252
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,670
Those darn pigs!

253
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,710
Go away.

254
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,750
Go away, please.

255
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,950
The sky and ground are in panic.

256
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,109
We have a crying boy.

257
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,109
Repeat the gods's names three times.

258
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,510
Sleep till daylight.

259
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,630
The sky and ground are in panic.

260
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,710
We have a crying boy.

261
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,470
Repeat the gods's names three times.

262
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,630
Sleep till daylight.

263
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,990
The sky and ground are in panic.

264
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,119
We have a crying boy.

265
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,510
Repeat the gods's names three times.

266
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,069
Sleep till daylight.

267
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,230
Wake up.

268
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,550
Wake up.

269
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,270
The window is broken.

270
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,150
Why is the window broken?

271
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,070
Piggy and Mrs. Yu

272
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,160
came last night.

273
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,230
Again?

274
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,590
We missed them again.

275
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,940
Sometimes deaf people

276
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,630
are really happy.

277
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,990
If I hadn't tried that rhyme

278
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,830
at the crucial moment,

279
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,320
all three of us would have died last night.

280
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,550
What if that nursery rhyme

281
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,710
comes out dead?

282
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,290
If this nursery rhyme was a curse,

283
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
people in the town wouldn't read it.

284
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,830
That's true.

285
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,910
But being able to react immediately

286
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,030
when danger occurs

287
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,790
is extraordinary.

288
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,310
Lingling, you are awesome.

289
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,630
I think you are really something.

290
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,690
You two were sleeping like dead pigs.

291
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,550
The quality of my sleep outside

292
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,860
is quite low.

293
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,880
Maybe after coming in,

294
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,990
I don't have the KPI

295
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,440
and the pressure of buying a house,

296
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,230
so I slept well.

297
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Yes.

298
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,470
There's no KPI

299
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,120
or high housing prices.

300
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,870
Only life or death.

301
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,390
Lingling,

302
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,670
the oil lamp...

303
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,070
I accidentally knocked it over last night.

304
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,670
Then today,

305
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,670
we will have no oil lamps.

306
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,670
Do we still need to look for it in that dorm?

307
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,930
Do you think you can win

308
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,160
lottery every time?

309
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,720
There are oil lamps.

310
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,230
It depends on how to get them.

311
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,230
Gentlemen,

312
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,190
let's have breakfast first

313
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,920
and think of a way later.

314
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,550
You have to listen to me.

315
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,710
If you don't,

316
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,230
something will happen.

317
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,310
Understood?

318
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,190
Remember.

319
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,370
Someone's missing again.

320
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,710
You're late today.

321
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,830
I thought you...

322
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,680
You thought we died?

323
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,230
Why are you so sure?

324
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,190
After all, this is a world

325
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,750
where people may die at any time.

326
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,030
Yes.

327
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,630
In this world,

328
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,310
anyone could die.

329
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,110
It seems like the oil lamp can be a lifesaver.

330
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,750
Just don't throw it away, okay?

331
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,160
Who changed the oil lamp?

332
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,290
Who wants to kill us?

333
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,310
Someone wants us to die here.

334
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,010
Don't let me find out who it is.

335
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,030
What should we do?

336
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,270
What should we do?

337
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,270
I'm so scared.

338
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,270
Thinking about last night,

339
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,430
Lingling, you are really something.

340
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,600
Speaking of last night,

341
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,830
Mrs. Yu couldn't enter the room,

342
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,750
so she let Piggy in.

343
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,750
But Piggy was scared of nursery rhymes.

344
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,020
Now

345
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,310
we know that there are two taboo conditions.

346
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,310
One is

347
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,930
not using a human oil lamp,

348
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,990
leading to instant death

349
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,630
whether they're awake or asleep.

350
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,630
The other

351
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,630
is using a human oil lamp,

352
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,470
as long as someone's awake,

353
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,200
there will be a glimmer of hope.

354
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,480
Before Piggy enters the room,

355
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,840
just repeat three nursery rhymes,

356
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,070
and you will survive.

357
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,030
But our lamp has run out of oil,

358
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,850
what should we do tonight?

359
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,710
Find a way to make one.

360
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,540
How?

361
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,190
This is too hard.

362
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,630
We have to steal, right?

363
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,630
Steal?

364
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,550
Snatch it!

365
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,600
Wait, I mean,

366
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,950
we could try taking a lamp from Mrs. Yu,

367
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,910
but if she catches us

368
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,070
red handed,

369
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,040
we might end up dead on the spot.

370
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,270
Well, at least

371
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,910
it would be a quick death.

372
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,820
We can go somewhere else.

373
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,900
You mean ancestral hall?

374
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,070
It's inappropriate for us to steal things

375
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,670
from ancestral hall, right?

376
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,590
Besides, is that lamp the human oil lamp?

377
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,790
Think about it.

378
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,070
Who has

379
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,590
our oil lamp?

380
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,070
Yan Shihe.

381
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,300
Yes, he took ours.

382
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,510
Let's get it back.

383
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,520
No, I mean let's snatch it back.

384
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,090
We're entitled to do that.

385
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,350
Lock the door.

386
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,910
Hurry up.

387
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,670
Hurry up.

388
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,230
How do you know for sure that he'll hide it here?

389
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,230
At least they don't have it with them.

390
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,230
Move.

391
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,670
Let's check the room first.

392
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,830
Okay.

393
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,990
Holy moly.

394
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,990
So many?

395
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,730
He must have collected them from all over the place.

396
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,590
He even stole someone else's oil lamp.

397
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,710
He's evil!

398
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,990
(Family Genealogy)

399
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,310
Lingling.

400
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,250
The family genealogy?

401
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,440
Didn't Yan Shihe say

402
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,450
that he found a family genealogy?

403
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,550
You should take this book first.

404
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,750
Okay.

405
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,110
Hold on.

406
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,390
This would also expose

407
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,790
our sneaky entry, right?

408
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,670
He stole our oil lamp.

409
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,870
Even if he doesn't look for us,

410
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,470
we still have to go after him.

411
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,580
Don't worry about being exposed.

412
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,310
Put this in your bag for backup.

413
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,070
As for the rest,

414
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,270
hide them in a corner.

415
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,100
Where should we hide

416
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,030
the remaining lamps?

417
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,770
(Yu) (Yu Yuancheng)

418
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,190
(Yu Guangyu) (Yu Guangqing) (Yu Guanglan)

419
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,140
This doesn't look like a family genealogy.

420
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,550
It's thickly dotted,

421
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,200
more like a ledger.

422
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,830
A ledger?

423
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,200
Is it because they have too much money?

424
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,070
(Zhang Zhihong) (Zhang Wenyu)

425
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,550
Look.

426
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,990
These names

427
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,350
look familiar.

428
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,670
It looks like the memorial tablets

429
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,270
we saw in the ancestral hall.

430
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,430
I've seen a few.

431
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,530
It's indeed the names on the tablets.

432
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,230
What are these numbers?

433
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
If

434
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,930
these children were not sacrificed,

435
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,020
would she sell them?

436
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,070
These numbers represent income.

437
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,110
Your assumption

438
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,430
is quite bold.

439
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,950
Did she raise all these kids?

440
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,870
It must be tough

441
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,000
to hide so many kids.

442
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
It seems

443
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,670
we should focus on

444
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,230
those missing children.

445
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,930
Let's look for more clues.

446
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,990
You're so...

447
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,320
You guys are getting more and more like me.

448
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,870
You showed your leadership
since this is your first time entering the door alone.

449
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,870
Enough.

450
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,830
It's time for lunch. Let's get started after lunch.

451
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,830
Let's go.

452
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,750
Come on, come on.

453
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,550
Have you guys been in the yard all morning?

454
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,170
I found some dirty stuff here.

455
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,510
What's up?

456
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,870
Nothing. I'm just asking.

457
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,990
Brother.

458
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,350
Did they

459
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,640
take the lamp and the genealogy book?

460
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,560
Who else could it be?

461
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,390
The others in this door are all useless,

462
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,390
including you.

463
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,990
If you had agreed to bring the oil lamp and the genealogy,

464
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,390
things wouldn't have been so complicated.

465
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,310
What should we do now?

466
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,070
When shepherds quarrel,

467
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,630
we have a winning game.

468
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,810
(Ancestral Hall)

469
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:23,910
Hello.

470
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,310
I'd like to ask

471
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,790
about the Yu family and River God Festival.

472
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,830
Why are you drinking alone?

473
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,430
Is something bothering you?

474
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,990
Four years ago,

475
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,310
my child was sacrificed.

476
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,590
Today

477
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,170
is his death anniversary.

478
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,200
Drinking alone

479
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,590
is not helping.

480
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,280
There's a child in the Yu family,

481
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,640
named Yu Caizhe.

482
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Do you know him?

483
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,000
Of course I know.

484
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,590
How did you know?

485
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,710
We saw him inside.

486
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,590
Is he dead?

487
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,400
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

488
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
This child

489
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,070
is more miserable than my kid.

490
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,690
Not long after he was born,

491
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,830
he started having seizures.

492
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,750
He later started taking medicine

493
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,150
and gradually improved by the age of three.

494
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,710
Mrs. Yu was so happy.

495
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,390
It happened to be the River God Festival in town,

496
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,110
with the streets all lit up and decorated.

497
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,720
Mrs. Yu took her child out for a walk.

498
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,520
There was a toy stall on the street,

499
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,150
and Young Master Yu was fascinated

500
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,070
by a kaleidoscope there.

501
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,550
She didn't pay much attention,

502
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,880
and in the blink of an eye,

503
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,190
the child was gone.

504
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,830
Was he abducted?

505
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,120
What happened next?

506
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,490
Well, this is what happened next.

507
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,470
Her son was abducted.

508
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,750
Did Mrs. Yu do anything?

509
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,150
She was deeply concerned about her child,

510
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,280
fell seriously ill,

511
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,300
and was once in a trance.

512
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,350
Later, she gradually recovered.

513
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,030
Every year,

514
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,480
she sponsors the River God Festival,

515
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,590
hoping that

516
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,670
with sincere devotion,

517
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,790
her child will return soon

518
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,750
under the protection of the River God.

519
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,440
So she's just a sponsor?

520
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,720
What's with the sacrificed children?

521
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,389
In order to keep ourselves safe,

522
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,639
we have to sacrifice children.

523
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,750
These children

524
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,190
are all unfortunate.

525
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,929
Being sacrificed to the River God

526
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,070
can also be seen as blessings

527
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,120
for their future lives.

528
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,989
If

529
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,000
the son of the Yu family is still alive,

530
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,570
how old would he be?

531
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,710
Ten years old.

532
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,230
Ten?

533
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,310
So Mrs. Yu is a typical example

534
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,670
of someone who went from being a victim to becoming a perpetrator.

535
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,030
She lost her own child,

536
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,920
so she tried abducting other people's children.

537
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,480
But, there must be a process.

538
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,270
And the process must be painful.

539
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,070
We've found the door.

540
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,630
Mrs. Fu is the Door Ghost.

541
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,070
It seems

542
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,920
the key must have something to do with the missing children.

543
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,310
Is it that easy?

544
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,670
It's already four today,

545
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,760
which means the River God Festival

546
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,160
is only three days away.

547
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,520
If this continues, there will be more and more victims!

548
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,270
Tell me, where are those

549
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,800
sold children exactly?

550
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,320
We can't wait for River God Festival.

551
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,250
Maybe that day will be our last day.

552
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,760
Let's go to Mrs. Fu's place.

553
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,430
Really?

554
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,550
I don't think she's here.

555
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,470
You should stay outside to keep an eye for us,

556
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,470
we'll go in first.

557
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,010
I don't think it's a good idea.

558
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,070
If anything happens,

559
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,610
you can help us, right?

560
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,230
I'll go in first. Follow me.

561
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,630
Be careful.

562
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,630
You can even start a live streaming for e-commerce here.

563
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,670
This...

564
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,590
This must be the kaleidoscope

565
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,690
left behind when Yu Caizhe was abducted.

566
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,230
Lingling.

567
00:37:59,470 --> 00:37:59,990
Lingling.

568
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,990
Yu Lingling.

569
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,230
Yu Lingling!

570
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,790
Yu Lingling, wake up. Wake up!

571
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,350
Cover up your nose and mouth!

572
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,330
You must not get into trouble.

573
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,350
Wh-what happened to me?

574
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,150
It's a hallucinogen.

575
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,610
This one is mandrake, it's hallucinogenic.

576
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,750
I remember now.

577
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,870
Mrs. Fu added this into the lamp oil.

578
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,270
That's why Gu Minglong and I

579
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,030
always sleep deeply and find it hard to wake up.

580
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,670
Nothing happened to you at night,

581
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,730
but just now, you were hallucinated.

582
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,310
Let's go to the backyard.

583
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,770
Don't stay here. Let's go.

584
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,750
Are you okay?

585
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
Strange.

586
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,890
It's not human meat in the pot,

587
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,070
but pork.

588
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,510
Let's keep looking

589
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,390
for any other clues.

590
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,750
There are no children here in Mrs. Fu's place.

591
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,660
Then, where are the four kids

592
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,190
who were sacrificed today?

593
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,530
She has an accomplice.

594
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,750
You just figured it out?

595
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,350
I figured it out a while back.

596
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,750
Oh no. Let's get out of here!

597
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,610
Mrs. Yu is here!

598
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,710
Hurry up.

599
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,990
Go.

600
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,430
Let's go!
