00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,330
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,030
(Episode 38)

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,390
Since his friend designed this game

4
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,670
and he even left the important clue to him,

5
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,940
then the key or the door

6
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,610
must be related to him.

7
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,470
He used to rent a house

8
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,550
with a boy named Wu Qi.

9
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,910
That fast?

10
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,970
Are we the White Snake?

11
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,710
How can we arrive here so fast?

12
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,040
This game is guiding us.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,900
It means I'm right.

14
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,490
The key should be here.

15
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,790
The key?

16
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,280
The Moon in the mirror.

17
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,850
Find the mirror first.

18
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,790
It's like fishing a needle out of the sea.

19
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,270
We're at a loss for what to do

20
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,280
and can't do anything.

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Qianli,

22
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,640
I wanted to ask you just now.

23
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,510
Now you like idioms so much?

24
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,000
You've found it?

25
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,600
Do you feel like I've become

26
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,290
more mature and reliable?

27
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,950
Yes.

28
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,070
Yes my ass.

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,829
You're just a kid.

30
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,470
Don't pretend to be an adult.

31
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,990
Is it so easy

32
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,470
to use a few idioms

33
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,230
for the responsibilities in the adult world?

34
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,750
I don't want to grow up.

35
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,750
I

36
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,079
used to make you worry outside.

37
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,990
I think if there's a chance to see you again,

38
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,150
at least I won't trouble you, right?

39
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,110
If it weren't for Qianli,

40
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,510
we would have been dead.

41
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,150
Don't be too judgmental.

42
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,510
Just relax in this world.

43
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,829
This game

44
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,990
will disappear soon.

45
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,330
It won't be like this anymore.

46
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,350
That's great.

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,110
If the game disappears,

48
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,430
won't you also disappear?

49
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,790
Not only him,

50
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,750
but you will also be gone.

51
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,550
It doesn't matter if I exist or not.

52
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,030
I can't go back anyway.

53
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,030
Ruan can get out.

54
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,470
What if

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,590
he can't get out?

56
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,950
It's okay.

57
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,550
Don't worry about me.

58
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,970
I had no intention of going out

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,200
from the beginning.

60
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,690
Such a stupid game.

61
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,390
It's really harmful.

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,750
We just jump into the pit one after another.

63
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,950
Lingling,

64
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,230
can you design another game

65
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,360
without any taboo conditions,

66
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,270
violence, or death?

67
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,950
We can just get together happily

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,230
and help each other in times of poverty.

69
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,190
That'll be great.

70
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,240
Don't use idioms recklessly anymore.

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Okay.

72
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,350
Who do you want to live with?

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,710
You, him, my brother,

74
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,030
Chen Fei, and Xue.

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,800
It's fine if Yi Manman is there.

76
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh.

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,950
And Zaozao.

78
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,670
She is a superstar after all.

79
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,550
It's better not to have them.

80
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,600
If there is a chance,

81
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,730
I will definitely fulfill your wish.

82
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,909
During this time,

83
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,270
I've been thinking about the relationship between reality and virtuality.

84
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,990
People who disappear in reality

85
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,870
can exist in the virtual world.

86
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,950
And the emotions in the virtual world

87
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,060
are more real than in the real world.

88
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,510
Reality and virtuality seem to be opposite

89
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,160
and complementary.

90
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,200
If we can pass the Spi Realm,

91
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,310
I will do everything I can

92
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,870
to let you exist.

93
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Thank you.

94
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,470
Now that you mention it,

95
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,470
I feel quite good.

96
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,390
It's true.

97
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,030
You know me so well

98
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,070
because you have my big data, right?

99
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,800
If I have more of your data,

100
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,430
I can create you.

101
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,890
It's not difficult to do it

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,070
with the current technology level.

103
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,270
Ruan,

104
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,670
you're scared too.

105
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm much better than you.

106
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,750
I've checked all the mirrors,

107
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,280
but it seems like they can't reflect the moon.

108
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,310
The clue is so important,

109
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,310
so it can't be so silly, right?

110
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,830
Rest enough,

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
let's go.

112
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,470
What time is it?

113
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,350
Oh no.

114
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,470
It's about three o'clock at night.

115
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,560
How did you know?

116
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,030
Before I came in, I took a look at the moon.

117
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,790
Time has been chaotic since we got here,

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
so I rely on the moon's phase.

119
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,270
You can tell time from the moon?

120
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Yes, indeed.

121
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,909
The moon turns perfectly round on the day after mid-autumn day.

122
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,070
On the 17th of the 8th lunar month, the moon is before Geng, on the 18th, the moon is after Geng.

123
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,430
On the 19th and 20th of the 8th lunar month, the moon rises at 9 p.m.

124
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,750
On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of the 8th lunar month the moon rises

125
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,030
at midnight.

126
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,310
On the 24th, 25th, and 26th of the 8th lunar month, the moon appears

127
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,590
for the cattle.

128
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,990
On the 27th, 28th, and 29th of the 8th lunar month,

129
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,390
the moon follows the sun.

130
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,510
Cheng Qianli.

131
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,370
If you keep talking nonsense,

132
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,750
I'll teach you a lesson for your brother.

133
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,160
Well, ancient people used lunar phases

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,290
to determine dates.

135
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,670
But it's more complicated to determine time through lunar phases.

136
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,670
Qianli,

137
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,120
are you suggesting that the moon can represent time?

138
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,390
Yes.

139
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,990
I see.

140
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,230
Since the moon represents time,

141
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,160
the Moon in the mirror is the clock.

142
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,110
I've been ignoring this all along.

143
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,040
The watch in my house ran backward.

144
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,540
Gao Dawei has been designing games abroad,

145
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,240
and he must miss home very much.

146
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,270
The time abroad

147
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,870
is reversed compared to ours,

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,710
so the Moon in the mirror he left behind

149
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,970
has the time reversed.

150
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,430
That backward-running watch is meant to remind me

151
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,230
that it's the Moon in the mirror,

152
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,860
symbolizing both time

153
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,350
and his longing.

154
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,150
Let's go.

155
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,910
Let's go, Qianli.

156
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,950
Lingling,

157
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,830
I'm now

158
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,270
the NPC inside this door.

159
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,360
I can't fight with you anymore.

160
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,580
We will definitely meet.

161
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,310
Keep going.

162
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,950
The key,

163
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
why are there two?

164
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,450
(Illusion of Life) (Reality of Death)

165
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,550
Life?

166
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,990
Death?

167
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,250
The words seem to be about reality and illusion,

168
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,700
not life and death.

169
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,760
(Illusion of Life) (Reality of Death)

170
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,310
Reality and illusion are just adjectives;

171
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,770
life and death are the key.

172
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,070
So many people

173
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,270
can't kill you guys.

174
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,030
They have already been killed by us.

175
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,510
You found the key?

176
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Yes.

177
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,110
The Moon in the mirror is not exactly the moon in the mirror,

178
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,740
it's the time in the mirror.

179
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
Ling Jiushi,

180
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,310
you didn't expect it, did you?

181
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,270
In the game designed for you,

182
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,950
I am the ultimate winner.

183
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,390
If you were the one holding the key and opening the door,

184
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,720
then there would be no winner in this game.

185
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,790
Nonsense.

186
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,250
You've been against me all along.

187
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,640
Now the keys are in my hands.

188
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,910
If I'm not the winner,

189
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,230
then who is?

190
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,030
You've failed.

191
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,190
You've lost.

192
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,730
You seem to be going crazy.

193
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,790
Don't waste time talking to him,

194
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,350
snatch the keys back.

195
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,310
Come over...

196
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,760
If you come closer, I'll swallow the keys.

197
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,810
I could just kill you first

198
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,990
and then dig it out of your belly.

199
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,440
Hold on for a moment.

200
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,830
We haven't found the door yet.

201
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,490
There's only one door to exit,

202
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,920
but we have two keys.

203
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,670
Let's find the door first,

204
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,730
then discuss the keys.

205
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,950
What do you think?

206
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,150
You got it wrong.

207
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm not here to compete with you past the door.

208
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,470
I'm determined to pass it.

209
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,150
I agree.

210
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,550
Why?

211
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
All along,

212
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,600
I never had a choice.

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,970
From entering the door with you

214
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,450
to witnessing your death,

215
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,450
I can only accept and understand.

216
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,830
But this time, Yan Balang will make the choice for me.

217
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,710
If he chooses correctly,

218
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,160
I'll stay here with you.

219
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,530
If he chooses wrongly,

220
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,690
then I'll send you to purify the game.

221
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,030
But if you don't purify the game,

222
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
more people will die.

223
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,090
I don't know those people.

224
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,230
I only know you.

225
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,040
I will only save you.

226
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,630
Since entering the first door,

227
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,870
there's been this question:

228
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,270
save someone I know

229
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,900
or save a group of strangers?

230
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,670
While you all chose to sacrifice the one you know.

231
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,400
I know I should choose this way.

232
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,070
So, I handed over the choice.

233
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,350
This way, whether it's for you

234
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,750
or for other players,

235
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,450
it's relatively fair.

236
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,070
I don't have that much ability.

237
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,400
I just want to save the people I care about.

238
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,030
Save all the people I care about.

239
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,550
So altogether,

240
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,250
I'll save many people.

241
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,990
You said

242
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,110
you would protect me for a lifetime,

243
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,390
whether it's your lifetime

244
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,390
or mine.

245
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,430
Well, I feel the same way.

246
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,350
Thank you.

247
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,710
Now,

248
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,370
I just hope this way

249
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,010
can be a little longer.

250
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,850
(Amazing Supermarket)

251
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Let's go.

252
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,160
(Amazing Internet Cafe)

253
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,790
Don't let them come over.

254
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,870
Your choice will create a sequence.

255
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,540
The choice should be simultaneous.

256
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,990
Opening the door and inserting the key simultaneously.

257
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,510
The one who chooses correctly lives,

258
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,570
while the one who chooses wrong dies.

259
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,540
(Reality of Death)

260
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
(Illusion of Life)

261
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,110
How did you know?

262
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,070
The clue to this door

263
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,910
is, Two leave, one returns."

264
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,880
Isn't that the current situation?

265
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,030
This door's clue isn't unsolvable.

266
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,750
It's not like an applied problem,

267
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,410
so how could it be unsolvable?

268
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,470
Don't you know?

269
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,230
At this time,

270
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,530
what's the point of saying these things?

271
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,310
How could it be meaningless?

272
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,390
Is the purpose of me staying by your side

273
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,190
just to come in and die for you?

274
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,960
Did I painstakingly accompany you until the end

275
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,230
just for money?

276
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,310
I...

277
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,640
You clearly knew the clue to this door,

278
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,650
yet you didn't tell me.

279
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,650
Are you trying to drag me in to be your scapegoat?

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,430
What am I to you in your heart?

281
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,490
Isn't the answer obvious?

282
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,910
If you two go in, only he will survive.

283
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,030
He wanted to use your life

284
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,760
to achieve his own success.

285
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,390
This man

286
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,910
is really bad.

287
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,990
If you two can't decide,

288
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,030
just give us the keys.

289
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,070
No.

290
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,510
No.

291
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,460
(Illusion of Life)

292
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,710
Honey.

293
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,470
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,109
Please help me.

295
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,310
Ah.

296
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,589
I...

297
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,990
I'm so close,

298
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,170
I've put all my efforts into this.

299
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,329
Just this one step, that's all I need.

300
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,640
If I can't replicate this game,

301
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,130
I'll lose everything.

302
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,680
I've already lost everything.

303
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,850
I...

304
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,150
I swear

305
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,280
I didn't mean to hurt you.

306
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,750
But

307
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,790
there's no other way.

308
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,950
Honey.

309
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,510
You know

310
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,870
I can't die now.

311
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,000
I promised those people.

312
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,590
I... I can't die.

313
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,790
I can't die.

314
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,150
Honey! Honey!

315
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,110
Please.

316
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,630
Please help me.

317
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,350
Please, I can't die.

318
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,710
Help me, honey.

319
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,710
Please help me.

320
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,070
I can't die.

321
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,670
I can't die.

322
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,830
If this is your choice,

323
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,910
I'll help you achieve it.

324
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,920
Whether successful or not,

325
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,850
we won't see each other again.

326
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,990
Let's pretend we never met.

327
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,660
(Illusion of Life)(Reality of Death)

328
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,670
If it were me,

329
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
I wouldn't choose it.

330
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,790
Reality and illusion are just adjectives.

331
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,230
Life and death

332
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,150
are the doors of destiny.

333
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,620
(Illusion of Life)(Reality of Death)

334
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,590
Ah!

335
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,880
The Reality of Death

336
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,260
is the way out.

337
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,990
But if I open it,

338
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,930
you'll stay here forever.

339
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,270
If you open it,

340
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,290
you won't be able to purify this game.

341
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,230
But this is a fair choice.

342
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,310
You choose first.

343
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,500
This is definitely not the original design of this game.

344
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Gao Dawei

345
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,920
wouldn't have led you to a dead end.

346
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,070
You said

347
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,090
that this is the original design.

348
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,190
The game may have been heavily modified to the point of

349
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,200
distorting the initial setup,

350
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,470
but the choice is fair enough.

351
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,470
I can accept it.

352
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,510
Life, death.

353
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,310
(Reality of Death)

354
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,240
Life and death have consequences,

355
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,790
so we need to choose between illusion and reality.

356
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,520
Actually, the boundaries aren't that distinct.

357
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,550
I can't choose.

358
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,920
This is a real deadlock.

359
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,800
There's a solution to every applied problem.

360
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,910
What solution?

361
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,350
Even though I joined the X organization for money,

362
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,610
I fell in love with him.

363
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
I also know

364
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,230
he's not worth loving,

365
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,750
but I can't help it.

366
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,690
I've decided not to leave.

367
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,370
I want to stay with him.

368
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,000
Since we have to open two doors at once,

369
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,720
I'll open the door of the Illusion of Life.

370
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,870
You go

371
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,790
and do what you want.

372
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,750
All this time,

373
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,150
we've been at odds, fighting to the death.

374
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,390
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,150
You're the best opponent I've ever encountered.

376
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
(Illusion of Life)(Reality of Death)

377
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,630
Why are all the other doors gone?

378
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,870
There wasn't a chance

379
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,120
to finish the design for the 12th door challenge.

380
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,190
In fact, when players get through 11 door challenges,

381
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,190
they've already finished the game.

382
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,990
So the settings for my character

383
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,030
say that I'm a skilled player who's done 10 door challenges.

384
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,560
Only when I get to this place

385
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,290
can the content of the game be corrected.

386
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,850
What will happen then?

387
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,040
It's hard to explain.

388
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,750
To put it simply,

389
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,690
the rest of this matter

390
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,870
only concerns me.

391
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,750
I don't have a problem understanding all this.

392
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,460
It's just that you aren't making things clear enough.

393
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
I'm not stupid.

394
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,590
12 doors.

395
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,150
12 Sufferings?

396
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,810
Can that many sufferings befall one's life?

397
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,190
Birth, old age, illness, and death.

398
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,350
The pain of parting with a loved one.

399
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,830
The bitterness of not getting what one desires.

400
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,710
The resentment for unpleasant happenings.

401
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,990
Sometimes people are confused and their minds are clouded.

402
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,990
Worries, sorrow, sadness, and anger.

403
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,590
I see it now.

404
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,990
It's what Gao Dawei first had in mind when he designed this game.

405
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,990
12 doors.

406
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,150
12 Chinese zodiac animal signs.

407
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,150
12 months.

408
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,430
12 two-hour periods of a day.

409
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
12...

410
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,630
It's a number representing the endless circle of life.

411
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,630
12 Sufferings

412
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,530
correspond to 12 negative emotions.

413
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,230
Players do door challenges that stand for different emotions.

414
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,160
When they solve all 12 challenges,

415
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,390
it means

416
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,690
they've overcome 12 negative emotions.

417
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then

418
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,110
they'll feel like they've been reborn.

419
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,010
The term "reborn" here

420
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,960
doesn't refer to biological changes.

421
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,010
It's only about a person's state of mind.

422
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,470
It seems like you've suddenly become talkative.

423
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,110
I'm busted.

424
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,830
I was thinking

425
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,440
that if our chat continued,

426
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,370
you could stay longer. Right?

427
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,830
However,

428
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,720
there's an end to every conversation.

429
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,480
Parting is inevitable.

430
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,250
The days we've spent together

431
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,080
have brought me so much joy.

432
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,590
I'm grateful.

433
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,350

He's moving!

469
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,960
He seems to be awake now.

470
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,510
He went across the road when the red light for pedestrians was still on.

471
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,840
I was driving as normal.

472
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,550
Xiong Qi?

473
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,710
Did you just knock an acquaintance down with your car?

474
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,770
Who do you mean? Do we know each other?

475
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,790
I don't know him at all!

476
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,110
Don't you try to blackmail me!

477
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,110
Xiong Qi...

478
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,790
Please let us get through.

479
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,990
Excuse me.

480
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,290
Bring the stretcher here.

481
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,790
You finally woke up.

482
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,910
I was worried sick.

483
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,910
Doctor! Doctor! He is awake.

484
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,390
Look at this.

485
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,840
Everything's fine.

486
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,790
Thanks to your good physical condition,

487
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,390
you're recovering quickly.

488
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,390
Chen Fei,

489
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,570
why are you working in this hospital?

490
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
Do you know me?

491
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,830
Dr. Chen has been working here all the time.

492
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,670
Aren't you

493
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,550
a vet?

494
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,350
Dr. Chen, have you been a vet?

495
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,870
Contact the department of neurology.

496
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,870
Arrange a consultation in the afternoon.

497
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,870
Okay.

498
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Have a good rest.

499
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,360
I'll lift your bed up, alright?

500
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,550
Is it okay?

501
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,330
You just woke up from a five-day coma.

502
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,510
Are you feeling alright?

503
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,510
Are you hungry?

504
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,110
Shall I buy you some food?

505
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,950
The Spi Realm...

506
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,590
How is this game now?

507
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,150
How did you get to know about this newly launched game

508
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,350
called the Spi Realm?

509
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,190
Has the car accident turned you into a psychic?

510
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,950
The game has gained much popularity.

511
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,470
Let me show you.

512
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,470
No.

513
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,830
Don't get it started.

514
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,190
It's too dangerous.

515
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,990
What's dangerous about it?

516
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,150
Look.

517
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,820
(Click to start)

518
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
(Friends on an adventure)

519
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,950
It's a great stress reliever.

520
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,910
No. This is not what I'm saying.

521
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,630
I mean a game about door challenges

522
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,310
that combines virtual reality and real life.

523
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,910
Well, players open a door and take a challenge.

524
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,710
Has that car accident done something to your brain?

525
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,070
I've never heard of such a game.

526
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,510
No. I've helped you solve a door challenge,

527
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,590
where Li Dongyuan died.

528
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,320
Do you remember?

529
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,710
Who is Li Dongyuan?

530
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,740
What are you talking about?

531
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,750
Previously,

532
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,430
I received a hard disk,

533
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,670
in which this game was found.

534
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,990
Then I moved to a new house

535
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,280
and joined an organization called Obsidian.

536
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,450
You've been to that house several times to visit me.

537
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,280
The leader of the organization

538
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,030
is named Ruan Lanzhu.

539
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,310
Did you have a ridiculous dream

540
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,950
when you were in a coma?

541
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Jiushi,

542
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,850
you had a car accident,

543
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,470
and have been unconscious until today.

544
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,930
What's all that "obsidian" stuff about?

545
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,390
A car accident?

546
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,510
Are you saying

547
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,590
that I went out on that day and had a car accident?

548
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,190
Yes.

549
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,310
See for yourself.

550
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,110
It's only been five days since the accident, right?

551
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,110
It's impossible.

552
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,880
This is impossible!

553
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,110
Calm down.

554
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,350
You've been severely injured.

555
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,909
It can be a cause of

556
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,670
memory disorders.

557
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,040
I'll talk to the doctor,

558
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,520
and see if he can move up the consultation.

559
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,250
I'll be right back.

560
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
It can't be true.

561
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,070
It just can't be true!

562
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,750
Move slowly.

563
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,490
Here, your cellphone.

564
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,410
It was broken in the accident.

565
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,760
Then I fixed it for you

566
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,020
and restored the data.

567
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,700
(Contacts)

568
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,190
Where is Zaozao?

569
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,510
Who?

570
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,670
That actress named Tan Zaozao.

571
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,200
What kind of actress

572
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,190
would have such a terrible name?

573
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,710
My girlfriend knows about tons of celebrities,

574
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,640
but she's never talked about someone called Zaozao.

575
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,070
The number you dialed does not exist.

576
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,710
Please check it before you dial again.

577
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,710
Are you okay?

578
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm fine.

579
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,710
I'd like to go out for a walk.

580
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,230
Then give me a moment so I can ask for a leave from work.

581
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,350
Let me keep you company, alright?

582
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,350
No need.

583
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,530
Just take care of Chestnut for me.

584
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,640
Who are you looking for?

585
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,070
Is there an organization called Obsidian?

586
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,590
Obsidian?

587
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,150
I've been living here for a long time,

588
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,950
yet I've never heard of this organization.

589
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,480
You came to the wrong place.

590
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,550
Well,

591
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,270
I have one more question.

592
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,150
Is there a man named Ruan Lanzhu?

593
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,750
Ruan Lanzhu?

594
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,690
It doesn't ring a bell with me.

595
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,610
Why's everything so familiar?

596
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,510
Am I in the game or out of it?

597
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,430
Hello!

598
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,190
What's up?

599
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,570
How's it going with the Spi Realm?

600
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,390
The Spi Realm?

601
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,140
Is that a game?

602
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,330
What else can it be?

603
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,870
How come I don't remember it?

604
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,790
I played it here not long ago.

605
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,750
I'm talking about the game

606
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,750
whose beta version starts

607
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,890
with a fight against huge wolves.

608
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,030
Oh, that one!

609
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,830
People often offer

610
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,780
to install free beta games on my computers here

611
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,590
in order to collect feedback from players.

612
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,950
The game you're talking about is so cheesy.

613
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,030
The reviews about it aren't very good.

614
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,290
Even the game designer has given up on it.

615
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,310
Is the designer's surname Gao?

616
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,670
No.

617
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,590
He's a college student in America.

618
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,750
He hasn't graduated yet.

619
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,350
The game is supposed to be his graduation project.

620
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,150
But I doubt if it's a wise choice.

621
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,830
Sir, do you have new games here?

622
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,590
I want something exciting.

623
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,510
I've got tons of new games.

624
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,190
Pick whichever one you want.

625
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,800
Can't you stop playing games like this?

626
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,750
It's so scary that I cried last time.

627
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,010
Why don't you play puzzle games instead?

628
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,310
Yixie? Qianli?

629
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,510
What are the odds of seeing you here?

630
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,910
Don't talk nonsense.

631
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,430
I'm trying to win this round here.

632
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,430
Don't disturb me.

633
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,950
We...

634
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,700
I've been looking for you for a long time.

635
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,190
Do we know each other?

636
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,190
Of course, we do!

637
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,350
Didn't we used to be members of Obsidian,

638
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,010
and fellow door challengers?

639
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,390
Obsidian...

640
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,150
What is he talking about?

641
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,960
I don't know. I have no idea.

642
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,030
You don't know me?

643
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,270
Well, don't get

644
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,120
too obsessed with computer games.

645
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,590
He seems like a young man.

646
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,520
How come he's such a nag?

647
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,520
He actually looks a bit familiar to me.

648
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,750
Do you know him or not?

649
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,470
No.

650
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,060
Zhang Mingyu?

651
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,230
It's really you!

652
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,950
I spotted you from a distance.

653
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,790
Did you

654
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,180
go abroad?

655
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,190
Ah!

656
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,350
How did you know that?

657
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,480
I've just returned.

658
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,190
Have you got any news about Gao Dawei?

659
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,250
He's in Europe now.

660
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,190
Recently, he's been working on a big project.

661
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,120
I don't think he'll come back soon.

662
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,150
Do you know

663
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,770
that he's been developing a game lately?

664
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,790
A game?

665
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,390
He studied economics abroad.

666
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,350
Why would he develop games?

667
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,590
Economics?

668
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,710
Maybe

669
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,750
I'm mistaken.

670
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,990
I'm mistaken.

671
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,190
Honey, what are you doing?

672
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,790
I'm starving.

673
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,510
Come back now!

674
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,170
Sure. Sure.

675
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,850
I need to go. Talk to you later!

676
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,750
Bye!

677
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,160
Let me think about what day it is, alright?

678
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,190
I'm gonna...

679
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,910
Thank you so much for the "hot balloon" tip!

680
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,550
You guys are the best!

681
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm on the list of the top ten streamers now!

682
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,430
Ms. Nannan, long time no see!

683
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,870
Guys, today you're amazing!

684
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,470
Okay. I'll take these two.

685
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,930
Maybe I'll pick a few more.

686
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,240
This one looks good too.

687
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,810
Does it also cost 10 bucks?

688
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,190
Hello, Mr. Wang.

689
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,750
I'm not in the office now.

690
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,880
Do you need my help with something?

691
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,750
Can I hand in that file tomorrow?

692
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll see you tomorrow then.

693
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,790
Sir, want a new cellphone screen protector?

694
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,270
Put one on my cellphone first.

695
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,990
I'm in a hurry. I need to go to work.

696
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,830
Alright. Chill out. I'll do it now.

697
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,830
Be quick!

698
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,920
What are you doing here?

699
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,190
I've been looking everywhere for you.

700
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,590
Why wouldn't you go home?

701
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm thinking about moving out.

702
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,190
You should live there with your girlfriend.

703
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,190
Why?

704
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,110
I want my own place.

705
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,150
You're trying to bury your head in the sand again, aren't you?

706
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,750
You always complain about not being discovered, even though you're talented.

707
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,270
What you're doing now will only make you feel more isolated.

708
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,070
Do not bury your head in the sand.

709
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,650
That's not what I'm doing.

710
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,190
I'm on a quest.

711
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,750
A quest for what?

712
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,710
The combination of virtual reality and real life.

713
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,710
What is that now?

714
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,830
The Spi Realm.

715
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,130
(50 years later)

716
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,190
Why are you still a rookie?

717
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,540
Do you have any problems?

718
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:13,630
If you have, let's have another round.

719
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,310
What problem?

720
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,230
Look at you. You're old.

721
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,630
And you're sitting in a wheelchair.

722
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,870
Take care of yourself.

723
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,360
Rookie.

724
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,230
Digital Technology

725
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,230
is more advanced than humans think.

726
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,950
It has been iterated so many times

727
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,910
since 5G was created 30 years ago.

728
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,910
But for me,

729
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,410
what I want is still the Spi Realm,

730
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,960
which is virtual reality technology.

731
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,960
Someone called it, the virtual reality,

732
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,230
metaverse 30 years ago.

733
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,190
But actually,

734
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,110
Qian Xuesen explained the principle

735
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,550
of virtual reality technology 60 years ago.

736
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,950
And he called this technology and research

737
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,310
the Spi Realm.

738
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,030
Wu Qi.

739
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,920
I finally made it.

740
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,950
Do you want to take a look?

741
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,550
Well.

742
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,670
No. What should I look at?

743
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,280
I'm taking care of my grandson.

744
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,290
I believe in virtual reality technology.

745
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,210
And I believe that there will be a world of the Spi Realm.

746
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,430
Everything inside

747
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,790
is virtual, based on reality.

748
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,360
And the reality can be virtualized again.

749
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,310
As long as we have enough data

750
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,640
to simulate and generate this system,

751
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,830
maybe it will have its own consciousness

752
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,350
and form a different worldview.

753
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,750
Including

754
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,000
the 12th door.

755
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,030
Coming.

756
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,790
Lingling.

757
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,790
Come in.

758
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,710
Manman, Lingling is back.

759
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,710
You are back.

760
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,750
Not funny.

761
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,290
What do you want to eat?

762
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,590
Jiushi.

763
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,760
Stay for dinner.

764
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,630
I'll cook your favorite dishes.

765
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,710
Hurry up. You can't catch up with me.

766
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,750
You should hurry up.

767
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,230
Why are you so bad at this?

768
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,830
You rookie.

769
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,110
Who is the rookie?

770
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,110
You.

771
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,510
I'm dying.

772
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
Lingling,

773
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,910
you're finally back.

774
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,110
I feel like

775
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,070
I had a long dream.

776
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,630
Well.

777
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,310
Playing a game is like

778
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,190
having a dream.

779
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,190
Long time no see.

780
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,070
Not long.

781
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,590
I'm glad you're back.

782
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
Welcome to

783
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,570
the world of the Spi Realm.

784
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,960
♫Thinking of the first time we met♫

785
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:09,650
♫We were still young♫

786
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,970
♫Too many memories are like movies♫

787
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,620
♫It makes me sink into the night breeze♫

788
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,840
♫If I could go back to that day♫

789
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,210
♫I don't want to have any change♫

790
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,230
♫I don't want you to laugh at me for being too serious♫

791
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,600
♫I don't know what to do in the story♫

792
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,980
♫If fate had no plan♫

793
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,210
♫I didn't enter this door♫

794
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,330
♫This story will be wonderful♫

795
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,480
♫And disappear from the world♫

796
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,730
♫One accident and another accident♫

797
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,150
♫Connect us♫

798
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:14,120
♫I can find another one if I miss you♫

799
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,450
♫I'll just be one person lost in the crowd♫

800
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,750
♫Sincerity is all I have♫

801
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,940
♫Just out of nowhere♫

802
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,200
♫We've been passing the seasons♫

803
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,580
♫One accident and another accident♫

804
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,700
♫Connect us♫

805
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,250
♫Hold on to it tightly♫

806
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,300
♫This fate♫

807
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,660
♫If I could go back to that day♫

808
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:54,130
♫I don't want to have any change♫

809
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:01,180
♫I don't want you to laugh at me for being too serious♫

810
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,420
♫I don't know what to do in the story♫

811
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,780
♫If fate had no plan♫

812
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,000
♫I didn't enter this door♫

♫My love♫
