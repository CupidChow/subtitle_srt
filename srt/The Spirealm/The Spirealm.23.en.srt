1
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,400
(Killing Game)

2
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,039
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,110
I didn't expect Xiong Qi to be such a bumbler

4
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,370
and fail so easily.

5
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,320
Those three from Obsidian are a bit troublesome.

6
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,570
They live in the same room.

7
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,050
I wonder if the frame is powerful enough.

8
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,720
If I had known it would be so difficult,

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,880
I should have asked Xia for more money.

10
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,190
Note, my note.

11
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,710
Where is my note?

12
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,829
(Wish you safe)

13
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,030
Where is my note?

14
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,430
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,310
Help! Is anyone there?

16
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,820
Help me!

17
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,810
As expected, another one is missing.

18
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,750
Why isn't Yang Meishu here?

19
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
I don't know.

20
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,070
I knocked on her door,

21
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,190
but she didn't answer.

22
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,950
Maybe she hasn't woken up.

23
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,190
Let's go.

24
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,670
Did she turn into this painting?

25
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,510
Even the painting

26
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,170
doesn't look good.

27
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,830
You did it?

28
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,490
I just told them where the frame is.

29
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,550
You stand on the bridge to view the scenery,

30
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,070
and people who view the scenery look at you upstairs.

31
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,070
The moon decorated your window,

32
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,570
and you decorated someone else's dream.

33
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,870
This is...

34
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,630
Is this a clue?

35
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,990
You did it, Xiong?

36
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,630
I always respect women.

37
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,710
It was me.

38
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,550
I just returned her things to her.

39
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,920
Where did you put the frame?

40
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,390
That works?

41
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,390
I also want to know if it works.

42
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,110
I didn't expect it to work.

43
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,590
Last night,

44
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,570
I entered the painting in our room

45
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,070
and came out of the painting in Yang Meishu's room.

46
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,990
She was having a sweet dream.

47
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,590
So I changed her note.

48
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,710
What is this?

49
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,070
It's a mess.

50
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,590
There's red.

51
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,630
Probably blood.

52
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,990
We could see the faces of people

53
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,470
in the painting before.

54
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,790
Now it's like this.

55
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,710
I don't know what she did.

56
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,510
The painting is in the room.

57
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,510
It means

58
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,909
she hasn't left here.

59
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,320
She must have violated the taboo conditions.

60
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,530
She attacked the lady in the rain.

61
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,990
The one who harmed others died first.

62
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,390
What does that mean?

63
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,420
We've been looking at it all night

64
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,990
and didn't figure it out.

65
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
We are the scenery.

66
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,230
The one viewing the scenery

67
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,230
is the Madam.

68
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,870
Yang Meishu has more clues

69
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,190
than us.

70
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,310
She probably got these from

71
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,530
the other players.

72
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,800
That's what I'm saying.

73
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,610
Cheating isn't scary.

74
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,550
What's scary is cheating to harm.

75
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,540
Anyway, the bad guy is dead.

76
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,530
We know the taboo conditions.

77
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,590
We can relax now.

78
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Yeah.

79
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,690
Since we know where the key is,

80
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,990
let's go find the door.

81
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,990
Okay.

82
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,350
You stand on the bridge to view the scenery,

83
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,830
and people who view the scenery look at you upstairs.

84
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,630
The moon decorated your window,

85
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,510
and you decorated someone else's dream.

86
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,790
What should we do next?

87
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,890
We stand in the castle to view the paintings,

88
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,110
and people who view the paintings look at us upstairs.

89
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,990
The frame decorated our window,

90
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,070
and we decorated someone else's dream.

91
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,770
It's clearly written on the note.

92
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,190
Just not sure if the "dream"

93
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,560
refers to the Madam bringing us into the painting

94
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,180
or something else.

95
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,510
I think

96
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,190
the "dream"

97
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,180
refers to the painting upstairs.

98
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,990
You mean the Twelve Sufferings?

99
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,990
Yes.

100
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,240
It makes me uncomfortable.

101
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,390
Let's burn it.

102
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,930
Aren't you afraid?

103
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,070
Yes.

104
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,800
But we can't just watch and wait

105
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,240
for her to finish it.

106
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Okay.

107
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,950
Let's go to the room

108
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,920
where she keeps unfinished works.

109
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,230
The Twelve Sufferings

110
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,190
won't be finished anytime soon.

111
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,190
Okay.

112
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,990
Are these paintings newly painted?

113
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,470
All the blank spaces on the paintings

114
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,600
have been filled in.

115
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,530
She's quite prolific.

116
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,510
I'd rather she ran out of talent.

117
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's keep looking.

118
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,430
The door should be in one of the paintings.

119
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,690
With so many paintings

120
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,500
covering every corner of the castle,

121
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,710
there must be a clue.

122
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,910
I found it.

123
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,470
Lingling.

124
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,250
You're really observant.

125
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,150
It's the staircase of the castle.

126
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
Go take a look.

127
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,590
This is it.

128
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,910
Found the door.

129
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,840
No wonder you've passed ten doors.

130
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,250
Let's go

131
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,920
find Xiong Qi and Ke.

132
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,720
Alright, stop arguing.

133
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,610
Let me enter the painting.

134
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,150
I'll distract the Madam.

135
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,150
But I can only buy you five minutes.

136
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,000
That's your time limit.

137
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,000
You must leave that room

138
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,470
within five minutes.

139
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Who's going in?

140
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
I'll go.

141
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,070
Kid,

142
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,080
it's a life-or-death situation in there.

143
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,140
Aren't you afraid?

144
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,150
Yes.

145
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,710
But I have to go.

146
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,430
Fine.

147
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,070
You are so calm.

148
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,940
Since I met you when passing the first door,

149
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,240
I felt you were different from the others,

150
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,550
like you were born for this game.

151
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,090
Leave emotions aside.

152
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,860
Whose note is outside the door?

153
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,830
It's yours.

154
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,930
It's all yours from now on.

155
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,030
Now I'm entering the door

156
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,730
not for the prize money

157
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,190
or to clear the stage.

158
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,720
I just want to find a way,

159
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,070
find a way

160
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,070
to get Ke out of the door.

161
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,830
Okay.

162
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,040
Let's go back first.

163
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,560
If there's a chance,

164
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,200
we'll get Ke back together.

165
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,440
You should let me leave this world.

166
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,910
Me appearing in the game

167
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,440
is equivalent to cheating.

168
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,710
If you get caught,

169
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,520
you will be punished severely.

170
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,930
As long as you're here with me,

171
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,930
I'm not afraid of any punishment.

172
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,050
What are you doing?

173
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,310
You can use it as a mirror?

174
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,110
The guy who sells props said

175
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,030
it's just a mirror.

176
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,030
Let me take a look.

177
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,990
What's wrong?

178
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,990
I think I saw a moon.

179
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Nothing.

180
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,750
How could there be a moon in the day?

181
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,680
Maybe I saw it wrong.

182
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,710
He can be polite all the time.

183
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,750
Two minutes left.

184
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,780
At 10:40, Ke will enter the painting.

185
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,750
You must come out at 10:45.

186
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,350
I saw

187
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,910
the key in the frame in the room.

188
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,910
It's easy to find.

189
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,100
If it doesn't work, just give up.

190
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,910
You must come out.

191
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,910
Water.

192
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,030
Water.

193
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,670
Water.

194
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
You're awake.

195
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,230
Yixie.

196
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,870
I'm Qianli.

197
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,590
How long have we known each other?

198
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,990
How could you mistake me?

199
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,550
I'm not dead?

200
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,790
Yeah.

201
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,830
But Mr. Ruan almost died.

202
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,830
What happened to him?

203
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,120
He's fine. His life is no longer in danger.

204
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,950
With Chen Fei's ability,

205
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,910
as long as he doesn't die directly,

206
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,110
he'll be fine soon.

207
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,310
How could he get into trouble?

208
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,670
Before I came out,

209
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,030
I clearly threw him the key.

210
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,580
I don't know the details.

211
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,910
He's still unconscious.

212
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,610
How long have I been unconscious?

213
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,910
Two days.

214
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,230
Two days?

215
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,180
What happened after that?

216
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,590
How did I get out?

217
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,030
It is said

218
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,500
that Ruan rushed in and saved you.

219
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,770
He entered the door again?

220
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,150
But Madam

221
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,080
was guarding the door, wasn't she?

222
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,750
It's a long story.

223
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,590
I heard...

224
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,270
It's just hearsay.

225
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,470
Can he come back?

226
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,470
Ke is coming out.

227
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,430
Five minutes is her limit.

228
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,310
Don't push yourself.

229
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,150
Did you get the key?

230
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,030
I'm going to save him.

231
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,950
But Madam has come back.

232
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,310
Let me enter the door again.

233
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,750
No.

234
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,090
It's dangerous. You're injured.

235
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,230
Every door is dangerous.

236
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,830
I'm offline now.

237
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,270
I'll die if I go out.

238
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,550
I'm content

239
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,320
just to be here with you.

240
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,990
I played this game

241
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,950
because I was lonely.

242
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,750
But

243
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,390
I met you.

244
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,520
I'm not lonely anymore.

245
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,350
Then,

246
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,110
we met Ling Jiushi,

247
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,110
a kind and righteous man, as you said.

248
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,630
Xiong,

249
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,210
I'm willing to take another risk.

250
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,310
Thank you, Ke.

251
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,990
Let's go.

252
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,630
Ke was the only one who could bring others into the painting.

253
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,790
To save you,

254
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,190
she took Ruan into the painting again.

255
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,950
Ruan was severely injured to protect you.

256
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Take him away.

257
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,050
Go to the iron door.

258
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,670
You're badly injured.

259
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,830
What about taking a rest first?

260
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,960
Take Lingling away.

261
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,230
Go. Go.

262
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,230
Let's go.

263
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,190
Madam!

264
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
Hurry.

265
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,070
What's wrong?

266
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,030
Madam is catching up.

267
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,310
Go back to the studio.

268
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,230
Over there.

269
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,550
Stop!

270
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,730
If you take a step forward,

271
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,950
you'll

272
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,630
never see this again.

273
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,950
Put it down.

274
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,110
What you treasure

275
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,950
is a killing tool.

276
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,390
It is a dedication to art.

277
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,160
Being part of a painting

278
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,710
enables them to be a part of eternity.

279
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,670
This is the only way for me

280
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,070
to draw masterpieces.

281
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,790
With them,

282
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,230
these paintings got souls.

283
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,390
Back then,

284
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,990
Huang Mingyuan utilized your feelings for him

285
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,510
and copied your work.

286
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,030
After you found it out,

287
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,390
you guys had a big fight.

288
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,470
Then,

289
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,430
he abandoned you.

290
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,190
For so many years,

291
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,230
you have kept the bottle of red paint.

292
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,270
It shows

293
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,080
that you loved him very much back then.

294
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,670
That resulted in your deep resentment.

295
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,070
However, you vented your resentment

296
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,870
on players.

297
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,550
It's all because of him,

298
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,310
Huang Mingyuan...

299
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,670
No.

300
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,200
It has nothing to do with him.

301
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,880
Listen,

302
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,950
without me, you're a nobody.

303
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,750
Why didn't my name appear in the newspaper?

304
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,590
Enough!

305
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,590
Don't leave! Don't leave me alone!

306
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,590
Humph.

307
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,630
He lied to you

308
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,650
and took advantage of your feelings.

309
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,690
But art is not a tool to vent your resentment.

310
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,680
Look at your paintings.

311
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,310
If you use your understanding of art

312
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,950
to enlighten others,

313
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,310
they will be legendary works.

314
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,270
Enlighten others?

315
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,550
Yes.

316
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,630
Not to hurt others.

317
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
You know nothing.

318
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,830
Art needs trauma.

319
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,550
Look at yourself.

320
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,520
You were pretty before.

321
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,590
We both are women.

322
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,050
I know how you feel.

323
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,890
Many women have been hurt by love.

324
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,350
We are easy to be bullied

325
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,450
and mentally controlled.

326
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,240
I've acted many eye candy roles.

327
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,990
None of these characters are divorced.

328
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,430
I envy you.

329
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,910
You're going the wrong way,

330
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,090
but you've been looking for a way out.

331
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,030
Is improper behavior also worth

332
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,550
to be envied?

333
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,670
Of course.

334
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,190
One day, you'll get the solution.

335
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,360
The Twelve Sufferings you drew

336
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,190
is dreary.

337
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
I don't like it.

338
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,040
I like this one the best.

339
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,470
Art

340
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,430
and insights

341
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,840
don't matter at all.

342
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,250
What really matters is

343
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,310
your choice.

344
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,030
Be yourself.

345
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,160
I allow you to leave.

346
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,230
I'm going to draw a new self-portrait.

347
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,870
Here.

348
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,390
Zhu.

349
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,740
Come on.

350
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
Here.

351
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
Take care.

352
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Take care.

353
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,510
Xiong,

354
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,960
see you in the next door.

355
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,910
Is anyone there?

356
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,910
Chen Fei!

357
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,670
What's wrong?

358
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,400
Go upstairs.

359
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,670
Go upstairs.

360
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,350
Ruan.

361
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,230
Lingling.

362
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,310
Yixie, come out and help.

363
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,950
I've never seen Ruan risk his life for anyone.

364
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,310
He kept telling us

365
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,390
that if we wanted to live in the game,

366
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,450
we couldn't put ourselves in danger.

367
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,670
But

368
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,440
he risked his life for you.

369
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,070
But at the last moment,

370
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,310
you risked your life

371
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,510
and threw the key out.

372
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,120
You are the same as Ruan.

373
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,310
You two

374
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,750
are the best partners.

375
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,110
Come in.

376
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Lanzhu,

377
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,990
thank you.

378
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,880
What will you do to thank me?

379
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,440
What do you want me to do?

380
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,890
I haven't decided yet.

381
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,510
Have a rest.

382
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,360
You can think over it

383
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,510
after recovery.

384
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,430
Don't leave.

385
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
Stay with me a little longer.

386
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,190
Okay.

387
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,600
Does your wound still hurt?

388
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,510
A little.

389
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,190
Ruan, the superstar came to visit you.

390
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,990
Ruan.

391
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,910
How do you do?

392
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,470
I'm fine.

393
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,270
Do you want some fruit?

394
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,070
There are mangoes, pears, litchis, bananas,

395
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,470
pineapple, and other fruit.

396
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,470
No, thanks.

397
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,590
No?

398
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,830
No.

399
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,630
Qianli,

400
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,110
pick out litchis

401
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,470
for Ruan.

402
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,670
A beauty should eat litchis.

403
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,910
Tan Zaozao,

404
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,510
do you think now I'm too weak now

405
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,230
to teach you a lesson?

406
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,270
Lingling, calm Ruan down.

407
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,330
He wants to beat me.

408
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,150
What tool do you want to use?

409
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,470
The fruit knife?

410
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,550
You guys!

411
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,830
Zaozao,

412
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,910
your next door is open.

413
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,070
Be careful.

414
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,670
Are you ready?

415
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,470
I think it's all right.

416
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,070
I'm not sure yet.

417
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,110
By the way, Lingling,

418
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,190
do you like any celebrities?

419
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,410
No, I am not a fan of any celebrity.

420
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,350
What a pity.

421
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,670
Otherwise, I can get their autographs for you

422
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,150
and tell you

423
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,320
some surprising scandals about them.

424
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,850
For example, this one.

425
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,080
(Breaking news: A celebrity got into an accident on her way to a concert.)

426
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,130
(A significant car accident caused 3 casualties.)

427
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,310
She...

428
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,750
What's wrong?

429
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,640
She was also an actress.

430
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,330
I think she was also a game player.

431
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,470
We modeled for commercials together.

432
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,400
But we didn't know each other well.

433
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,870
She had an accident once.

434
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,430
When she went out for dinner,

435
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,440
a car suddenly went out of control and came at her.

436
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,570
But she suffered only minor injuries.

437
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,310
She had some accidents after that.

438
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,650
I was suspicious at that time.

439
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,310
But why

440
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,880
did she die all of a sudden?

441
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,670
Maybe it was just an accident.

442
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,110
Maybe it was not caused by the doors.

443
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,970
I think it was caused by the doors.

444
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,830
I'm leaving.

445
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,510
Have a good rest.

446
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,310
Is she okay?

447
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,310
I don't think she's fine.

448
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,790
But we can do nothing.

449
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,550
She chose

450
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,920
the road herself.

451
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,710
Here are litchis.

452
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,590
Have one.

453
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,230
Is it delicious?

454
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,470
Yes.

455
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,090
Spit the stone out.

456
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,320
What are you looking at?

457
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,790
Now I got

458
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,590
what Zaozao said.

459
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,510
What?

460
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,060
A beauty should eat litchis.

461
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,920
Cheng Qianli.

462
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm leaving. You guys talk.

463
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,710
Don't move.

464
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,750
Let me do it.

465
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,910
What's wrong?

466
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,950
How did you get the scar on your back?

467
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,150
I got hurt before.

468
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:13,429
The scar didn't fade even after I recovered.

469
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,389
I have a scar on my back, too.

470
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,510
It's exactly like yours.

471
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,440
What a coincidence.

472
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,790
Is it a coincidence?

473
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,429
In the Obsidian,

474
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,190
aside from you,

475
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,710
Yexie's the highest-ranking door-passing shepherd.

476
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,710
He is so young.

477
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,960
He must have played this game long ago.

478
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,350
Kids are very curious.

479
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,190
They want to try anything new,

480
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,750
no matter if it's risky or not.

481
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
Is it Ruan?

482
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,430
And Ling Jiushi?

483
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,710
How did you know we were here?

484
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,310
I could smell you.

485
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,710
In this garden,

486
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,630
all kinds of flavors are mixed,

487
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,690
you could smell us?

488
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,560
He has a good sense of smell,

489
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,120
just like your hearing.

490
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,210
Why are you drinking here?

491
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,310
Are you nervous

492
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,210
as you're going to enter the door?

493
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,890
I want to think over

494
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,870
something.

495
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,510
Something about Qianli?

496
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
Ruan,

497
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,210
if something happens to me

498
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,590
in the doors,

499
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,950
I hope you can take care of Qianli for me.

500
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,190
Nonsense.

501
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,290
Stop drinking.

502
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,490
Have some candies.

503
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,230
Boss, what's wrong?

504
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,030
White Deer also refused our invitation.

505
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,470
Where is Xiong Qi?

506
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,360
Didn't he come out?

507
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,590
He's gone.

508
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,510
Gone?

509
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,790
What do you mean?

510
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,990
Well, just gone.

511
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,820
Should I send someone to look for him?

512
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,630
Boss, what's wrong?

513
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Are you okay?

514
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,670
Tell us what bothers you,

515
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:20,990
we can...

516
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,550
Don't worry about that.

517
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,550
Since Obsidian,

518
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,190
White Deer,

519
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,350
and White Bear

520
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,590
all refused me.

521
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,350
I'll teach them a lesson.

522
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,400
Don't let them form an alliance

523
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,590
and ruin my plan.

524
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,240
The time Mr. Danny set is almost up.

525
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,150
I might run away

526
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,210
if I fail to get the investment from America.

527
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,550
I trust you the most.

528
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,960
You know what I mean, right?

529
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,010
I've asked Yan Shihe for help.

530
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,870
Yan Shihe is cunning.

531
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,070
He is scarier than me.

532
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,590
Don't be soft.

533
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,950
Only pain

534
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,830
can make them know their place.

535
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Don't worry.

536
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,070
This time,

537
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,510
I promise I'll make it.
