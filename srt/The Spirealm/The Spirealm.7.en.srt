(THE SPIREALM)

3
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,970
(Episode 7)

4
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,870
At that time,

5
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,509
I was concentrating on the time machine.

6
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,070
But I haven't figured it out yet.

7
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,830
I never conducted experiments on humans.

8
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,670
He came to me that day.

9
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
Do me a favor.

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,990
Do me a favor and send me back.

11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,900
Your house is right across the street.

12
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,150
I'll take you back home.

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,470
I know what that is.

14
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,750
Send me back.

15
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,350
I want to go back to August 25, 2010.

16
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,230
Send me back!

17
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,590
It's a bit complicated.

18
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,470
Wait!

19
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,350
I've never experimented on a living person.

20
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,830
I'm not lying. It's not stable yet.

21
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,830
Send me back.

22
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,190
Are you sure?

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,420
Then I'll do it.

24
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,450
You've sort of devoted yourself to science.

25
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,990
On behalf of this project,

26
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,360
thank you.

27
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,230
- Are you sure? - Yes!

28
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Really?

29
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,990
I knew I'd missed a part.

30
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,910
Why can't it be suspended?

31
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,950
Since then,

32
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,450
I've never seen him again.

33
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,750
This is

34
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,470
the general situation.

35
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,269
He originally intended to

36
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,709
go back to the year 2010.

37
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,190
But

38
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,070
I've figured it out now.

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,510
It can send you back

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,750
to any time you want.

41
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,590
Who wants to go back?

42
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,910
No problem.

43
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,990
Don't worry. You can all go back.

44
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,360
He really travel through time?

45
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,590
You can come into this game.

46
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,310
Why can't he travel through time?

47
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,570
Then why did he want to go back to the past?

48
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,790
I know.

49
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,590
He wanted to go back to August 25, 2010,

50
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,380
to prevent the accident

51
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,510
and save his mother.

52
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,480
But what's the connection?

53
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,110
He wasn't born

54
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,470
in 1985.

55
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,790
Why did the time machine

56
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,000
send him back to 1985?

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,730
But his mother was born in 1985.

58
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,270
Maybe one of the triplets

59
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,270
was his mother.

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,310
That's why the triplets kept asking us

61
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,510
if we knew them.

62
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,600
This door may seem simple,

63
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,690
but it traps us with common sense.

64
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,210
This is also a hint from this door.

65
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,480
You guys really came at the right time.

66
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,750
Zhu Meng,

67
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,550
don't be sarcastic.

68
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,230
You asked us to split up to look for clues.

69
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,230
Stop arguing!

70
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,120
August 25, 2010.

71
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,190
The Wizard was ten years old.

72
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
In that year,

73
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,670
his mother was killed by gangsters

74
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,070
because she broke an egg.

75
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,150
Until

76
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,710
2040,

77
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,270
the Wizard turned 40.

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,390
Zhang Wei invented the time machine.

79
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,650
The Wizard snatched it

80
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,380
and tried to change his fate

81
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,640
from the earlier past.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,470
He just didn't expect

83
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,710
that the time machine would be broken

84
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,190
and send him back to an earlier time, 1985.

85
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,830
We thought there was no connection.

86
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,590
But one of the triplets is his mother.

87
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,190
So, it triggered a temporal disorder

88
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,950
that resulted in collisions

89
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,350
between 1985 and 2040.

90
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
In the end,

91
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,950
the two dimensions were connected

92
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,360
and formed this apartment.

93
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,610
The seventh floor and above are in the year 1985,

94
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,070
while those below the 7th floor are in 2040.

95
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,670
And the 7th floor, where the tragedy occurred,

96
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,770
is in the year 2010.

97
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,310
The magnetic field at the junction of these two timelines

98
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,550
will be chaotic,

99
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,390
leading to constant anomalies.

100
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,550
That explains

101
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,190
why he stopped chasing us

102
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,310
on the 7th floor.

103
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,830
Why?

104
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,240
Because when he comes back in 2040,

105
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,450
he will become an ordinary person who can be killed.

106
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,950
No wonder we age on the 7th floor.

107
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,910
So, he stays in 1985

108
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,350
and grows up with his mother.

109
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,350
That's right.

110
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,030
It's just that we don't know which one of the triplets is his mother.

111
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,310
But we now know

112
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,270
that he wants to make the most of a bad bargain.

113
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,670
That's why he kept asking the triplets to practice holding eggs in their mouths.

114
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,670
No wonder no one can go out.

115
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,790
Who would have thought that?

116
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,560
Let's not be influenced by others.

117
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,630
Come here.

118
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,230
Let's celebrate your birthday.

119
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,390
After that,

120
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,590
can you let us go?

121
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,150
It's dangerous outside.

122
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,970
Only home is the safest place.

123
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,180
You can't go anywhere.

124
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,720
You're the most dangerous.

125
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,490
(Hotel)

126
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,909
Is this watch so pretty?

127
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,150
Cherish every minute.

128
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,600
I used to live by the day,

129
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,280
but now I live by the second.

130
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,990
Your performance

131
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,890
is really full of emotions.

132
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,990
You must practice

133
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,990
for 60 seconds.

134
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,310
What are you talking about here?

135
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,350
In 25 minutes,

136
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,190
the hotel door will open.

137
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,650
The fog will devour everything here.

138
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,790
All of us will die.

139
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,870
Then what should we do?

140
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,850
What are you thinking?

141
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,790
Shi is his mother.

142
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,950
That man treats Shi too special.

143
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,590
Today is the birthday of all three of them,

144
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,320
but only Shi has a birthday hat.

145
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,670
They all broke the eggs,

146
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,110
but he didn't beat Shi.

147
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,990
At the end of "Fitcher's Bird," the youngest sister kills the wizard

148
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,250
and finally goes home.

149
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,750
But the clues we found

150
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,300
have nothing to do with the third sister, Yi.

151
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,830
I got it.

152
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,500
In that case,

153
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,270
we can take him to the seventh floor and kill him.

154
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,310
Then we can get the key and go out.

155
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,190
How dare you come back?

156
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,720
I wonder if you have the guts

157
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,670
to go back to the first floor,

158
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,150
the time and space that you belong to.

159
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,770
It's useless for you to know about it.

160
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,510
The fog is coming.

161
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,390
All of you will die.

162
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,030
Really?

163
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,350
We

164
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,270
not only know why you came back

165
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,950
but also who your mother is.

166
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,790
Don't you know that?

167
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,230
One of you is his mother.

168
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,430
He's not from 1985.

169
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,780
He's from the future, 2040.

170
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,430
Hey.

171
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
I knew it.

172
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,190
Shi is your mother.

173
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,350
Last time, when Zhang Xinghuo almost hurt the triplets accidentally,

174
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,190
you only saved Shi.

175
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,290
Are we the first players

176
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,270
to know who your mother is?

177
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,630
Does it matter

178
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,150
whether you are the first or not?

179
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,510
All of you will die.

180
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,790
Are you so certain

181
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,670
that we will all die?

182
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,990
Not just you!

183
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,590
The fog is here.

184
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,670
We will die too.

185
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
Yi.

186
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,830
Yan, you got the wrong one.

187
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,830
Don't come over!

188
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,950
I don't agree with your plan.

189
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,600
Just follow the fairy tale.

190
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,840
Finally, the third sister went home.

191
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,710
If we send the third sister home successfully,

192
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,830
we may be able to complete the task.

193
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,830
That makes sense.

194
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,290
Let's make it simpler.

195
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,990
Let's use the second sister, Shi, as a decoy

196
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,020
to divert the Wizard's attention

197
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,020
and seize the opportunity to snatch the third sister.

198
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,510
Your technique of diverting attention

199
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,550
is quite skilled.

200
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,730
But how can we send the third sister home,

201
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,600
or where should we send her?

202
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,710
I feel there are still many details I haven't figured out.

203
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,840
Time is running out.

204
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,750
Get the third sister back first.

205
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,730
This is the 14th floor.

206
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,910
Push her down.

207
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,150
If she dies, there won't be him.

208
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,590
Everything will be over.

209
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,850
But she's just a child.

210
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,190
You can't see the larger issues!

211
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,990
If she dies, we'll all be saved.

212
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,320
Even if you push her down

213
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,230
and the Wizard disappears,

214
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,890
the key will still not appear.

215
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,410
We don't have time.

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,070
You do your work, and I'll do mine.

217
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,790
It depends on luck

218
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,520
whether we will have the key or not.

219
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,630
Go.

220
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,470
Thank you.

221
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,590
Get up.

222
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,390
Get up.

223
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,390
Get in.

224
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,270
Get up.

225
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,270
The fog is coming.

226
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,750
Get up.

227
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
Get in.

228
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,990
Get up.

229
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,870
Get up.

230
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,020
Get in.

231
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,510
Get up.

232
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,350
What are you doing? Help me.

233
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,430
Okay, let's go.

234
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,110
Only five minutes left.

235
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,030
Looks like we only have five more minutes to live,

236
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,750
even though we have saved Shi.

237
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,230
Shi is the key to this door.

238
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,950
We found it too late. It's too late.

239
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,310
Five minutes left.

240
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,870
Are we just waiting to die like this?

241
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,270
We can't make phone calls

242
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,880
or write farewell letters.

243
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,910
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,990
Why?

245
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,590
This is my door.

246
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,350
It has nothing to do with you.

247
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,670
You came because of me.

248
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,940
Not entirely because of you.

249
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,910
Unfortunately,

250
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,200
I haven't joined Obsidian yet.

251
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,630
I know where to go.

252
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,670
Let's try the time machine, okay?

253
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,230
Let's go.

254
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,390
Who is it?

255
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,140
You again?

256
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,830
What do you want?

257
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,500
We need your time machine.

258
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,190
No.

259
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,030
There are still two particularly critical parts

260
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,430
that I haven't resolved yet.

261
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,430
What key parts?

262
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,360
Look.

263
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,190
The first one is the external package.

264
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,430
The external package?

265
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,790
Yes.

266
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,030
Look, this is too boring.

267
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,670
What's the other one?

268
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,790
The other part is its external speaker.

269
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,710
The speaker?

270
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,150
Yes.

271
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,190
Because there will be a lot of noise

272
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,030
when starting a big machine.

273
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,430
At this time, if you have a Bluetooth speaker

274
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,030
paired with music from that era,

275
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,590
I don't think it will be that boring anymore.

276
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,000
I think we should

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,270
value user experience.

278
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,860
These are all...

279
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,590
Hurry up and start the machine.

280
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,910
How many people can the time machine send back at once?

281
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,270
This is the only seat.

282
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,710
We all need to go back.

283
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,610
As long as you dare to sit, I can let you go back.

284
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,590
Which year?

285
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,870
We're going to

286
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,790
August 25, 2010.

287
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,670
All of you, put your hands on him.

288
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,350
I won't be responsible if anyone gets lost.

289
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,590
Are you sure?

290
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,670
Yes!

291
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,430
It still needs music.

292
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,110
Let's make a deal.

293
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,710
The fairy tale you read also has eggs.

294
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,430
Don't drop the eggs.

295
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,750
If anyone's egg falls,

296
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,750
I'll kill them.

297
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,510
You can't blame me for this.

298
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,590
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,700
(Year 2010)

300
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,440
The date is correct.

301
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,070
Who are you?

302
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,510
I know what you want to do.

303
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,790
Leave it to me.

304
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,150
Who are you?

305
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,510
What do you want?

306
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,970
He has had a bad temper since he was young.

307
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,350
Thank you.

308
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,750
I can't accept it.

309
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,850
Although you are pitiful,

310
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,750
what you did was more hateful.

311
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,470
And foolish.

312
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,120
I just wanted to change my misfortune.

313
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,030
I didn't expect it

314
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,490
to cause more misfortune.

315
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,350
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,680
You're the smartest door-passing shepherd

317
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I've ever seen.

318
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,750
Smart?

319
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,510
Smart is the biggest trap.

320
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,350
Many players

321
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,230
will follow the fairy tale "Fitcher's Bird."

322
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,030
They think they can complete the task

323
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,960
by bringing the third sister home.

324
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,240
But you see.

325
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,870
You are so persistent

326
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,530
in changing everything here,

327
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,750
but once it changes,

328
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,950
the history will be altered.

329
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,190
In the future, a brand new version of you will emerge,

330
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,390
and the current you will cease to exist.

331
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Is it worth it?

332
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,270
I don't care.

333
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,430
I just want my mom to live.

334
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,110
Okay.

335
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,750
Okay.

336
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,630
I know you're having a hard time.

337
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,990
If someone had told me this when I was a teenager,

338
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,990
I wouldn't have believed it either.

339
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,990
But he's dying soon.

340
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,750
Say goodbye to him.

341
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,580
Is it over?

342
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,190
Where's the key?

343
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
(Fitcher's Bird)

344
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,480
It looks good on you.

345
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,990
See you at Obsidian.

346
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,990
Okay.

347
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,470
Son.

348
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,310
Mom.

349
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,160
Come here, and I'll peel an orange for you.

350
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,870
Shen, you're back.

351
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,270
- Sesame seed cakes. - No, thanks.

352
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,400
My wife made dinner.

353
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,670
Bye.

354
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,470
Mom, I'm back.

355
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,110
Son, you're back.

356
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,390
I've fixed your old piece.

357
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,710
Okay.

358
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Alright.

359
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,280
Tang Yaoyao failed too.

360
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,950
This door is really weird.

361
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,030
It is said that everyone from Obsidian

362
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,870
has come out.

363
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,490
Am I supporting you just to

364
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,070
have you all die, one by one, inside the door?

365
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,790
Listen.

366
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,520
We don't have much time.

367
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,550
If we don't hurry to pass the Spi Realm,

368
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,030
our good days

369
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,020
will all come to an end.

370
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,050
According to Zhong Chengjian, inside the door,

371
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,550
the ones who came out were two men and a woman.

372
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,550
Yes. One is tall and thin,

373
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,630
while the other is a newcomer,

374
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,560
quite ordinary, with a clean background.

375
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
By the way,

376
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,910
he...

377
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,600
has had dealings with Xiong Qi before.

378
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,550
If they are ordinary people,

379
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,550
you guys are trash.

380
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,480
Boss, you're right.

381
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,390
Was he the one who made the Door Ghost

382
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,120
of the Chief's door disappear?

383
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,510
What's his name?

384
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,710
The first time he entered, his name was Ling Jiushi.

385
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,630
Ling Jiushi?

386
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,010
As the boss of such a large organization,

387
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,410
you didn't even inform me when you got in.

388
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,540
I came here the moment I opened the door.

389
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,150
The clue to the next door.

390
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,040
Consider this my gift upon joining Obsidian.

391
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,950
Move to Obsidian.

392
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,710
Me?

393
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,990
I'm doing quite well here. No need.

394
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,550
Besides, living here,

395
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,350
I can still participate in Obsidian's activities.

396
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,410
It's not a problem.

397
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,170
When you move to Obsidian,

398
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,250
Chestnut might let you get closer to him.

399
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,930
I'm going out to meet someone.

400
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,950
Pack up.

401
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,280
Wait for me to come back and pick you up.

402
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,510
Sir, your coffee is here.

403
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,950
Ms. Liu Ping.

404
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,510
I heard you are a master of door-passing.

405
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,510
This time, when you take me to pass the door, I'm planning to...

406
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,510
I never said

407
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,390
I would take you to pass the door.

408
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,640
What do you mean by that?

409
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,200
I mean it literally.

410
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,070
I see. You want money, right?

411
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,390
I've seen a lot of people like you.

412
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,070
Raising prices with no reason.

413
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,070
Cheque.

414
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,350
Pen.

415
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,620
How much do you want? Tell me.

416
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
How about this?

417
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,030
Whatever money you want, fill it in yourself.

418
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,350
I take people to pass doors not for money.

419
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,790
What do you want then?

420
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,790
I want to leave.

421
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,230
Wait!

422
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,030
I can give you whatever you want.

423
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,960
What are you looking at?

424
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,350
Take our things.

425
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,950
I'll be moving out this afternoon.

426
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,010
You're moving out?

427
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,950
Why so sudden?

428
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,710
I don't want to disturb

429
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,840
your alone time with your girlfriend.

430
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,830
I've gotten used to having you as a third wheel.

431
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,480
Come and visit me more often.

432
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,870
Why do you have to leave?

433
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,930
I'll take a leave now and help you.

434
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,750
Don't.

435
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,540
No need.

436
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,790
Listen,

437
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,430
absolutely don't go beg your lousy boss.

438
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,870
Okay.

439
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,300
When you settle down,

440
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,230
make sure to send me the address.

441
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,110
Also, stop playing that game.

442
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,440
I won't be able to take care of you once you move out.

443
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,110
Okay.

444
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,130
Talk to you later. Bye.

445
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,390
Coming.

446
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,230
Lingling,

447
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,950
welcome to our family.

448
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,710
Come in.

449
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,350
You have a cat?

450
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,440
You are a real cat lover.

451
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,750
What's its name?

452
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,750
Chestnut.

453
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,910
Chestnut?

454
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,240
I don't know if it can get along with Toast.

455
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,310
Want some?

456
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,110
Get to work.

457
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,830
Good girl.

458
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,450
It's quite docile.

459
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,390
Now that we are here,

460
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,920
will Chestnut play with me?

461
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,230
If Chestnut doesn't let you pet him,

462
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,900
I'll let you pet Cheng Qianli.

463
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,550
Brother, do you know that right now, you look like

464
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,010
a wife who has been abandoned by her husband?

465
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,110
Chestnut, don't bully Toast.

466
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,160
Got it?

467
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,310
Welcome, kitty.

468
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,280
How's your preparation going?

469
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,390
Almost done.

470
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,950
When are you leaving?

471
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,950
Tonight.

472
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,590
You're going to enter a door?

473
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,680
Do you want me to accompany you?

474
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,710
I'm aiming for the 10th door.

475
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,630
If you want to accompany me,

476
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,960
you need more practice.

477
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,800
The difficulty doubles

478
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,310
after the sixth door.

479
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,710
How did you get into my second door?

480
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,430
I can easily open any door

481
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,630
before the tenth one.

482
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,570
I discovered it by chance.

483
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,510
Sometimes, the door I just passed and the next one

484
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,680
may be a year apart.

485
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,470
So I have to keep passing through doors

486
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
to stay in my A game

487
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,230
and gather some clues, using them

488
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,740
to communicate with other door-passing shepherds.

489
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
Well,

490
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,880
does that mean you can take me to the 10th door?

491
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,500
What are you thinking?

492
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,640
You want to enter the 10th door when you just passed a door?

493
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,100
Let's talk about it later.

494
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,550
My cat

495
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,830
is quite close to you.

496
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,590
What's yours is mine.

497
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,070
What's mine

498
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,110
is still mine.

499
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,090
You're back, Ruan.

500
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,030
How many times have I told you not to call me Ruan?

501
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,390
Who started it?

502
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,670
Me.

503
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,470
Don't call me that again.

504
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,550
Okay, Ruan.

505
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,630
I'll kick your ass when I'm back.

506
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,510
Are you sure you won't take Yi Manman next time?

507
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,560
I'm not sure about his ability yet.

508
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,710
But I've already figured out

509
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,310
Yi Manman's ability.

510
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,030
All packed up?

511
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,470
All packed up. I don't have many things anyway.

512
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,670
These are the data I've collected from other players' door-passing.

513
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,150
If you're interested, take a look.

514
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,230
Consider it to increase your experience.

515
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,230
Thanks.

516
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,190
Dinner's ready. Come down.

517
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,830
You go ahead.

518
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,550
I have some things to attend to.

519
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,550
Okay.

520
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,390
By the way,

521
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,000
don't eavesdrop in the future.

522
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,390
Okay.

523
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,440
All the dishes are here.

524
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,550
So plentiful.

525
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,550
Lu Yanxue used to run a private kitchen. She's a good cook.

526
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,690
Why isn't Chen Fei joining us?

527
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,350
He's a workaholic.

528
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,550
If there's work to be done, he won't eat.

529
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,270
There's wine?

530
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,430
Ruan is going to pass through the 10th door today.

531
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,630
We should celebrate.

532
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,720
Everyone, there's nothing to worry about.

533
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,350
Ruan is very skilled.

534
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,630
- His 10th door... - Shut up.

535
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,390
Chestnut.

536
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,390
Chestnut?

537
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,550
Where did it go?

538
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,000
I'll go find it.

539
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,670
Aren't you going to eat first?

540
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,800
You eat first. I'll eat after I find it.

541
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,350
Chestnut.

542
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,150
Chestnut.

543
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,750
Chestnut.

544
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
Chest...

545
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,150
Here you are.

546
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,929
I've been looking for you.

547
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,190
Ruan Lanzhu.

548
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
What's wrong?

549
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,550
Help!

550
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,590
Be careful.

551
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,110
Should we call an ambulance?

552
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,110
No, Chen Fei used to study medicine.

553
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,110
He's fine.

554
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,920
He's just too tired.

555
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
Let's get out.

556
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,880
Let him have a good rest.

557
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,750
How is he?

558
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,550
Don't worry. I'm here.

559
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,630
Okay.

560
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,950
Ruan is so skilled,

561
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,550
yet he had trouble

562
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,670
inside the door.

563
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,110
I wonder how my 10th door in the future will be.

564
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,190
You should prepare for your fifth door now.

565
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,190
Stay grounded.

566
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,870
I'll be fine, right, Toast?

567
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,450
The person who entered the door with Ruan

568
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,590
is dead.

569
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,190
How?

570
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,510
He just jumped off the building.

571
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,830
Did you get it?

572
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,320
This door was so difficult to pass.

573
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,910
Only I and one guy survived.

574
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,080
Xia, you are truly formidable.

575
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,190
Did you get the clue?

576
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,590
Our Xia is indeed formidable.

577
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,230
Unfortunately,

578
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,800
the clue ended up being taken by someone else.

579
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,160
I'll see how many clues you can get.

580
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,350
What?

581
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,190
If we get the clue,

582
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,030
will you give us your position, Xia?

583
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:20,430
You'd better focus on getting out alive first.

584
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,340
You don't need to worry about that.

585
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,910
You're awake.

586
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,190
Here, have some water.

587
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,230
Thank you.

588
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,230
Chen Fei said you're fine.

589
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,950
You're just too tired.

590
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,950
You need to take a rest for a few days.

591
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,550
Got it.

592
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,570
I didn't expect Chen Fei to be a medical student.

593
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,270
He was a veterinary student.

594
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,880
Well, he's still a good doctor.

595
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,230
Are you hungry? Let me fix you something to eat.

596
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,730
Cheng Qianli's clue for the fifth door has come out.

597
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,200
It will be in these days.

598
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,550
Go in with him.

599
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,230
Is it "skipping"?

600
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,550
If possible,

601
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,320
I'll take you both to pass the door.

602
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,990
No need.

603
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,390
I can do it myself.

604
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,630
How about we send the food upstairs to Boss?

605
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,750
No need.

606
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,680
Ruan said he would come down to eat.

607
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,350
Ruan must be very sad.

608
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,970
Ruan had known the person who went in with him

609
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,710
for a long time.

610
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,350
Don't think too much.

611
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,440
Have you figured out your door?

612
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,830
Unlike you, I'm not cold-hearted.

613
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,430
You simply don't care about others' lives.

614
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,910
If I cared about others,

615
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,040
you would have died a long time ago.

616
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,910
Am I "others"?

617
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Boss.

618
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,350
Are you feeling better?

619
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
I'm fine.

620
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,350
Have a seat.

621
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,230
Here.

622
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,110
Was Ruan the only person who came out of the 10th door?

623
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,180
And a woman.

624
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
She's quite something.
