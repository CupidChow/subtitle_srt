00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,360
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,000
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,030
Come in.

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,430
There you are.

5
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,870
Sit.

6
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,390
How are you?

7
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,030
I'm feeling quite well.

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,030
What about you?

9
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,229
I'm also doing great.

10
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,320
How did you get that injury?

11
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,790
I have one on my back too.

12
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,000
It's in the same place as yours.

13
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,310
In the 7th door challenge,

14
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,300
the Door Ghost there tried to hunt me down.

15
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,500
How did you get yours?

16
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
I...

17
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,950
I had an accident a long time ago.

18
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,520
My friend chose not to save me,

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,579
and then I got a cut.

20
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,810
What kind of friend would leave you in the lurch?

21
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,390
It happened long ago.

22
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,220
Maybe he just didn't care much about me.

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,110
It's okay.

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,280
Who you're destined to meet

25
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,640
will appear before you,

26
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,520
even if you're in the door challenges.

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,370
Actually, I do want to ask him about all that.

28
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,630
Forget it.

29
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,430
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,950
I'm to blame for what happened in the last door challenge.

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,510
If I had been more competent,

32
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,070
we wouldn't have got in danger.

33
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,200
As I said, I'd always have faith in you,

34
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,110
at present and in the future.

35
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
I've done some thinking.

36
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,470
Since I've decided to accompany you till we finish the 12th door challenge,

37
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,329
I should take on some challenges alone before that,

38
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,110
so I can get more experience.

39
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,650
Aren't you afraid?

40
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,070
The first time I took on a door challenge alone,

41
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,070
I was frightened.

42
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,990
I am afraid.

43
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,160
But only when I get stronger

44
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,190
can I avoid becoming a burden to you.

45
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,680
That's the only way

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,180
we can both survive the 12th challenge.

47
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:11,899
(Baby boy, please don't cry)

48
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:12,684
(Read it 3 times and sleep tight)

49
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,790
Here's a clue about the 3rd door challenge.

50
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,070
You can take on jobs from the online forum,

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,550
or I can introduce a client to you.

52
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,950
But this time, you'll have to

53
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,080
deal with the challenge alone.

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,110
Don't worry.

55
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
Lingling.

56
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,190
Li Dongyuan is here.

57
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,250
He wants to see you.

58
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,810
Are you gonna meet him?

59
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,670
I don't want to.

60
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,790
Lanzhu...

61
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,830
Move it back.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ruan.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Ruan,

64
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,710
are you feeling well lately?

65
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,840
Can't you see if I'm well or not?

66
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,510
Just cut to the chase.

67
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,560
I'm about to enter the 9th door challenge.

68
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,630
Well...

69
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,630
My answer is no.

70
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,710
Do you have to be so distant?

71
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,110
I haven't made you pay for that wicked prank

72
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,240
where you pretended to be Ruan Baijie!

73
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,960
You can try making me pay for it.

74
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,710
Never mind.

75
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,310
It's water under the bridge.

76
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,310
Let's drop it.

77
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,909
We'll focus on today, alright?

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I've heard

79
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,480
that there are a few notes about the 9th challenge in your hands.

80
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,190
So?

81
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,970
Is that the purpose

82
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,410
of your visit to me?

83
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,910
The fruit basket is right out there.

84
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,710
It's huge!

85
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,070
It's the biggest one in the fruit shop.

86
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,630
I genuinely mean to see how you're doing,

87
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,560
though with just a simple request.

88
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,630
Can you sell me the notes?

89
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,670
No way.

90
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,070
How about

91
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,890
you tell me what you want in exchange?

92
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm really running out of time.

93
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,230
Giving you clues about the 9th door challenge

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,830
isn't entirely impossible.

95
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,590
But there is a condition attached.

96
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,590
Name whatever price you want.

97
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,590
I'll pay you as much as I can...

98
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,590
Who's asking for your stinky money?

99
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,390
Yeah. Right.

100
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,070
You've never given priority to money.

101
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,070
Now, tell me what you want.

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,590
I need you to do a door challenge with Ling Jiushi for me.

103
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,720
It'll be the 3rd one.

104
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,070
Baby boy,

105
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,030
please don't cry.

106
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,950
Read it 3 times,

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,620
and sleep tight.

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,820
(Sweet monster)

109
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:19,850
(This game came into my life by chance. I'm scared. Can any experienced players help me with the challenges?)

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,610
(Send me your information, so I can get to know you.)

111
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,610
(Sweet monster)

112
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,790
(Okay. I'm a girl who's just started her freshman year. I'm new to the game and I've been through two door challenges so far.)

113
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,690
(A first-year college girl asking for help)

114
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,710
Read her profile. What do you think?

115
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,080
A first-year college girl?

116
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,080
Are you sure you're gonna team up with her?

117
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,360
Most of the players are strangers to me.

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,670
It doesn't matter who I choose.

119
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,000
She seems to be a rookie.

120
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,270
There could be problems.

121
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,450
What problems could there be?

122
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,590
So many kinds of problems could happen.

123
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,390
You should ask Chen Fei for instructions.

124
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
Okay.

125
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,630
You're about to do a door challenge on your own.

126
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,230
Make sure you'll be careful,

127
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,490
and plan everything as well as possible.

128
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,830
By the way,

129
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,170
bring all your props with you.

130
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,630
Those things

131
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,670
might save your life at critical moments.

132
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,230
I got it.

133
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,230
What's more,

134
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,640
don't easily believe what others say.

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,590
Some people have complicated motives.

136
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,720
Plus, since now we're being targeted,

137
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,030
you must pay attention to even the slightest details.

138
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,310
Okay. I got it.

139
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,950
You've read the clue I gave you.

140
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,630
It's possible that tonight you will...

141
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,890
I'm really aware of it.

142
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,470
How come I've never noticed you're such a nag?

143
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,790
I'm leaving.

144
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,190
Okay. Go talk to Chen Fei.

145
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,130
All sorts of things could happen.

146
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,550
For starters, there can be lies about the levels of the door challenges.

147
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,110
Some people on the online forum would even

148
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,670
give you information about the 7th door challenge,

149
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,600
and declare it's about the 3rd one.

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,870
But I still have to take the challenge head-on?

151
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,470
Yes. You have to.

152
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,090
Before I joined the Obsidian,

153
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
I had fallen for that trick once.

154
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,050
After the challenge started,

155
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,320
I really had an urge to kill that liar.

156
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,670
Therefore,

157
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,350
before a door challenge begins,

158
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,080
you must do some fact checking.

159
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,670
Well, are there other potential problems?

160
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,710
There's one particular problem

161
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,270
that is hard to avoid.

162
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,950
Hmm. Go ahead.

163
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,360
People may give you false personal information.

164
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,110
A 180-cm strong man

165
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,030
might pretend to be a 160-cm girl.

166
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,430
It doesn't sound

167
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,990
too bad...

168
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,030
It's not true!

169
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,730
That hurts our morale!

170
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,590
Isn't it destructive to our hopes and will?

171
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,390
By the way,

172
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,230
when do you plan to take the door challenge?

173
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,990
It's gonna be your first time fighting alone.

174
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,850
We'd like to celebrate it for you.

175
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,250
No need. What's the point of that?

176
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,270
It's a tradition.

177
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,050
Doing a door challenge alone is very dangerous.

178
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,730
Although we hate to receive bad news,

179
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,000
no one can guarantee

180
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,090
that accidents won't happen.

181
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,890
So, instead of a celebration,

182
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,310
we might as well see it

183
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,440
as a farewell party in advance.

184
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,350
That way, should anything happens to you in the door challenge,

185
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,280
at least you've said your goodbyes

186
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,250
to everyone in this house.

187
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,530
Is it really that dangerous to take a door challenge alone?

188
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,950
Taking a door challenge alone isn't scary.

189
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,950
It just means

190
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,040
you'll shoulder more responsibilities.

191
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,030
Can't you say something nice?

192
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,490
You're making it sound like I'm about to die.

193
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,590
Jiushi,

194
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,680
you can leave without worries.

195
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,790
I'll take good care of Chestnut for you.

196
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,990
Don't talk nonsense.

197
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,110
Stop stressing Ling Jiushi.

198
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,670
From today on,

199
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll see Chestnut as my daughter-in-law.

200
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,050
I promise I'll look after her for you.

201
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,840
Let me tell you a secret.

202
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,690
Chestnut is a male cat.

203
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,190
It's okay.

204
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,930
Toast is a male cat too.

205
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
That's a relief.

206
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,190
Hmm.

207
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,350
It's all settled.

208
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,180
I'm leaving, guys.

209
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,430
Good luck!

210
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,950
It's you who took on that job online?

211
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,070
How come you're still playing this game?

212
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you even seeking jobs about it?

213
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,190
Why are you also playing it?

214
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,990
You've even made it to the 3rd door challenge!

215
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,550
Haven't I told you how scary this game is?

216
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,390
Why are you still playing it?

217
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,790
You think I don't know that?

218
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,790
Do I have a choice as a poor employee?

219
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,670
I'm working in a new company whose boss

220
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,270
plans to make a knockoff version of this game.

221
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,530
He's set up KPIs for us.

222
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,270
However, no one has finished this game

223
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,070
up till now.

224
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,830
We have no idea how to copy this game.

225
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,470
So those in the HR department registered us for the game,

226
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,310
and sent us here to experience it.

227
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,190
In fact, I refused it at first.

228
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,510
But they offered high bonuses.

229
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,630
Left with no other option,

230
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,960
I had to cave in to money.

231
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,470
Doesn't your boss know

232
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,390
this game is a threat to people's lives?

233
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,190
How can he not know that?

234
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,190
However,

235
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,550
if he doesn't copy this game,

236
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,830
and develop a popular version of it,

237
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,690
his life will probably be ruined.

238
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,780
It's said that he's deep in debt.

239
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,950
Actually, not only us,

240
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,880
he has also got many other helpers.

241
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,190
He's doing whatever it takes

242
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,650
to complete this project.

243
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,910
He seems to be an unscrupulous boss.

244
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,030
Why are you still working for him?

245
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,550
His unscrupulousness

246
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,230
is mainly reflected on the high bonuses he's offering.

247
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,230
That's true.

248
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,330
People would risk their lives to earn a good reward.

249
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,140
Wait. What does it have to do with your act

250
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,790
of pretending to be a first-year college girl?

251
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,950
Who would've known a game could be so dangerous?

252
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,790
I don't know much about these door challenges.

253
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,520
How am I supposed to solve them?

254
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,470
Besides,

255
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,910
if people like me

256
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,710
don't get help from others,

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,970
we might end up dead without knowing why.

258
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,790
I just didn't imagine

259
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,790
that you'd bite the bait.

260
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,670
Bah!

261
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,190
It's only because I felt pity for you.

262
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,310
Bah!

263
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,830
What's to feel pity about for a first-year college girl?

264
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,630
You were supposed to find her cute, alright?

265
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,630
Oh, come on.

266
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,870
You're already here. Stop whining.

267
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,190
Looking from another perspective,

268
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,190
we've got a chance to play games together again, right?

269
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,190
Stop it.

270
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,670
I wish I could forget

271
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,200
how we used to play games together in the past.

272
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,950
You were a terrible player!

273
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,630
In this door challenge, you'd better not drag me down.

274
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,270
Fine!

275
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,550
Don't worry.

276
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
I will do anything

277
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,750
you ask me to.

278
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,150
Listen,

279
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,980
here is a clue about this door challenge.

280
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,140
Baby boy,

281
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,070
please don't cry.

282
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,390
Read it 3 times,

283
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,510
and sleep tight.

284
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Memorize it.

285
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,200
Oh. What a coincidence!

286
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,150
You're in this challenge too, aren't you?

287
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,200
Why are you...

288
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,230
A client has asked me

289
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,230
to get him a clue about the 4th door challenge.

290
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,290
So I'm here to familiarize myself with the challenges.

291
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,640
This is a friend of mine.

292
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,390
Hello. I'm Gu Longming. This is my 3rd door challenge.

293
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,150
Hello. My name is Meng Yu.

294
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,950
I can't remember how many door challenges I've taken.

295
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,350
All I know is that I'm a veteran of this game.

296
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,910
Meng Yu?

297
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,470
Is he Meng Yu from the White Deer?

298
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,230
It's said that the White Deer is one of the top organizations.

299
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,430
We're the top.

300
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,830
Who can be better than us?

301
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,910
Anyway,

302
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,930
since you're a good friend of his,

303
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,770
I will protect you.

304
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,450
It's true that Ruan Lanzhu is an amazing player,

305
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,990
but I do know a lot about this game too.

306
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,430
Ruan Lanzhu?

307
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,830
Isn't he a friend of yours in that big house?

308
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,510
He works for the Obsidian, doesn't he?

309
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,070
Are you a member of it too?

310
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,710
Does it mean you're also

311
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,170
an expert at this game now?

312
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,970
I'm an expert at every game, aren't I?

313
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,350
You rookie.

314
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Thanks.

315
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,520
Shall we get in the room?

316
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
I'm Yan Shihe.

317
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,270
I've been through 7 door challenges.

318
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,790
Good to see you all.

319
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,069
My name is Qian.

320
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,410
This is my 4th door challenge.

321
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,319
So they're the guys?

322
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,079
They don't seem like it.

323
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,640
I've heard that the boss of the Obsidian

324
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,750
is a smart and sophisticated man.

325
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,770
She's got a great body.

326
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,440
Let's take a closer look at her.

327
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,710
Hello, everyone.

328
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,110
I'm Mrs. Yu.

329
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,670
The River God Festival you'll attend is 7 days away.

330
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,750
But,

331
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,390
from today on,

332
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,390
the sacrificial ceremony will start.

333
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,100
There will be more and more activities in town.

334
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,630
Please feel free to explore around.

335
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,280
There will be less and less people in town.

336
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,710
In 7 days,

337
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,190
your wishes will come true.

338
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,070
This is where you'll be staying.

339
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,070
The rest of the night is yours.

340
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,790
Thank you. Thank you.

341
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,990
Come on. Let's make arrangements.

342
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,350
2 or 3 people will share a room.

343
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,150
There might be trouble if a room is shared by more than 3 people.

344
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,350
Come on. Here you are.

345
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,650
Take care. We'll go get some rest now.

346
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,110
Let's go.

347
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,200
In this door challenge,

348
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,590
I'll protect you.

349
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,030
Don't be so cold.

350
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,920
We're acquaintances after all.

351
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,190
Don't be like that guy.

352
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,510
I'm thinking about something. Leave me alone.

353
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,990
Oh. Why bother yourself with it?

354
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,120
With me here, there won't be a problem.

355
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,930
There seems to be an activity.

356
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,440
Shall we go check it out?

357
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,430
Lingling,

358
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,790
what is that?

359
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,590
It looks alive.

360
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,750
I guess it's for the sacrificial ceremony.

361
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's go and have a look.

362
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,430
Baby boy,

363
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,190
please don't cry.

364
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,070
Read it 3 times,

365
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,870
and sleep tight.

366
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,410
Isn't this the clue we've got?

367
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,510
Is the River God a crying baby?

368
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,150
Baby boy,

369
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,000
please don't cry.

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,990
Read it 3 times

371
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,190
and sleep tight.

372
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,440
How... How could they throw it into the river?

373
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,910
Fellow villager,

374
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,110
what did they throw in the river?

375
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,110
Shut up.

376
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,670
If you don't know, don't ask blindly.

377
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,200
Don't offend the River God.

378
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,170
He is not very knowledgeable.

379
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,770
I'll ask someone else.

380
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,030
Maybe he just genuinely doesn't like you.

381
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,030
Nonsense.

382
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,590
Look at my charm.

383
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,390
Wait.

384
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,230
Miss.

385
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,110
What's wrong?

386
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,470
Let me tell you,

387
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,830
flirting with girls

388
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,430
is his true skill.

389
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,070
Guess

390
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,190
what I asked.

391
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,890
The girl's contact information, of course.

392
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,310
You're not going to badmouth me behind my back, are you?

393
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,350
Impossible.

394
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,040
Hurry up and tell me.

395
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,510
It was a kid.

396
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,350
A kid

397
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,670
was in the red cloth bag thrown into the river just now.

398
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,310
Really?

399
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,910
That's what they said.

400
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,970
Every year during the River God Festival, they throw kids into the river.

401
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,630
The River God Sacrifice is too cruel.

402
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,370
The content inside the door is too harsh.

403
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,570
Far more than that.

404
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,290
Counting down seven days.

405
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,270
On the first day, they'll throw one kid.

406
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,430
On the second day, two kids.

407
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,160
And so on until the seventh day,

408
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,570
they'll throw seven kids.

409
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,030
A total of 28 kids.

410
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,230
Impressive.

411
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
Jiushi.

412
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,910
Let's go.

413
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,510
Let's go back to the town.

414
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,710
Excuse me.

415
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,670
They have to sacrifice kids every year.

416
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,430
Could it be that the River God is the Door Ghost of this door?

417
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,790
Look at their expressions,

418
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,680
Why are they all like this?

419
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,610
There's no joy at all. There must be something wrong.

420
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,470
I'm sorry.

421
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,320
Are you okay?

422
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,950
I'm fine.

423
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,630
What are you doing?

424
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,630
You ask me?

425
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,430
You should ask him.

426
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,110
I... I didn't mean to.

427
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,310
Sir, please let me go.

428
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,950
How could you...

429
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,950
This is my wallet.

430
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,110
Did you see it?

431
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,310
I really

432
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,790
haven't had a meal for several days.

433
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,490
If it weren't for your pitiful state,

434
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,710
I would have to teach you a lesson today.

435
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,270
Bro,

436
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,810
this is ancient times.

437
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,870
Why were you giving him paper money?

438
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,810
Times have to progress, you know.

439
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,110
Kid,

440
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,870
are you hungry?

441
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,790
Open your mouth.

442
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,670
Is it delicious?

443
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,030
Yes.

444
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,830
Thank you.

445
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Let's go.

446
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,650
(Liu's Pharmacy)

447
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,000
Let me open the door.

448
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,510
Do you need something?

449
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,030
Boss,

450
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
what is the River God Festival here?

451
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,190
It's just a prayer for good weather.

452
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,310
That's all?

453
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,110
What else can it be?

454
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,390
Are there any special events?

455
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,110
Nothing special.

456
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,470
Just offering items

457
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,190
that the River God likes.

458
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,390
What is the River God?

459
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,600
Why did you keep asking?

460
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,770
The River God is the River God.

461
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,550
Aren't you asking nonsense?

462
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,350
Do you really throw kids into the river every year?

463
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,110
What do you mean?

464
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,990
Were you suspecting us of deceiving the River God?

465
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,720
That would bring retribution.

466
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,000
Then why did you use so many kids

467
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
for sacrifice?

468
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,200
Why did you sacrifice so many kids?

469
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,030
Why did you have so many questions?

470
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,150
You are non-natives, right?

471
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,550
You should follow local customs,

472
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,710
abide by the rules,

473
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,790
and not defend the River God.

474
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,870
Enough.

475
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,510
I still have business to attend to.

476
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,710
You kept asking

477
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,870
without buying anything.

478
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,330
Who said we're not buying?

479
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,230
You're selling medicine.

480
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,170
Medicines can't be bought casually.

481
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,290
Can we pay with Alipay?

482
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,790
What?

483
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,570
Alipay won't work, how about WeChat?

484
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,440
What are you talking about?

485
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,790
Acting in this manner,

486
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,110
you'll be eliminated by the times sooner or later.

487
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,390
Let's go.

488
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,520
Sorry for the disturbance.

489
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,470
It seems the key lies with the River God.

490
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,870
I noticed that

491
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,390
they all seem to be very afraid of the River God.

492
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,520
But there is no River God in this world.

493
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,350
What if

494
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,590
there's a River God

495
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,570
that scares everyone?

496
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,560
Are you suggesting that

497
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,380
someone was exploiting the fear of the people?

498
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,630
You're the one with quick thinking.

499
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,160
Creating fear,

500
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,710
manipulating a group of people,

501
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,870
and then deceiving the public

502
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,310
can indeed bring immense benefits for the mastermind behind it all.

503
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,310
There are often conspiracies behind many feudal superstitions.

504
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,670
Now, it's about discovering what those enormous benefits are

505
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,510
and who gained them.

506
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,530
Let's assume boldly and verify cautiously.

507
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,950
We still don't know the taboo conditions of this door yet.

508
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,590
The only clue we have now

509
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,250
is sacrificing kids to the River God.

510
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,510
But the children all died

511
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,510
after being thrown into the river.

512
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,240
Even if the kids died, there might still be clues.

513
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,310
This is a way.

514
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,810
Now we have the direction.

515
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,530
It depends on how brave we are.

516
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,120
Are you trying to provoke me

517
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,810
into retrieving the kids?

518
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,790
Of course not.

519
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,710
The White Deer is one of the top teams.

520
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,310
How could they fall for my tricks?

521
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,230
I just pointed out

522
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,760
a problem we're facing now.

523
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,270
Gu Longming

524
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,070
doesn't know how to swim,

525
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,550
and I...

526
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,950
Enough.

527
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,880
How can someone of your size

528
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,710
handle this kind of thing?

529
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,070
I'll go.

530
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,250
I promised someone after all.

531
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,110
What?

532
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,390
It's not a promise.

533
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,070
I just don't want to lose to him.

534
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,870
You've stirred me up to the point of being incoherent.

535
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,030
I need to let you know

536
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,270
that the White Deer holds the top position,

537
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,470
and there is no one deemed as second best.

538
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,000
What are you talking about?

539
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,230
A top player like me

540
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,680
can handle anything,

541
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,710
and everything

542
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,460
and have to do everything,

543
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,430
omnipotent from heaven to earth.

544
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,710
Wait, stop it.

545
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,390
Hurry up and check on the kid.

546
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,970
Do I need to do this?

547
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,540
Aren't you a master?

548
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,150
Aren't you capable of doing anything

549
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,150
and everything?

550
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,070
I'll do it.

551
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
No.

552
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,910
Isn't it a kid?

553
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,470
Did you get the wrong one?

554
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,390
I can't make a mistake.

555
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,190
Isn't it the red cloth bag?

556
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,750
Could it be that

557
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,950
the River God turned the kid into a pig?

558
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,890
I think you look like a pig.

559
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,880
Maybe it wasn't a kid

560
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,560
from the beginning.

561
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,670
Not a kid from the beginning?

562
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,710
Aren't you the top team?

563
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,260
Why can't you do such a simple thing properly?

564
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,150
You listen to me,

565
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,030
go down and try scooping it up again.

566
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,030
Isn't this deceiving the River God?

567
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,900
There is no River God.

568
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,870
I told you, this is superstition!

569
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,870
Enough.

570
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,750
Stop arguing.

571
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,910
I think

572
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,070
people are so devoted to the River God

573
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,520
that they wouldn't tamper with it,

574
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,070
especially with so many eyes watching.

575
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,350
I believe the mastermind behind the scenes

576
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,150
initially used something other than actual kids.

577
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,270
It's gonna have to be you.

578
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,480
What about the kids?

579
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,270
That's the key.

580
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,870
The problem with the door

581
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,390
lies with these kids.

582
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,390
What should we do next?

583
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,750
Let's go back and roast the pig.

584
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,830
That's great,

585
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,070
I'm hungry too.

586
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,790
Lingling.

587
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,190
Are you hungry?

588
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,310
Why are you dragging me?

589
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:38,940
Meng Yu,

590
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,340
wait, you haven't taken the pig?

591
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,940
Aren't you roasting the pig?

592
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,710
Why isn't dinner ready yet?

593
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,270
Your friend has a good appetite,

594
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,910
even in such circumstances still thinking about eating.

595
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,390
Eating is a blessing.

596
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,430
How come you haven't made any progress?

597
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,510
Shame on you.

598
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,470
With both of you around,

599
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,800
what am I worried about?

600
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,470
You guys are indeed the top one

601
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,070
team.

602
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,230
They don't seem like members of Obsidian.

603
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,030
These three are a bit low-level.

604
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,350
That man over there is looking around

605
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,260
like a fool.

606
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,570
Sorry to bother you.

607
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,240
The food will be ready soon.

608
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,710
I have two things to explain.

609
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,230
First,

610
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,680
from 9 P.M.,

611
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,800
please don't wander around

612
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,840
to avoid getting lost.

613
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,710
Rest early.

614
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,230
Second,

615
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,790
don't extinguish the oil lamps.

616
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,070
Make sure to sleep with the lamps lit.

617
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,550
Sleeping with the lamps lit?

618
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,190
Yes.

619
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,070
You must sleep with the lamps on.

620
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,110
How can I sleep with the lamps on?

621
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,639
Who established the rules?

622
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,170
I didn't bring an eye mask.

623
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,949
What did she mean?

624
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,139
Just the NPC explained the rules.

625
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,400
You can choose to listen or not.

626
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,070
How about

627
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,210
you try turning off the lamps?

628
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:56,510
I won't try.

629
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,240
Give it a try.

630
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,390
No.

631
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,830
This bed is so big

632
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,470
that the three of us can sleep comfortably.

633
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,590
Although this oil lamp is small,

634
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,360
it's quite bright,

635
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,260
illuminating the entire room brightly.

636
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,860
Just not knowing what craftsmanship was used,

637
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,710
but this is too bright

638
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,400
and greatly affects the quality of sleep.

639
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,270
I brought an eye mask,

640
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,070
Do you two want one?

641
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,070
No.

642
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,410
It hinders escape.

643
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,930
Now we have to sleep with one eye open.

644
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,950
Yes.

645
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,600
I feel like I'm on vacation.

646
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,350
Well,

647
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,520
you two have to protect me.

648
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,800
Don't worry.

649
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,280
I'll show you

650
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,960
the true strength of White Deer.

651
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,030
Let's sleep.

652
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,590
NPC said that we need to

653
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,550
keep the lamps on while sleeping.

654
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,610
Hurry, go to sleep.

655
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,830
OK.

656
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,990
Dry days, watch out for candles.

657
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,480
Dry days, watch out for candles.

658
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,190
Dry days, watch out for candles.

659
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,990
You're rejecting this room.

660
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Meng Yu.

661
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,470
There's something wrong.

662
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,800
Why is this doll crying?

663
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,870
There's something wrong with this room.

664
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,870
Get up.

665
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Wait.

666
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,030
What is that?

667
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,360
Why is it crying?

668
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,010
It should be a prop.

669
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,110
You've learned a lot.

670
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Hurry and go.

671
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,370
Where are we going now?

672
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,630
No.

673
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,990
No.

674
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,430
No.

675
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
It doesn't cry.

676
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,310
We can stay here tonight.

677
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,030
Can we sleep now?

678
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,150
Sleep.

679
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,210
You should go to bed early too.

680
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,150
Why are you all sleeping like Ruan Lanzhu,

681
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,080
sleeping as soon as you hit the bed?

682
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,360
I wonder how serious his injuries are.

683
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,710
You should sleep too.
