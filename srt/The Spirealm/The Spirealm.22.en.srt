00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,390
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,940
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,070
Last night, you were super scary,

4
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,990
banging on the door over there,

5
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,190
and screaming and scratching the door.

6
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,270
You saw another me?

7
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,630
You've been up all night?

8
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,750
I took a short nap later on.

9
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,210
Let's go eat first.

10
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,550
Without sufficient blood supply to the brain,

11
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,080
we can't think of anything.

12
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,190
You...

13
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,120
You either eat or sleep.

14
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,310
Can't you guys figure out how to get out?

15
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,070
I don't want to die here.

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,350
I'm a bit hungry too.

17
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,110
How about we go eat?

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,550
Wait, you...

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,910
Hey.

20
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,220
If I had encountered what happened yesterday,

21
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,950
I definitely wouldn't be able to eat anything.

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
What if it were the last meal?

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,360
How come even you are like this?

24
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,160
The Madam last night

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,090
probably intended to kill you.

26
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,560
While you didn't violate the true taboo conditions,

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
so she failed.

28
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,820
She was very angry just now,

29
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,680
and glared at you before leaving.

30
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,710
What you saw last night

31
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,630
should be the world inside the painting.

32
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,590
Only this explanation makes sense for

33
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,050
why the door was reversed.

34
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,070
I want to take another look at the painting of Su later.

35
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,070
OK.

36
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,910
Yang Meishu

37
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,800
kept looking over here.

38
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,760
You're more experienced inside the door.

39
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,590
Let's eat.

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,990
It seems like

41
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,870
there's nothing special.

42
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,680
Let's keep looking.

43
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,110
Xiong Qi and others were active outside yesterday.

44
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,440
Maybe we should ask him.

45
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,830
Let's go.

46
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,160
We did find some things.

47
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,990
Why should I tell you?

48
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,150
Xiong, aren't we friends?

49
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,350
Are there ever-lasting friends

50
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
inside the door?

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,810
We can share clues.

52
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,159
We found a taboo condition.

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
You tell me first.

54
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,190
How about this? Write it on a note,

55
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,400
and we'll exchange the notes at the same time.

56
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,200
(Someone at the banquet harbored ill intentions.)

57
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,070
Thank you.

58
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,750
What kind of clue is this?

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,350
(There is a black frame in the bushes.)

60
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,550
It seems a bit flimsy.

61
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,110
If the frame were of any significance,

62
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,240
they would have taken it down long ago.

63
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,110
Last night, I saw the Madam standing in the bushes

64
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,030
outside the window.

65
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,870
I don't know if it's related to this.

66
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,030
What did that imply?

67
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,280
Let's go and take a look.

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830
Here is the frame.

69
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
From this angle,

70
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,230
my room is perfectly framed.

71
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,950
The positioning of this frame is quite cunning.

72
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,030
From other angles,

73
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,470
it's all obstructed,

74
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,510
only your room

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,460
is captured within the frame.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,590
Did you mean that

77
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,070
the Madam turned people into paintings

78
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
using this frame?

79
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,030
Yes.

80
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,560
I'll take it down first.

81
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,190
There were consecutive incidents in your room.

82
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,510
We must be targeted.

83
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,830
They'll definitely strike again.

84
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,070
They are well-versed in taboo conditions.

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,200
We must be cautious.

86
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,950
What good would that do?

87
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,720
It's impossible to defend.

88
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,190
Since there's a connection between the murder and the frame,

89
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,590
let's hide the frame.

90
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,950
Let's see who will come looking for it.

91
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,150
And by sharing this news with everyone,

92
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,909
we not only clarify our position

93
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,150
but also draw the murderer out.

94
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,470
Yes.

95
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,560
That's good.

96
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,820
This way, we make things clear

97
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,280
instead of sneaking around and whispering.

98
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,160
Let's go.

99
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,270
Let's go.

100
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,910
Hide it here.

101
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,070
OK.

102
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's go.

103
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Let's go.

104
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,950
Are you still thinking about the frame?

105
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,870
Not being able to find the person hiding in the shadows

106
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,470
makes me feel uneasy inside.

107
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
How about you come over

108
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,590
and sleep with us tonight?

109
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,590
Three people sleeping together might be a bit crowded, don't you think?

110
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,790
Cheng,

111
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,990
do you think it's crowded

112
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,850
to have three people sleeping together?

113
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:00,950
No.

114
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,470
Not at all.

115
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,990
Let me tell you, it's nice having three people sleeping together.

116
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,870
If anything happens,

117
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,380
we can discuss it together.

118
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,240
I miss the time when the three of us

119
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,530
used to sleep together inside last door.

120
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,230
Okay.

121
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,830
Gather everyone on the sofa

122
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,160
later.

123
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,960
I have something to say.

124
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,470
Do you truly consider me to be your assistant?

125
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you talking about?

126
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,630
I meant

127
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm delighted to serve you.

128
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,030
I just saw a man

129
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,830
scratching the door and screaming continuously.

130
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,710
That's about it.

131
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,990
Brother, you're really lucky.

132
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,590
I'm truly unlucky.

133
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,570
Everyone, be careful.

134
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,330
Try not to touch the frame and the paintings.

135
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,230
Although it may not lead to death,

136
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,090
it's one of the taboo conditions.

137
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,390
It's better to be cautious

138
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,030
until we've figured out the other clues.

139
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,030
If it's really related to the frame,

140
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,350
what should we do when there are picture frames everywhere?

141
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,750
It probably doesn't get triggered solely by the picture frame.

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
There probably

143
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,030
needs to be other conditions occurring simultaneously.

144
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
Last night, Xiong Qi and the others

145
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,370
discovered a crucial situation.

146
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,510
Someone has been using the frame to harm players.

147
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,030
We just don't know if it's the Madam

148
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,470
or

149
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,630
one of the individuals present.

150
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,710
Everyone, rest assured.

151
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,190
We've already dealt with the frame.

152
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,830
If anyone discovers anything

153
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,830
later on,

154
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,040
please inform us promptly.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,590
Have any of you been to

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,380
the art studio on the top floor

157
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,830
and the room where unfinished works are stored?

158
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,830
Didn't the butler say we're not allowed to go to those places?

159
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,830
Why would we go there

160
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,790
and risk our lives?

161
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,320
Does that mean you won't die

162
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,630
if you don't go?

163
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,480
I've given my instructions. Let's go.

164
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,630
Bury the frame and make the news public.

165
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,230
Will that really be fine?

166
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,220
Will they restrain themselves,

167
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,430
or will they act recklessly and reveal their true colors?

168
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,010
Revealing their true colors?

169
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,790
How can a dog reveal its true colors?

170
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,150
We need to quickly find the key.

171
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,810
Those people are unreliable.

172
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,390
How did you know they're unreliable?

173
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,590
Would you completely listen to the NPC's words?

174
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,110
No.

175
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,310
But they would.

176
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,430
Ever since the incident with the girl named Su

177
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,270
on the first day,

178
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,510
everyone has been scared out of their wits.

179
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,030
Only two or three people are actively looking for clues.

180
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,290
The rest are either hiding in their rooms

181
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,830
or waiting in the dining room,

182
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,910
not knowing what they're waiting for.

183
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,310
They just want to lie flat

184
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,950
and wait for someone else to find the door.

185
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,830
Then, they can benefit from those people's good fortune.

186
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,270
Their wishful thinking

187
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,520
is quite something.

188
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,030
Aren't they afraid that if they don't find the key

189
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,470
before the time specified by the Door Ghost,

190
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,030
they'll all be in trouble together?

191
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,030
They don't care

192
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
if everyone dies.

193
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,030
In other words,

194
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,550
people like us who are seriously looking for the key

195
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,030
are paving the way for them.

196
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,030
Maybe it works for the first five doors,

197
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,510
but it won't work

198
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,480
after the sixth one starts.

199
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,830
Where are we going next?

200
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,590
Let's check out the art studio on the top floor.

201
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,230
It's risky, but we have to go.

202
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,350
Hold on, let me knock on the door.

203
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,350
Knock on the door?

204
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,670
I thought he was just talking

205
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,030
and didn't expect him to actually knock.

206
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,870
You've been inside the door with him before,

207
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,390
and you don't know that he behaves like this?

208
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,920
It looks like there's no one here. Let's go in.

209
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,190
Do you need me to keep watch outside?

210
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,470
No, let's go together.

211
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,150
Aren't those us in the picture? They don't have faces.

212
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,470
The Twelve Sufferings.

213
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,800
The Twelve Sufferings.

214
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,240
We only have ten people.

215
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,830
Do those faces

216
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,670
look familiar to you?

217
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,150
Su?

218
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,110
She was

219
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,470
creating her artwork using us.

220
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,750
Only the ones in trouble have faces in the picture.

221
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,210
She is using us to complete her masterpiece.

222
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,270
I never thought she would use such a method to leave a lasting legacy.

223
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
Take another look

224
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,830
and see if there are any other clues.

225
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,440
This painting is quite decent.

226
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,210
It's not as terrifying

227
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,730
and looks pretty good.

228
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,750
Zhu Meng,

229
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,120
come and have a look.

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,230
Red paint?

231
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,190
She used only black, white, and gray for this painting,

232
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,390
not red.

233
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,350
Why did she place red paint here?

234
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,110
HMY?

235
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,390
Why does this brand seem so familiar?

236
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,390
Which brand?

237
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,590
How would I know? I studied science.

238
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,830
Look at this.

239
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,680
This is exactly the same as the red bottle.

240
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,780
Did you remember her teacher?

241
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,590
Huang Mingyuan's

242
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,590
initials

243
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,110
are HMY.

244
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,910
Yes.

245
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,730
(Interviewing painter Huang Mingyuan. Preserving the Essence of Humanity in Paintings.)

246
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,470
Isn't this

247
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,080
Huang Mingyuan's work?

248
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,850
Why did she put it here?

249
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,390
Yes.

250
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,920
Here are also the sketches from the magazine.

251
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,270
It seems they were creating here.

252
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
Lingling.

253
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,570
But the signature is not Huang Mingyuan.

254
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,830
He didn't draw these paintings.

255
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,830
I'm afraid

256
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,430
that Madam didn't plagiarize Huang Mingyuan.

257
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,360
So these are drawn by the Madam?

258
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,850
It's not uncommon.

259
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,030
The renowned sculptor Rodin

260
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,160
had most of his works

261
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,050
created by his female assistant,

262
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,570
yet he claimed authorship

263
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,830
in the end.

264
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,910
According to this logic,

265
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,310
it could be that Huang Mingyuan copied the Madam,

266
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,510
leading to the strained relationship.

267
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,540
Should we go check out

268
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,270
the room where unfinished works are stored next?

269
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670
You've improved.

270
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,670
Let's go.

271
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,110
Look.

272
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,870
Isn't this my room?

273
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,750
Yes.

274
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,570
And a part near the door

275
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
is missing.

276
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,410
Most of the paintings here

277
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,910
have some missing parts.

278
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,950
I stood there last night.

279
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,830
If you hadn't realized that Tan Zaozao was fake

280
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,870
last night,

281
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,350
the missing part

282
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,200
would have been you.

283
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,550
These paintings are interesting.

284
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,870
I wonder if...

285
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,630
Don't touch it.

286
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,750
Ouch!

287
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,870
The scenes in these paintings

288
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,950
almost cover every corner

289
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,550
of the castle.

290
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,230
We can't escape.

291
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,150
Just be careful, and there shouldn't be any problems.

292
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,750
The taboo conditions inside this door are not too difficult.

293
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,990
Now, the most important thing

294
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,830
is to figure out who is harming us.

295
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,490
Isn't that difficult enough?

296
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,390
If it were me last night,

297
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,410
I would have died already.

298
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,430
In that situation,

299
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,490
who could recognize the anomalies around them?

300
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,230
Don't worry.

301
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,950
If you end up turning into a painting,

302
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,950
we will...

303
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,990
Will you save me?

304
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,670
We will carry out your last wish and live well for you,

305
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,950
ensuring you rest in peace.

306
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,950
Good for you.

307
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,510
Let's have meals first.

308
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,870
If there's an issue with these paintings,

309
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,070
have we already fallen victim just now?

310
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,590
For now, these paintings seem safe.

311
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,670
It seems that being enclosed by that frame

312
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,530
is the only taboo condition here.

313
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,590
Yes.

314
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,350
Since the taboo condition is clear now,

315
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,750
we just need to be careful,

316
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,410
and there won't be any danger.

317
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,990
Where's Yang Jie?

318
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,470
Should we exchange information with Xiong Qi?

319
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,990
Yes.

320
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,750
But besides Su,

321
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,030
it seems there's no other information to exchange in The Twelve Sufferings.

322
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,560
I did know a piece of gossip.

323
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,390
The famous painter Huang Mingyuan's works

324
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,430
were actually painted by Madam.

325
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,470
Huang Mingyuan was falsely taking credit for her paintings.

326
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,920
It seems like newcomers are the same everywhere.

327
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,010
Trying to stand out

328
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,830
is never an easy task.

329
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Excuse me.

330
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,150
Is "HMY"

331
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,550
Huang Mingyuan's signature?

332
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,670
Yes.

333
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,950
It is.

334
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,710
Then "WSY"

335
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,930
must be the signature of the Madam, isn't it?

336
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,190
That's right.

337
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,110
You once mentioned

338
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,920
that their master-disciple relationship was good, right?

339
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Yes.

340
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,470
I remember back then,

341
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,320
they were always together,

342
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,450
talking about creations,

343
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,670
art, and the future.

344
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,710
They were laughing and chatting all day.

345
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,830
I still remember

346
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,030
that Mr. Huang once gave the Madam

347
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,960
a bottle of very precious pigment,

348
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,730
which she cherished it so much

349
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,670
that she couldn't bear to use it.

350
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,070
So, what happened later?

351
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,610
Why did they separate?

352
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,630
Well...

353
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm not sure about that.

354
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,850
They had a big fight later,

355
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,330
and then Huang Mingyuan left.

356
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,350
Thank you.

357
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,710
Talking about art

358
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,190
and dreams.

359
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,710
In my opinion,

360
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,070
he just wanted to deceive her with love.

361
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,270
How do you know that?

362
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,390
Intuition.

363
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,910
Huang Mingyuan

364
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,830
is obviously a Pick-up artist.

365
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,870
There are many examples of this kind.

366
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,430
They are not doing anything productive,

367
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,160
just trying to gaslight women.

368
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,070
The story I've been filming recently

369
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,110
is just like that.

370
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,310
In the end,

371
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,110
through the character I portrayed,

372
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,430
we resisted involution and gas-lighting,

373
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,870
promoted positive energy in society,

374
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,870
and shaped

375
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,990
the image of an independent woman.

376
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,780
Independent woman, calm down.

377
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,850
I just can't stand a scumbag getting his way.

378
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,600
Yang Jie is missing.

379
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,870
He's not in his room.

380
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,190
Have you checked nearby? Like the bathroom or something?

381
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,590
I've looked everywhere.

382
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,030
Has there been any change in his room?

383
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,560
Anything added or removed?

384
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,630
Like paintings?

385
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,310
I didn't notice that.

386
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Let's take a look.

387
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,430
It seems to be this room.

388
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,050
The door is not closed.

389
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,350
Why is there a dorm here?

390
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,990
It's exactly the same as the one inside the last door.

391
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,050
Is it an Easter egg?

392
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,600
It's exactly the same as my dorm when I was in college.

393
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,270
Why did the dorm you lived in

394
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,860
appear in the game?

395
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,310
You've passed more doors than I have.

396
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,840
Have you encountered this situation before?

397
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,470
No.

398
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,190
When it appeared inside the last door,

399
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,670
I thought it was a coincidence.

400
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,230
But now it has appeared again.

401
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,870
It's definitely not a coincidence.

402
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,710
I even feel that

403
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,950
this dorm might appear

404
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,990
inside every door in the future.

405
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,570
Every door?

406
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,020
Your college dorm?

407
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,350
That's why I think this game

408
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,910
might be somewhat related to me.

409
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,310
You're overthinking it.

410
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not like you are the protagonist.

411
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,780
I'm a bit confused right now.

412
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,440
I don't know how to express it.

413
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,470
This feeling is...

414
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,510
kinda strange.

415
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,050
During your college days,

416
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,990
did anything special

417
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,120
happen in this dorm?

418
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,030
Whose college life doesn't have stories?

419
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,250
If you keep encountering the same scenes,

420
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,350
it must be a reminder.

421
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,310
Don't think too much.

422
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,310
Let's keep looking.

423
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,670
Maybe

424
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,610
there's also my high school dorm.

425
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,440
Oh right,

426
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,820
are we going to check Yang Jie's room?

427
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,070
No.

428
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,310
He has little possibility of survival.

429
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,510
Besides, the Madam didn't show up when we were having the meal.

430
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,510
It means

431
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,670
she is angry.

432
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,070
Yang Jie probably

433
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,310
wasn't killed by the Madam.

434
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,590
If someone did it,

435
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,390
there should be some flaws exposed.

436
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,750
Come on.

437
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,990
Go find the frame.

438
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,110
Let's split up.

439
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,110
Okay.

440
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Look!

441
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,630
Isn't it the frame I hid in the grass?

442
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,950
It looks like

443
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,400
we've found Yang Jie.

444
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,070
But isn't his target you?

445
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,170
Perhaps the murderer came back for the frame

446
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,510
but ran into Yang Jie.

447
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,510
Then, he killed him to silence him.

448
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,510
If he came to retrieve the murder weapon,

449
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,390
why didn't he take the frame?

450
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,830
He didn't have time.

451
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,350
We had dinner right after Yang Jie died,

452
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,950
and later, Xiong Qi went out to look for him.

453
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,950
Probably, he hasn't got the chance.

454
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,160
We have five girls here.

455
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,510
Besides Cheng, Su,

456
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,870
and Ke,

457
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,400
there are only two left.

458
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm afraid there's only one person

459
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,150
who uses this color of lipstick.

460
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,970
Yang Meishu, the one who asked you to team up.

461
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,730
It turns out she's been acting all this time.

462
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,010
She's still crying today, right?

463
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,320
She has been crying every day since she arrived here.

464
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,360
Let's go back first.

465
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,190
I found it in the bushes.

466
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,450
Then, are we...

467
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,550
Are we all going to die here?

468
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,910
You are a grown man,

469
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,630
yet you are crying like this.

470
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,910
You are even more fragile than me.

471
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,510
What do you think we should do?

472
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,630
Another person has turned into a painting.

473
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,750
Didn't you see it?

474
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,030
How would I know?

475
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,070
Am I your mom?

476
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,070
Ridiculous.

477
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
Come out with me.

478
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,570
There are some things I need to confirm with you.

479
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,590
You're getting better and better at it.

480
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,310
It's good to sleep on the floor.

481
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,070
You don't have to squeeze in with others,

482
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,000
and you can roll around as you like.

483
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,710
It's really great to sleep on the floor.

484
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,880
And that's not true.

485
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,350
Ruan Lanzhu, you're so stingy.

486
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,410
I'll remember you.

487
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,670
Are you still thinking about that room?

488
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,670
Yes.

489
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,430
I just find it a bit weird.

490
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,510
How could my old college dorm

491
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,070
appear in the game?

492
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,390
Does that room

493
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,450
have any special meaning for you?

494
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,950
There was...

495
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,230
my good friend there.

496
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,670
But we've drifted apart now.

497
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,830
After graduation, everyone goes their own way.

498
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,030
It's normal.

499
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,030
We parted on bad terms.

500
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,350
And we haven't seen each other since.

501
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,590
Back then, we shared a dream

502
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,050
of changing the world.

503
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,510
Now, it seems like the world has changed me.

504
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,950
The world...

505
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,310
won't change for people.

506
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,350
That's true.

507
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,390
But I've always believed

508
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,600
that people can change the world.

509
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,510
Alright, go to bed early.

510
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,470
Next time when you are going to change the world,

511
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,130
remember to bring me with you.

512
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,070
Zhu, open up! Zhu Meng!

513
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,910
Open up! Zhu Meng!

514
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,190
Xiong is in trouble.

515
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,870
He got captured into the world inside the painting.

516
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,670
What happened?

517
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,470
I was going to get into the painting to save him,

518
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,270
but he fought hard to push me out.

519
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,540
Let's go.

520
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
Go!

521
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,070
-Xiong Qi! -Xiong!

522
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,310
Xiong Qi!

523
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,750
Hang in there, Xiong Qi. I'm here to save you.

524
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,750
Xiong!

525
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,190
Xiong!

526
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,950
Xiong.

527
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,110
Xiong.

528
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,270
Xiong?

529
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,190
Xiong.

530
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,750
Can you hear me?

531
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,730
Xiong, you're finally awake.

532
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,030
How do you feel?

533
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,990
How do you feel?

534
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,870
What happened?

535
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,950
I brought them into the painting to save you.

536
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,590
Fortunately, we arrived in time.

537
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,590
That's why you're alive and out now.

538
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,830
Brother.

539
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,110
Thank you for saving me while disregarding yourself.

540
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,930
It looks like the lady in the rain was not very pleased with you.

541
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,280
You entered the world inside the painting.

542
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
That means

543
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,480
that person went after you as well.

544
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Yang Meishu?

545
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,320
You have also been out to check.

546
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,560
Haven't you noticed

547
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,200
that she placed a frame?

548
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,750
We are from the same organization.

549
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,910
She really wants me to die!

550
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,750
Yang Meishu works for Xia.

551
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,790
Xia wants to get rid of me

552
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,830
so that she can be the biggest shot in the organization.

553
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,490
When I first entered the door,

554
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,110
I was thinking of Mengmeng's death,

555
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,170
so toward you, I...

556
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,030
I'm sorry.

557
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
It's okay.

558
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,070
Lingling has told you so many times, but you didn't believe him

559
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,870
and insisted on having evidence.

560
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,270
There's no evidence now,

561
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,510
but you've already drawn a conclusion.

562
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,830
It was my fault.

563
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,710
I won't stay

564
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,370
in an organization like this.

565
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,510
I'll withdraw.

566
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,590
I even wanted you guys to join before.

567
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,950
I feel ashamed.

568
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,760
In which door did Ke have the incident?

569
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,870
Xiong is in trouble.

570
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,710
He got captured into the world inside the painting.

571
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,470
What happened?

572
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,310
I was going to get into the painting to save him,

573
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,110
but he fought hard to push me out.

574
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,430
Let's go.

575
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,430
Go!

576
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,830
The seventh door.

577
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,040
She did it to protect me.

578
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,580
It was all my fault.

579
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,110
Inside the door, I relied on sheer brute force,

580
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,570
reckless and unthinking.

581
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,910
Later,

582
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,310
I met someone.

583
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,030
I don't know by what means he managed

584
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,670
to enable Ke

585
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,630
to continue passing doors with me.

586
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,230
Who is it?

587
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,310
All I know

588
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,430
is that he is a master.

589
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,310
It's good, actually.

590
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,480
Although I can only live inside the doors,

591
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,160
at least I'm still alive

592
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,000
and can pass doors with him.

593
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,410
I'm content with that.

594
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,199
With her by my side when passing doors,

595
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,080
I feel much more at ease.

596
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Thank you...

597
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,630
for tonight.

598
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,070
Now that

599
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,050
there's no secret between us,

600
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,480
I'll be honest with you.

601
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,310
I wasn't captured into the painting

602
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,840
without gaining anything.

603
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,310
I found the key.

604
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,110
It's within the world inside the painting.

605
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,070
Oh no.

606
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,909
It's too dangerous.

607
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,030
How can we get the key?

608
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,949
It's quite a coincidence.

609
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,030
With Ke's help,

610
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,510
we can obtain the key.

611
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,070
How should we cooperate?

612
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,929
Ke can enter the painting.

613
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,710
You guys are responsible for getting the key.

614
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,310
She will distract the Madam.

615
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,440
How will you distract the Madam?

616
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,830
We can't enter the world

617
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,510
inside the painting casually.

618
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,310
Besides,

619
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,390
we can only enter if we are framed within the painting.

620
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,440
Entering the world inside the painting

621
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,750
is equivalent to a one-on-one duel with the Madam.

622
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,510
There's no chance of winning.

623
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,710
Don't worry.

624
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,670
We have an idea.

625
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,990
Since Ke can distract her,

626
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,370
why don't you go get the key?

627
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,670
I can distract the Madam,

628
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,150
but I need Xiong's help.

629
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,150
So, we have to rely on you guys

630
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,670
for getting the key.

631
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,870
No.

632
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,350
I feel especially insecure now.

633
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,670
After all,

634
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,670
you guys kept so much from us before.

635
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,310
We understand.

636
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,710
Zhu Meng.

637
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
We're friends.

638
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,470
Fine.

639
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,790
I agree

640
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,680
with your proposal.

641
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,520
At night, her combat strength is formidable.

642
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,480
We'll act during the day tomorrow.

643
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
How do you plan

644
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,710
to distract the Madam?

645
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,910
Once I enter the painting,

646
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,430
the Madam will enter the world inside the painting

647
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,430
to hunt me down.

648
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,710
That's when I can distract her.

649
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,350
After Ke enters the painting,

650
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,030
you guys can enter the house to get the key.

651
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,830
The key is in the Madam's studio.

652
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,510
Okay.

653
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,840
Well, how do you plan

654
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,710
to deal with Yang Meishu?

655
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,910
I never hit women.

656
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,330
But I've warned her not to mess up with us.

657
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,270
She'll pay the price.

658
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,310
Thank you again

659
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,760
for tonight.

660
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,310
Tomorrow,

661
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,510
you and Cheng wait outside.

662
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,840
I'll go in to get the key.

663
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,030
Let me do it.

664
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,070
If I encounter danger inside,

665
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,130
you can lend a hand.

666
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,030
If you encounter danger,

667
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,270
she and I

668
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,810
may not be able to help you.

669
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,710
You can't always protect us.

670
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,030
Xu Xiaocheng.

671
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,350
What, what's up?

672
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,200
You look so serious,

673
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,870
and called me by my full name.

674
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,150
Nothing.

675
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,830
I just want to praise you.

676
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,080
That mirror is really nice.

677
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,470
Of course.

678
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,880
I didn't expect that mirror to have

679
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,140
this kind of function.

680
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,000
Where did you get it?

681
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,190
I...

682
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,870
A friend gave it to me.

683
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,470
Gave it to you

684
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,470
or sold it to you?

685
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,680
This is your fifth door.

686
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,670
Looks like

687
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,670
you're already preparing for your sixth door.

688
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
You

689
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,630
don't blame me?

690
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,710
I don't blame you.

691
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,710
I thought you'd hate it

692
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,070
and consider buying props as cheating in the game.

693
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,770
It's quite embarrassing.

694
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,600
I used to think that way.

695
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,750
I thought that using props to get keys

696
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,870
wasn't honorable.

697
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,070
But after seeing Ke just now,

698
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,510
I understand.

699
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,130
Cheating is just a way to survive.

700
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,920
What's wrong with that?

701
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,270
It's wrong when cheating

702
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,630
harms others.

703
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,300
You've

704
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,270
really changed a lot.

705
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,510
I learned from him.

706
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,710
Is that a compliment?

707
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,870
You should be more careful.

708
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,310
What if the prop is fake? What would you do then?

709
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,310
It can't be.

710
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,710
Don't worry.

711
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,470
I've been in society for a long time.

712
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,470
And the guy who sells props

713
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,050
said he knew you both well.

714
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,680
He gave it to me for free.

715
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,840
Take Lingling's words seriously.

716
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,310
You were lucky this time.

717
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,670
If you had met someone selling fake props,

718
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,670
you'd be in trouble inside the door.

719
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,710
Got it.

720
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,830
Go to sleep.
