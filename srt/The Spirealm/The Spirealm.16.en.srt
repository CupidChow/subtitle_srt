00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,330
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,070
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,950
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

4
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,950
That's hilarious.

5
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,670
She likes bananas very much,

6
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,710
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

7
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,870
What a poor thing!

8
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,550
Sako has gone far away.

9
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,950
She'll forget me, won't she?

10
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,229
So lonely, Sako.

11
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,229
Why would she come here for me again?

12
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,590
Can you hear it?

13
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,230
Can you hear it?

14
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,470
Can you hear it?

15
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,340
Can you hear it?

16
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,270
Can you hear it?

17
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,910
Can you hear it?

18
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,990
What do you want me to hear?

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,190
Some sort of singing?

20
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,070
Crying.

21
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,790
She cried in agony.

22
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,390
Why did no one hear her?

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,350
Who was crying?

24
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,430
Was it you?

25
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,670
She did nothing wrong.

26
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,620
Why would they treat her like that?

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,590
Jiang Xinhong!

28
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,310
Help me!

29
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,470
Don't leave.

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,190
Jiang Xinhong.

31
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,750
Jiang Xinhong, don't go!

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,710
She's beyond help, Jiang Xinhong!

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,710
Go!

34
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,990
Let's go! She's beyond help!

35
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,750
It's Mou Kai.

36
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,870
I beg you...

37
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,950
Don't go!

38
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,550
Don't go away!

39
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,910
- It hurts! - Do you hear it?

40
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,950
It hurts!

41
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,829
She's in enormous pain.

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,470
I beg you!

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,230
Don't go!

44
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,270
Don't go away!

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,270
You...

46
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,390
How do you want me to help you?

47
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,510
Do you want me to bring those guys to you,

48
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,510
so that they can be at your disposal?

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,470
You're a good person.

50
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,090
I want you to have this.

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,710
What is this?

52
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,330
Why are you giving it to me?

53
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,110
Because you like kaleidoscopes too.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,150
Isn't it what I saw last time in...

55
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,620
So you didn't get any sleep last night?

56
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:48,110
I don't care if she did or did not stop by.

57
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,270
She...

58
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,150
What was she here for?

59
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,110
To give me this.

60
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,790
These two photos are different.

61
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,710
The new one has Sachiko, while the old one doesn't.

62
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,920
The number of people is different too.

63
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,030
It seems that

64
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,440
when a member of the class dies,

65
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,840
there will be one more person in the photo.

66
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,030
Let me see.

67
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,030
So the two spots in the middle

68
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,070
are reserved for Mou Kai and Jiang Xinhong, right?

69
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,260
Anyway,

70
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,990
we'd better find them first.

71
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,400
Plus, it's possible

72
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,950
that only when they both show up in the photo

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,200
will the key appear.

74
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,040
It looks like Sachiko really wants them dead.

75
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,630
You phony!

76
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,470
But they are not in the school.

77
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,970
What can we do to find them?

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,290
We'll go talk to Mr. Liu again.

79
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,310
By the way, Lingling,

80
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,030
did Sachiko's ghost just give you that kaleidoscope?

81
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,330
Why is every female Door Ghost

82
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,950
attracted to you?

83
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,270
Is that a problem?

84
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,590
No.

85
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,030
Hello.

86
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,590
I'm Mr. Liu, a teacher at Ying Cai High School.

87
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,710
Mr. Liu, hello.

88
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,950
Hello.

89
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,510
Listen, I have a question.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,990
Is Mou Kai home?

91
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,270
Mou Kai...

92
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,000
He went to school early in the morning.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
What?

94
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,110
He came here early in the morning?

95
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,310
Who asked him to come?

96
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,630
I don't know.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,150
He left in a hurry.

98
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,430
Okay. I got it.

99
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,110
Mou Kai's family said

100
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,120
he had set out for school early in the morning.

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
Who asked him to come?

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,710
His family said they didn't know.

103
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,230
They just said he had come here early in the morning,

104
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,960
and that he left home in a hurry.

105
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,320
Take care of your injuries.

106
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,170
You've done a good job.

107
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,870
You won't come here again, will you?

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,710
Jiang Xinhong, come out!

109
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,730
Didn't you say you had found a way to deal with Sachiko's ghost?

110
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,110
Jiang Xinhong!

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,390
It wasn't me.

112
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,670
It really wasn't me.

113
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,190
It was Jiang Xinhong!

114
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,100
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

115
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,740
- That's hilarious. - It really wasn't me.

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,560
She likes bananas very much,

117
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,030
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

118
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,110
What a poor thing!

119
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,670
Sako has gone far away.

120
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,510
She'll forget me, won't she?

121
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,790
So lonely, Sako.

122
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,000
Who saw the snowflakes drifting?

123
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,610
Who was abandoned in the middle of the road?

124
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,190
What's the last line?

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,340
I don't know.

126
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,110
Didn't you guys write this song?

127
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,150
How could you not know the last line?

128
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,830
I really don't know that.

129
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,900
I really don't!

130
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,790
I've lost my legs.

131
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,990
Would you give me yours?

132
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,310
I don't know!

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,460
I really don't know!

134
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,110
Stop it! I don't know!

135
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,550
Sachiko, I really don't know that.

136
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,110
I don't know...

137
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,730
I really don't know...

138
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,630
I really don't know!

139
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,470
I don't know!

140
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,590
I really don't know!

141
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,110
Stop it, Sachiko!

142
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,790
Stop it! I don't know a thing!

143
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,590
I really have no idea!

144
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,590
I don't know!

145
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,910
I really don't know! Stop it, Sachiko!

146
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,430
I don't know.

147
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,470
I really don't know!

148
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,990
I don't know!

149
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,780
Stop it!

150
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,270
I've lost my legs.

151
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,790
Would you give me yours?

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,760
There's only one spot left.

153
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,390
We must find Jiang Xinhong as soon as possible.

154
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,110
I've got a call from Jiang Xinhong's family,

155
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,550
who said he came to school early in the morning too!

156
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,150
I've asked his classmates,

157
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,550
but no one has seen him.

158
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,270
Has he been killed by Sachiko's ghost?

159
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,810
No.

160
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,290
The spot for him in the photo is still vacant.

161
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,510
I know where he is.

162
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,270
Mou Kai is dead.

163
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,110
I'll be the next one.

164
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,590
Are you gonna hide here forever?

165
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,350
When you bullied Sako,

166
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,310
didn't it occur to you that she'd feel scared,

167
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,310
and hopeless?

168
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,990
When did I bully her?

169
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,350
I never bullied her.

170
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,270
I never ever bullied her.

171
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,480
Who said that to you?

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,070
Who said I bullied her?

173
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,470
Was it Mou Kai?

174
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,550
Was it him?

175
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,110
Was it Mou Kai?

176
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,470
Was it Mou Kai?

177
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,710
Ridiculous!

178
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,830
Has he gone crazy?

179
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,750
This is ridiculous!

180
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,550
He's the culprit.

181
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,270
How could he shift all the blame to me?

182
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,450
You'd better make it clear now.

183
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,350
Will you still believe

184
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,910
what I'm gonna say?

185
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,350
We'll decide whether to believe you or not.

186
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,950
You'll decide whether to tell the truth or not.

187
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,550
Sachiko and I

188
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,630
knew each other when we were little.

189
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,320
Back then,

190
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,070
every few days,

191
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,150
her family would bring fresh fish to my house.

192
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,590
Later, as we grew up,

193
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,830
I was sent to a noble school,

194
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
while she

195
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,390
went to an ordinary high school in the city.

196
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,270
But we'd still meet on weekends.

197
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,190
Thank you, Xinhong.

198
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,470
Afterwards,

199
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,550
one day, Sachiko's parents

200
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,690
had an accident when delivering fish to the customers.

201
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,990
They were hit by a car

202
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,600
and didn't survive.

203
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,920
The one who hit Sachiko's parents was Mou Kai,

204
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,830
who had just learned how to drive.

205
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,800
His family settled the matter with money

206
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,790
and promised to arrange

207
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,990
the best school for Sachiko.

208
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,590
Sachiko's grandparents had no choice

209
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,630
but to reluctantly agree.

210
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,750
What I didn't expect was

211
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,710
that Sachiko actually became our classmate.

212
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,350
Of course, I was very happy about it,

213
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,350
but Mou Kai wasn't.

214
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,030
He was afraid that Sachiko would take revenge on him,

215
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,350
so he started spreading rumors about her

216
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,230
among our classmates.

217
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,630
Gradually,

218
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,950
Mou Kai started to doubt my relationship with Sachiko.

219
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,100
He brought a lot of people to question me.

220
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,020
Mou Kai had a lot of influence in school.

221
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,850
I was afraid to offend him.

222
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,270
I was also afraid of being isolated.

223
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,270
So I told them

224
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,830
that I also hated that girl.

225
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,350
Since you also hate her,

226
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,790
do you

227
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,550
dare to play a game with us?

228
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,950
What game?

229
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,030
I have a letter here.

230
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,430
Give it to the fishmonger girl.

231
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,670
(To Sachiko)

232
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,270
Why are you doing this?

233
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,000
We've been bored these days.

234
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,660
Let's have some fun.

235
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,430
This is too...

236
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,710
Hey,

237
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,270
are you reluctant to do it?

238
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,190
Yeah.

239
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,150
I'll do it.

240
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,390
I was really afraid to offend him.

241
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,350
So I had to do as he said.

242
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,790
Actually, many times,

243
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,180
I really wanted to tell Sachiko the truth.

244
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,140
But every time...

245
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,110
I would run into Mou Kai.

246
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,790
Jiang Xinhong.

247
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,150
I'll leave first.

248
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,630
Okay.

249
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,430
Jiang Xinhong.

250
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,350
Where are you going?

251
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,110
I...

252
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,020
There are guests coming to my house today.

253
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,960
I wanted to order two fish from her.

254
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,350
Fine.

255
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,990
If you dare to tell her about our plan,

256
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,470
I'll make you regret it.

257
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,310
I... Bastard!

258
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,950
You bastard!

259
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,150
My parents

260
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,470
also worked under Mou Kai's parents.

261
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,870
I didn't dare to offend him.

262
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,150
Until the picnic day...

263
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,550
If you don't leave now, we won't be able to take photos today.

264
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,470
Don't you realize that you smell bad?

265
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,470
Get lost!

266
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,790
Everyone, look at the camera.

267
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,790
Cheer up.

268
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,869
Come on.

269
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,550
Three, two, one.

270
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,610
Okay.

271
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,150
It's free time now.

272
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,430
Don't go to dangerous places.

273
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,109
Be careful.

274
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,349
I couldn't imagine how Sachiko would react

275
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,230
if I had told her the truth.

276
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,030
Sachiko,

277
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,110
how about we play a game?

278
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,910
You stinky fishmonger.

279
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,510
Stop pretending to be aloof.

280
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,310
Don't think we don't know

281
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,440
what kind of person you are in private.

282
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,110
I have a letter here.

283
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,950
Let me read it to everyone.

284
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,310
Do you want to hear it?

285
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,030
Yes.

286
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,870
Mr. Xinhong.

287
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,000
Give it back!

288
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,590
Mr. Xinhong.

289
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,790
Give it back!

290
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,990
Seeing your words is like seeing you in person.

291
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,110
Give it back to me.

292
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,750
During the time in school,

293
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,780
our literary exchanges

294
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,750
brought me great joy.

295
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,060
Let go!

296
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,720
Stop reading.

297
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,470
Do you remember the first time I saw you when we were kids?

298
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,240
Stop reading.

299
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
At that time,

300
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,190
I felt inferior because I was from a fish-selling family,

301
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,150
but it was your smile that gave me confidence.

302
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,870
How did Xinhong smile?

303
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,110
Get off me.

304
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,990
You smell so bad. How can you go to school?

305
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,390
Give me the water bucket.

306
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,310
Acting aloof, huh?

307
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,280
Dare you pretend to be aloof with me again?

308
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
Sako.

309
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,270
Sako.

310
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,150
Sako.

311
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Sako.

312
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,870
Jiang Xinhong.

313
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,110
Why did you do that?

314
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,150
I...

315
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,910
Why did you give the letter to Mou Kai?

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,710
Say something. Why?

317
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,870
Hey!

318
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,190
Are you waiting for your boyfriend here?

319
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,350
Did he force you to say it?

320
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,590
Say something.

321
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,430
Did he force you to do this?

322
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,150
Tell her.

323
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,470
Did I force you,

324
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,290
or did you do it willingly?

325
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,430
I did it myself.

326
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,230
Did you hear that?

327
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,870
Let's go.

328
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,470
Jiang Xinhong.

329
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,910
So annoying.

330
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,150
Jiang Xinhong, I don't believe it.

331
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,270
Are you done?

332
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,710
Are you done?

333
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,670
Jiang Xinhong!

334
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,550
Jiang Xinhong, don't leave!

335
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,510
Jiang Xinhong!

336
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,590
Leave her alone, Jiang Xinhong.

337
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,430
You can't help her.

338
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,430
Help me!

339
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,230
Don't go, Jiang Xinhong!

340
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,590
How can you save her like that? Jiang Xinhong.

341
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,990
Let's go, Jiang Xinhong!

342
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,310
Jiang Xinhong!

343
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Go!

344
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,950
Don't leave.

345
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,820
Don't leave.

346
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,470
You all know

347
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,750
what happened later.

348
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,230
You wrote that ironic song about Sako, right?

349
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,310
I didn't write that song to mock her originally.

350
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,270
I wanted to remember her.

351
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,090
But the lyrics were changed by Mou Kai later.

352
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,510
She didn't even know about it at all.

353
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,410
(Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little. She's an independent girl.)

354
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
(She taught me a lot. Now I want to write a song for her.)

355
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,950
Don't you want to see her?

356
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,850
What's the meaning of seeing her?

357
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,160
So you just want to hide here for the rest of your life?

358
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,030
Don't you have friends whom

359
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,510
you want to see but are afraid to see?

360
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
I really don't have the courage.

361
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,190
After Sako died,

362
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,760
she'd been carrying this with her.

363
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,150
Now,

364
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,280
I'll give it back to you.

365
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,730
But you, Jiang Xinhong,

366
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,670
don't deserve to be remembered by her.

367
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,270
Let's go.

368
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,910
Wait.

369
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,260
I'll go with you.

370
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,440
(Class 2, Grade 1)

371
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:15,070
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

372
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,110
That's hilarious.

373
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,550
She likes bananas very much,

374
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,310
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

375
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,470
What a poor thing!

376
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,670
Sako has gone far away.

377
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,830
She'll forget me, won't she?

378
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,790
So lonely, Sako.

379
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,830
You wrote

380
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,550
this song, right?

381
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,950
It's beautiful.

382
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,550
No.

383
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,350
It wasn't like this originally.

384
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,130
I don't believe it.

385
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,110
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

386
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,150
She's an independent girl.

387
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,190
She taught me a lot.

388
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,350
Now I want to write a song for her.

389
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,190
She likes bananas very much,

390
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,990
but she always leaves half of it for her parents.

391
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,440
She has a hard life,

392
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,990
but she always smiles at it.

393
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,950
One day, Sako will go far away.

394
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,070
Will she forget about me then?

395
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,990
Maybe she'll feel lonely and lost,

396
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:09,470
just like every time I think of her.

397
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,230
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,550
I shouldn't have done that. It was my fault.

400
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,550
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,630
I wish I had more courage.

402
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,720
Do you know what the last line of

403
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,240
the lyrics says?

404
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,230
I know.

405
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,190
You would ask me,

406
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,110
"I've lost my legs.

407
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,470
Would you give me yours?"

408
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,950
I, Jiang Xinhong, now

409
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,480
will tell you without hesitation.

410
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,270
Yes.

411
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,830
Yes.

412
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,870
Okay.

413
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,790
I know.

414
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,350
I know.

415
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,960
It'll be too late to forget you

416
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,630
In this desolate world

417
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,340
You won't be there

418
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,570
No one can escape the destined game of separation

419
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,320
This ridiculous fate

420
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,990
Only you are willing to

421
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Wait for a snow with me

422
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,440
Wait for the stars to fill the sky

423
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,710
Let this moment

424
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,100
Be worth 10,000 light years

425
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,510
This Sachiko

426
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,560
was quite an honest person.

427
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,470
Person?

428
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,150
Well, an honest ghost.

429
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,350
Jiang Xinhong.

430
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,590
I wish you

431
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,110
all the best.

432
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,950
I will carry the memory of Sako

433
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,750
and move forward.

434
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,110
Until the night and day blur

435
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,070
You will be

436
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,180
Behind me

437
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I know

438
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
From afar

439
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,910
Looking me

440
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
In the eye

441
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,360
Will we

442
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,520
Meet again

443
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,900
In some other time and space

444
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,740
To have you in my arms

445
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,510
I won't give up

446
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,110
It seems

447
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,670
that we shouldn't joke about love,

448
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,990
nor play pranks on people.

449
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,550
Otherwise,

450
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,260
it can be taken seriously.

451
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,950
I think he's right.

452
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,870
I think he's right too.

453
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,060
What about the other door-passing shepherds?

454
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,470
Should we tell them where the door is?

455
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Don't worry.

456
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,980
They will definitely find the door to go out.

457
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Besides,

458
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,390
there are no strange things

459
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,250
guarding the doors in this world.

460
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Zhuang.

461
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,320
Go and open the door.

462
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Let's go.

463
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
By the way,

464
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
Meng Yu,

465
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,020
I have something to tell you.

466
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,590
Actually, Baijie...

467
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
It's me.

468
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,420
Ruan Lanzhu!

469
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,420
I'm going to kill you!

470
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,100
Let's go and eat.

471
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,510
You're back.

472
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,070
You're back.

473
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,860
I made night snacks.

474
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,270
Have some before they are cold.

475
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,940
Coming.

476
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Here.

477
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,430
Be careful.

478
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,870
Okay.

479
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,980
Just take one bowl.

480
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,960
Are you still thinking about Sachiko?

481
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,030
Didn't you say

482
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,920
not to tell Li Dongyuan about Baijie?

483
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,400
Why did you change your mind and tell him?

484
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,620
I pitied him.

485
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,020
What did your childhood friends look like?

486
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
I forgot.

487
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,950
How could someone forget their childhood?

488
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,820
Maybe I was so happy

489
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
that I forgot,

490
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,470
or maybe I was so miserable

491
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,150
that I forgot.

492
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,750
You have a bad memory.

493
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,060
Weird.

494
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,670
In the future,

495
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,300
you will find that I am weirder than you think.

496
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Fortunately,

497
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,000
you have had friends since young.

498
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,430
Otherwise,

499
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,500
you might become another Sachiko.

500
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,280
Do you believe that?

501
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,150
It was my good friend

502
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,469
who made me

503
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,900
a laughing stock.

504
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
I believe that.

505
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,300
When I find him,

506
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,909
I'll avenge you.

507
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,080
Forget it. It's all in the past.

508
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,219
Where are your good friends now?

509
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,070
They are with me now.

510
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,060
I passed the door of Sako with them just now.

511
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,639
The Spring Festival is around the corner.

512
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,469
I'm not lonely

513
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,080
if I can celebrate the festival with you all.

514
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,940
(Li Dongyuan)

515
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,110
Ruan Lanzhu, you bastard!

516
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,470
I'll teach you a lesson!

517
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Get prepared

518
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,540
and meet someone with me.

519
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,820
So early?

520
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,990
Ruan. Lingling.

521
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,720
Have a seat.

522
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,730
Where is he?

523
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,440
He'll be here soon.

524
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
Ruan.

525
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,580
He is arrogant

526
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,790
and straightforward.

527
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,790
Please don't be mad at him.

528
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,920
I will persuade him.

529
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,710
Have a seat.

530
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,350
I didn't expect

531
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,100
that he would play this game.

532
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,660
He just told me

533
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,310
he thought it was a dream.

534
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,310
So, Ruan,

535
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,300
can you take this job?

536
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,910
We'll talk about it after meeting him.

537
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,420
Hello?

538
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,270
Mr. Zhang.

539
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
I see.

540
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,090
Okay, go ahead.

541
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Could it be him?

542
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,230
Who?

543
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,300
A very unique young director.

544
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,180
Zhang Yiqing.

545
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,500
He has directed many art films and has won many awards.

546
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,360
Let me tell you.

547
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,660
Capital is capital. Creation is creation.

548
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,590
Don't interfere with my creation.

549
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Bye.

550
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,470
Sorry.

551
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Director Zhang.

552
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,670
This is Ruan Lanzhu.

553
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Ling Jiushi.

554
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,100
I told you before.

555
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,740
They led me

556
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,150
to pass the door before.

557
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,500
They are very reliable in the circle.

558
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,750
It's hard to meet them.

559
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,750
Zaozao.

560
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,670
I've thought

561
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,350
about this.

562
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,900
I need to

563
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,580
think about it twice.

564
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,670
Nice tea.

565
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,500
No, Director Zhang.

566
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,740
Your next door is about to open.

567
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,660
Now, if you...

568
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,230
You are good-looking young men.

569
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,350
You can contact me

570
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,060
if you want to be an actor.

571
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
To be honest,

572
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,940
other organizations have contacted me.

573
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
White Deer.

574
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
Oh?

575
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,320
Let's go.

576
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,730
You've known that.

577
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Ruan.

578
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,830
Lingling.

579
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,940
Are we leaving like this?

580
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,950
Or what?

581
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,050
Do you want an autograph or a photo?

582
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,120
Li Dongyuan did it?

583
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,420
Who else could it be?

584
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,520
He did it to take revenge on you

585
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,220
for Baijie.

586
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,510
Anyway, it is quite difficult to deal with him.

587
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,630
It would be troublesome if we screwed up.

588
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,630
Leave it to him.

589
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,910
Perfect.

590
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,860
You're right.

591
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,910
He's quite arrogant.

592
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,820
Did you leave the clue to him on purpose?

593
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,910
You really did that?

594
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
Why?

595
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,360
Li Dongyuan called me last night.

596
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
So I told him

597
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,620
as compensation for him.

598
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,270
Besides, I don't want to be a bad guy like Mou Kai.

599
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,830
You're right.

600
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,660
But why should we come here so early?

601
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,860
We didn't sleep well.

602
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,520
This long journey was costly.

603
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,390
After all, he's a friend of Tan Zaozao.

604
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,510
I have to respect her.

605
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,570
But since he didn't choose Obsidian,

606
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,230
it has nothing to do with me.

607
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,190
I have money for gasoline.

608
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,790
How did White Deer persuade Zhang Yiqing?

609
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,580
Think about Li Dongyuan.

610
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,750
Think about his skills to persuade.

611
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
It makes sense.
