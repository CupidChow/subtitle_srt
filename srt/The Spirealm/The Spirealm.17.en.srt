(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,990
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,900
(Tao Zaozao)

4
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,470
Hello?

5
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,110
Lingling, is Ruan here?

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,990
Why didn't you call him directly?

7
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,030
I'm afraid.

8
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,310
What?

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,910
What are you afraid of?

10
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,710
Aren't you afraid of Ruan?

11
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,950
I...

12
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,130
Not really.

13
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,630
You're really someone.

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,310
Please persuade him

15
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,310
and let's have a meal together next time.

16
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,910
Bye.

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,030
Hello?

18
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,710
Manman.

19
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,110
Manman.

20
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,190
Did you call me?

21
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,030
What's wrong?

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Are you sick?

23
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,510
I

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,070
No, I'm fine.

25
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm going upstairs.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270
Chen.

27
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,990
What happened?

28
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,680
This is a process that many players must experience.

29
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,990
Is it a must?

30
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,430
Basically,

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,390
everyone will be depressed for a while.

32
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,110
It often happens

33
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,110
between the second and third doors.

34
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,730
Just hang in there.

35
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,710
But he'll be dead if he can't make it.

36
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,110
Why haven't I experienced that?

37
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,320
Maybe because you have strong nerves.

38
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,390
I've only seen two people who have no reaction

39
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,390
to the door.

40
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,110
One is you.

41
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,750
The other is Ruan Lanzhu?

42
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,490
The other is Cheng Qianli.

43
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,710
We've talked about this.

44
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,680
We thought he was...

45
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,470
So,

46
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,770
he might not understand what happened inside the door.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,829
Has Ruan Lanzhu ever been depressed?

48
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,829
Probably.

49
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,680
But he won't tell us.

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,360
We were not with him,

51
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,230
so we didn't know the details.

52
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,310
But a long time ago, an old hand

53
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,350
mentioned this.

54
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,910
Where is the old hand?

55
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,190
He died.

56
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,240
He died when passing the ninth door with Ruan.

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,390
Hey, you two.

58
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,400
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,230
Talking about how dangerous this door is.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,390
That's true.

61
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,210
The door is really dangerous.

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,100
But I think

63
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,920
we should have hotpot tonight.

64
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
What?

65
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,990
What does it have to do with having hotpot?

66
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,990
You don't want it?

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,230
Let's go for groceries then.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
Sure.

69
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,510
I'll write down what I want to eat

70
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,909
in case I forget it later.

71
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,390
See you later.

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,470
(Wu Qi)

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,740
It's been a while, Dog Qi.

74
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,810
You know it's been a while.

75
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,390
Why don't you contact me?

76
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,350
You're heartless.

77
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,990
Let's have dinner together tonight.

78
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,520
We'll have hotpot tonight.

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,470
Do you want to join us?

80
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,110
Sure.

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,830
Anything I need to bring?

82
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,750
Bring your mouth with you.

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,910
That's great.

84
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,390
Okay, see you later.

85
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,070
Qianli.

86
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,150
My friend is here.

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,190
Please open the door for him.

88
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,190
Okay.

89
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,830
Coming.

90
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,870
Wash this please.

91
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,000
Have a seat.

92
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,750
It'll be ready soon.

93
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,310
Dog Qi.

94
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,350
Hmph.

95
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,880
I brought you some wine.

96
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,310
Thank you.

97
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,150
Have a seat.

98
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,850
The dishes will be ready soon.

99
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
Almost done.

100
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,670
Okay, take it there.

101
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,670
Okay.

102
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,790
Where is Ruan Lanzhu?

103
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,560
He's still upstairs.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,550
I'll ask him to come down.

105
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,340
He should be upstairs.

106
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,600
I didn't see him go out.

107
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,990
Come here.

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,190
Time to eat.

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,550
I made it for you.

110
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,750
Not too much chili.

111
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,590
It's a double-flavoured pot. Choose the side you like.

112
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,590
Thank you.

113
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,950
Dog Qi, what are you doing?

114
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,150
Let's eat.

115
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,710
Why is he so handsome?

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,230
He's like a star.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,350
You can't even shut up while eating.

118
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,350
Eat up.

119
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,390
By the way,

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,190
have you been following the game news lately?

121
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,450
There's nothing here.

122
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,710
Let me tell you secretly.

123
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,350
Recently,

124
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,510
the Spi Realm

125
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
has gone viral again.

126
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,400
Many people are playing it.

127
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,430
It's in line with what is happening abroad.

128
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,270
Many people have been insane.

129
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,390
You should be good.

130
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,390
Stop playing it.

131
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,870
I quited long ago.

132
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,390
But you are playing something else.

133
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,850
Something more exciting.

134
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,510
It's fine.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
A few days ago,

136
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,740
Tian wanted to play.

137
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,310
I forbade her.

138
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,990
You forbade her?

139
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,230
Of course.

140
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,550
I can be obedient to her

141
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,980
because I love her.

142
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,470
But she needs to listen to me, the breadwinner,

143
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,870
when it comes to major issues of principle.

144
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,110
It's good to spend less time on games.

145
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,870
It'll be too late if she gets addicted to online games.

146
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,350
It does no good

147
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,190
if she spends money on equipment.

148
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,470
You're right.

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,550
The game operators nowadays

150
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,720
are immoral.

151
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,310
Exactly.

152
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,270
All right, I'm full.

153
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,990
Thank you for your hospitality.

154
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,950
Manman prepared some fruit.

155
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,990
Have some.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sure.

157
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,910
Manman.

158
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,510
Manman.

159
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,590
Fruit.

160
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,630
I forgot.

161
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,830
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,670
It's okay.

163
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,510
It's okay.

164
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,920
Tian is waiting for me at home.

165
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,670
I should go now.

166
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,270
I may take some drinks and have them on my way home.

167
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,270
Okay.

168
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,860
Enjoy your meal. I'm leaving.

169
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,350
See you next time.

170
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,070
I'll see you off.

171
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,070
Sure.

172
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:45,750
Go.

173
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,190
Bye.

174
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,190
Bye.

175
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
Let's go.

176
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,670
Let's play cards.

177
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,830
Dou Dizhu.

178
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,320
Who do you think was so immoral

179
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,780
that made the game public?

180
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,510
Xiong Qi?

181
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,390
Yes.

182
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,470
They said before

183
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,710
they wanted to do something in the game.

184
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,870
Later I went to their building

185
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,390
and saw a lot of hard disks,

186
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,270
which were exactly the same as the one I received.

187
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,200
Maybe they are really the culprit.

188
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
I'm worried

189
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,870
that Wu Qi and his girfriend are playing it.

190
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,190
You can't stop it.

191
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,390
I know.

192
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,350
So we need to clear the stage as soon as possible

193
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,630
and find out the rule.

194
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,430
Don't worry.

195
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,830
We need to be the master of this game as soon as possible.

196
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,690
Only in this way

197
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,510
can you help him better

198
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,110
if he really plays this game.

199
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,110
Rocket!

200
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,990
Let me go.

201
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,030
Yuan.

202
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,590
Who is Yuan?

203
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,490
Please have some milk.

204
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670
No.

205
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,310
Suit yourself.

206
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,030
I'm going to pack my luggage.

207
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,350
Why are you laughing?

208
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,190
Don't you feel guilty

209
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,590
to bully a cute boy like me?

210
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm not laughing.

211
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,190
Then why are you smiling?

212
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,790
I'm watching some funny videos.

213
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,910
Don't think I can forgive you

214
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,040
even if you introduced me a big client.

215
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,320
Stop it. You've got a good deal.

216
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,550
The price Zhang Yiqing gave White Deer

217
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,680
is at least doubled.

218
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,970
Now that they are in place,

219
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,120
you have to clear your grudges.

220
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,640
What about the commission?

221
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,550
It's better to make friends than make enemies.

222
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,990
I'm here today to tell you

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,110
I'll forgive you.

224
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,430
It's a small gift.

225
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,510
Let me know if something good like this happens.

226
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,690
Just don't cause any trouble.

227
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,510
Don't worry. I got it.

228
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,550
There are many fake clues recently.

229
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,390
Be careful.

230
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,590
I've been fabricating fake clues for years.

231
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,850
I'm not afraid of that.

232
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,110
Time to pass the door.

233
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,370
May I borrow your door?

234
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,450
Is it Zhang Yiqing's door?

235
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,550
Yes.

236
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,790
I have a bad feeling.

237
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,550
It's okay. It won't take long. Just 15 minutes.

238
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,470
I'll go find Chen Fei.

239
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,030
Morning, Ruan.

240
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,520
Morning, Lingling.

241
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,790
Morning.

242
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,110
Look at you.

243
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,860
Did you binge-watch

244
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,320
horror videos last night?

245
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,510
Not horror videos.

246
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,870
But I did binge-watch a drama

247
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,350
called

248
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,090
"The Runaway Princess of the Overbearing Prince."

249
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,320
Have you heard of it?

250
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,990
Qianli.

251
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,470
Don't watch it all day.

252
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,550
What if you become more stupid after watching these boring series?

253
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,550
Really?

254
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,750
Yes.

255
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
What is that?

256
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,230
It's a gift from Li Dongyuan to Ruan.

257
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,990
From Li Dongyuan?

258
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,390
Yes.

259
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,770
(Award)

260
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,550
What?

261
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,110
One yuan for purchase.

262
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,550
(Zhang Yiqing has entered the door.)

263
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,630
He's up to no good.

264
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:30,440
(The Boss of White Deer entered the door through us.)

265
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,830
Calm down.

266
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,110
Yes, take it easy.

267
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,470
Okay, that's all then.

268
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,040
It's a call from the White Bear.

269
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,600
They were almost killed by fake clues.

270
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,970
Li Dongyuan has entered the door.

271
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,500
I'm afraid something might happen.

272
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,590
Take care of it.

273
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,710
You've changed.

274
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,790
You're caring now.

275
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,110
Didn't I

276
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,790
care about you?

277
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,310
Is it because of Ling Jiushi?

278
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,750
By the way,

279
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,570
have you picked him?

280
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,750
Yes.

281
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,320
I know you think highly of Yi Manman,

282
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,780
but for me, he's boring.

283
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,350
Passing the door doesn't

284
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,160
need to be interesting.

285
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,510
Hurry up.

286
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,390
This way.

287
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,750
Why me again?

288
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,910
Isn't this a low-class door?

289
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,430
Let's pass it first.

290
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,670
Help me.

291
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,230
Help!

292
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,750
Are you trying to kill me?

293
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,710
How would I know the clue is fake?

294
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,150
Go!

295
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,030
Wait for me. Wait for me.

296
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,430
Lingling, you are so kind.

297
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,910
You're even worried about Li Dongyuan.

298
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,550
They've been in the door for 15 minutes

299
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,950
but still don't come out.

300
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,440
Isn't Li Dongyuan a friend?

301
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,000
Friend?

302
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,790
I've heard this word

303
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,310
a lot

304
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,510
since you joined us.

305
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,150
The clue is fake.

306
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,730
Take him to my room.

307
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,720
I'll get the medical kit.

308
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,070
Be careful.

309
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,360
(Tao Zaozao)

310
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,680
Hello?

311
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,480
Lingling,

312
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Zhang Yiqing is seriously injured.

313
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,800
He's in emergency treatment.

314
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
He almost died in the door.

315
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,670
This is his second door.

316
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,200
It should be easy.

317
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,830
I know. White Deer's men are injured, too.

318
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,480
Zhang Yiqing offended Ruan.

319
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,840
Can you help me persuade Ruan?

320
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Me?

321
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,640
I know Ruan's temper.

322
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,480
Others cannot calm him down.

323
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,520
But you are different.

324
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,320
Am I?

325
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,800
Don't you realize it?

326
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,720
He is nice.

327
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
You didn't even treat him like an elder brother.

328
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,560
I want to,

329
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,880
but I'm older than him.

330
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,280
Or should I take him as a younger brother?

331
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,920
Anyway, Lingling, please help me.

332
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,000
Please.

333
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,839
Then I...

334
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,760
I'll try it.

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,640
I'll think about how to persuade him.

336
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,359
Please, Lingling.

337
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Okay.

338
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,210
How about Li Dongyuan?

339
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,480
He's okay now.

340
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,109
He's asleep.

341
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,720
Zhuang Rujiao will pick him up tomorrow.

342
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
There were too many fake clues lately.

343
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,250
I suspect it has something to do with Xiong Qi.

344
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
Li Dongyuan is severely injured.

345
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
So must Zhang Yiqing be.

346
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,790
Tan Zaozao told you so?

347
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Yes.

348
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,980
She wants me to make you calm down.

349
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,170
What are you going to do?

350
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I...

351
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,110
What do you mean?

352
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
You need to show your sincerity.

353
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,040
I'll ask her to treat you to a big meal.

354
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,320
What would you like?

355
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,880
Tell me what you want to eat.

356
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,480
Let me help you.

357
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,160
Lingling.

358
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,520
No need. I can do it myself.

359
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,650
Where are you going?

360
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
My next door will open after the Spring Festival.

361
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,720
I want to take this chance

362
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,480
to spend time with my family.

363
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,400
Say hello to your family for me.

364
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Thank you.

365
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
Boss, see you next year.

366
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,170
Happy New Year.

367
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Thank you.

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,960
The new year is coming so soon.

369
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Are you going to pack up?

370
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,040
Pack up? Why?

371
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
Go home for the Spring Festival.

372
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,920
I...

373
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
I have no family.

374
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
I'll stay here.

375
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
What about you?

376
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,070
Same as you.

377
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,570
Aren't you going back?

378
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I don't have many relatives at home.

379
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,840
Yixie and Qianli will go back as well, right?

380
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,720
(Happy New Year)

381
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
You two are procrastinators.

382
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,800
You are not going back until New Year's Eve.

383
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
To be honest, I don't want to go back.

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,110
It's so annoying to face so many relatives.

385
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,440
I just want to stay here.

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
See you next year.

387
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,080
Thank you for taking care of me this year.

388
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,440
See you next year.

389
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,970
I'll send you a red envelope

390
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,600
if you are the first to pay New Year greetings tomorrow.

391
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Okay, Ruan.

392
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,590
Keep your promise.

393
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,490
Let's go.

394
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Bye.

395
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
Do you like fish?

396
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,110
Anything is okay for me,

397
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,710
as long as it's cooked by you.

398
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Manman, do you like fish?

399
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Braised or spicy?

400
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Sashimi.

401
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Fresh sashimi.

402
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Okay.

403
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,520
Why do they come back?

404
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,580
Happy New Year.

405
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Happy New Year.

406
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Come in.

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Happy New Year.

408
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Come in.

409
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Thank you.

410
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Thank you, Lingling.

411
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,710
Ruan, I'm sorry.

412
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Why?

413
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
Just say it.

414
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,530
It's New Year's Eve.

415
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,010
I don't want outsiders to eat here.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Mr. Ruan,

417
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
previously,

418
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,260
I was a bit rude in my words.

419
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,360
Please forgive me.

420
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,760
Didn't you ask for the White Deer's help?

421
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,960
Why did you come here?

422
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,880
People of the White Deer are unreliable.

423
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,760
The clues they gave are all fake.

424
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I...

425
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,600
Please

426
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,680
forgive my reckless behaviors.

427
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
You know,

428
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,780
I will enter the next door soon.

429
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
So,

430
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,560
could you please help me?

431
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,640
Ruan, please help Zhang.

432
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,320
He didn't mean it.

433
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
I won't help him.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,200
But I can recommend someone else to you.

435
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Someone else?

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,460
But I'll remind you first.

437
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
That person is your fan.

438
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
A crazy fan.

439
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,720
If you're okay with it,

440
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,080
I'll give you her number.

441
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Okay.

442
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
All right.

443
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,150
If there's nothing else,

444
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
you can leave now.

445
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,290
Ruan, can't you let us stay for dinner?

446
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
It smells so good.

447
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,140
It's a family banquet.

448
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,920
Well, it's inconvenient.

449
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,920
We'll leave now.

450
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,940
We won't disturb you then.

451
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Let's go.

452
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,830
By the way, thank you again, Mr. Ruan.

453
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Bye.

454
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
Go.

455
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Thanks.

456
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
For what?

457
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,470
It's Tan Zaozao who should thank me.

458
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,360
You decided to help her for my sake, didn't you?

459
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
It's my duty. You're welcome.

460
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,640
We've prepared some dumplings.

461
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,870
Cabbage stuffing and leek stuffing,

462
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,070
which one do you like?

463
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Leek, please.

464
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Okay.

465
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Can I ask you something?

466
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Go ahead.

467
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,700
How did you get into the Spi Realm?

468
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,890
Just a coincidence.

469
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
It was a coincidence.

470
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
But I believe there was something inevitable.

471
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Then...

472
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,260
Why are you so awesome?

473
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,200
I can see what others can't.

474
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,350
Like the light in you.

475
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Light?

476
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,740
We can turn off the lamplight,

477
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,000
but your light won't vanish.

478
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,280
Not everyone can stay as calm as you

479
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
when facing the danger of death.

480
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
One minute left.

481
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,680
The new year is about to come.

482
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,840
Will someone enter the doors during the Spring Festival?

483
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,640
Will it stop the coming of death?

484
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,360
Death may come at any time.

485
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,890
As long as I'm alive,

486
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
nothing matters.

487
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,440
Happy New Year.

488
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Happy New Year.

489
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,140
In this desolate world

490
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,940
You won't be there

491
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,190
No one can escape the destined game of separation

492
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,840
This ridiculous fate

493
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,510
Only you are willing to

494
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,960
Why did you bring back so much stuff?

495
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
You know what?

496
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,040
My brother forced me to bring

497
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,680
5 kilograms of meat here.

498
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
I asked him to send it over.

499
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,320
But he said it was different.

500
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,840
What's the difference?

501
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,440
Does it taste more delicious with my sweat?

502
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Don't be so disgusting.

503
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Disgusting?

504
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Then don't eat it.

505
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
I have to eat it all.

506
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,340
Why do you still want to eat it?

507
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,550
It's almost time for Yi Manman to enter the door.

508
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,950
Do you want to follow him?

509
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,360
You go with him.

510
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,220
He's not in a good state recently.

511
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Take care of him.

512
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,620
I'll open the door.

513
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,080
You're here.

514
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Come on.

515
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,580
Here comes the superstar.

516
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,370
Come on, have a seat.

517
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,610
I'm going to the toilet. You guys talk.

518
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,640
Ruan,

519
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,940
the lady you introduced to us is so interesting.

520
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
She's not only a fan of Zhang Yiqing,

521
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,440
but a die-hard fan.

522
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,120
As soon as he arrived,

523
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
she took him

524
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,360
to watch his movies together.

525
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,320
How awkward!

526
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,840
It wasn't the end.

527
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,620
She took out a notebook

528
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
full of

529
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
reviews of Zhang Yiqing's movies

530
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,960
with at least 70,000 or 80,000 words.

531
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,960
I've never seen Zhang Yiqing

532
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,880
with such a lame expression.

533
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,470
It was hilarious.

534
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,890
How was it going in the door?

535
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Not bad.

536
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,870
Ruan,

537
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,200
the lady you introduced is very reliable.

538
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,880
Is this what you want to say?

539
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,350
Ruan,

540
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,820
didn't you tell Lingling that

541
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,750
I'm going to enter the third door?

542
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,750
I don't know.

543
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Tan Zaozao,

544
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,880
let me make this clear.

545
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,130
This is your third door.

546
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,480
The Obsidian never helps others through the sixth door.

547
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,880
If you want to stay alive,

548
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,360
you have to make more practice on your own.

549
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Ruan, you...

550
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,760
Can't you make an exception?

551
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
No.

552
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,040
The further it goes, the harder it is.

553
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
I can't even get out of it myself,

554
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,240
let alone help others.

555
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Ling Jiushi,

556
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,170
you also have to practice more.

557
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,680
Okay.

558
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,810
Get yourself ready.

559
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Isn't he going?

560
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Me?

561
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,120
Take the time to go to the toilet.

562
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,380
The door is coming.

563
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
What's the clue?

564
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,300
Waverly Hill Sanatorium.

565
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,560
I've got prepared for it.

566
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,870
Waverly Hill Sanatorium.

567
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Xiong Qi?

568
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Xiong.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,390
Bro, have you made up your mind?

570
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,320
Xiong, I'm about to enter the door.

571
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,320
Can we talk about it later?

572
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Is it also Waverly Hill Sanatorium?

573
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Haha.

574
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,680
Bro, I like you more and more.

575
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,260
You are secretive.

576
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
We'll be a group sooner or later.

577
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,830
But not yet.

578
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,040
I understand you.

579
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,590
We have a girl,

580
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
who will also enter this door later.

581
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,720
To show my sincerity,

582
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,280
I'll tell her later

583
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,400
to not fight for the clue.

584
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
You can try to get it.

585
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,560
Remember,

586
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
her name is Mengmeng.

587
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,920
You can take care of each other in the door.

588
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,190
It's inappropriate for Mengmeng to give up looking for any clues.

589
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,360
It's a deal.

590
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Xiong.

591
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Xia.

592
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,720
Hug me.

593
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Go away.

594
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,680
It's a friend's party. I drank a little.

595
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,400
We're going to enter the door soon.

596
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,800
Do you still have the mood to join the party?

597
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Don't worry.

598
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,840
I know everything

599
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,240
about Waverly Hill Sanatorium.

600
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
It's easy.

601
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,880
It's a door that requires physical strength.

602
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,280
Few people share information about this door on the forum.

603
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
So,

604
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,440
we need to join more parties

605
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,840
and make more friends.

606
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,040
Then things will be easier.

607
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
There used to be

608
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
a Russian

609
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,640
who passed it soon.

610
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,450
I spent a lot of money to get some information.

611
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,920
I know

612
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,360
there are many secrets

613
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,120
in Room 502.

614
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,240
What's more,

615
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,880
the key is to find the director.

616
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,830
He always hides well,

617
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,870
but it's easy for me

618
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
to get him.

619
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,260
Mengmeng will go into the door

620
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,110
with you.

621
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,080
Did I hear it right?

622
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Mengmeng?

623
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,480
Mengmeng is Xiong Qi's weakness.

624
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,400
As long as you can kill her

625
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,240
and frame the Obsidian,

626
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,360
we can kill two birds with one stone.

627
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,910
Xia, you are truly despicable.

628
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,640
Xia, you are truly despicable.

629
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,230
If Mengmeng died,

630
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,850
Xiong Qi will definitely not let Obsidian off the hook.

631
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,440
By then, with them fighting,

632
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,120
we will benefit.

633
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,640
Wishing you swift success.

634
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
Don't be like this.

635
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Go away.

636
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,560
The Waverly Hill Sanatorium,

637
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,990
located in Kentucky in America,

638
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,280
is historically significant.

639
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,720
Established in 1910,

640
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,080
it was created to address

641
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
the severe outbreak of tuberculosis at that time.

642
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,680
However, it is said that over 8000 patients have unfortunately passed away

643
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,840
within its walls.

644
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,460
One of the most bizarre incidents

645
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,640
is the death of a female nurse

646
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,440
who reportedly committed suicide by jumping from Room 502.

647
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,720
She was pregnant when she died,

648
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,200
but no one knew who the child belonged to.

649
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,830
Room 502 is a key point.

650
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Note it down.

651
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Anything else?

652
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I

653
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,639
don't know.

654
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
My eyes hurt from staring at the computer for too long.

655
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,960
Later, a patient managed to escape from the Waverly Hill Sanatorium

656
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,159
through a tunnel,

657
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,280
which should be where the door is located.

658
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,280
A Russian man on a forum

659
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
shared information about this door.

660
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,000
I found him

661
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,210
and we had arranged to meet.

662
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,179
Strangely, I can't seem to contact him anymore.

663
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
It's a bit eerie.

664
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,560
Could it be that he failed to enter the door suddenly?

665
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,290
My intuition told me

666
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,179
that it wasn't as straightforward as it seemed.

667
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,800
Let's go.

668
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Coming.

669
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,720
Wait for me.

670
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,540
Someone over there is looking at you.

671
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,720
I always attract attention wherever I go.

672
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Hi.

673
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,040
Has anyone ever told you that you look like Tan Zaozao,

674
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,370
that female celebrity?

675
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
No.

676
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,360
She's a superstar and so beautiful.

677
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I'm far from that.

678
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,920
Oh,

679
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,220
it was my mistake then.

680
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,540
Let me introduce myself. I'm Jiang Yingrui.

681
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,490
This is my seventh time entering the door.

682
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,000
And you are?

683
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,310
Sorry, you're late.

684
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,080
We've already formed a team.

685
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,720
There are all sorts of people inside the door.

686
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,360
Some guys like to pick up girls,

687
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,880
especially acting as flower protectors.

688
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
I'm sorry.

689
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,030
I'm the flower.

690
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,320
I'm in his team.

691
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Good.

692
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,470
Girl,

693
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,600
pretty boys won't be reliable inside the door.

694
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,200
You'll need someone like me.

695
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,420
I've entered the door five times.

696
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,120
I can surely protect you well

697
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,320
especially at night.

698
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
Hello, I'm Zhu Meng.

699
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,750
This is my fifth time entering  the door.

700
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,640
Let's each take care of ourselves.

701
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
Zhu Meng,

702
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,440
do you think that girl might be Mengmeng?

703
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,040
I'm Mengmeng.

704
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,720
Xiong Qi has already told me before.

705
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,430
Although we are not together now,

706
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,560
I dislike him more.

707
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,010
Don't feel pressured.

708
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,070
Let me know if anything comes up.

709
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,070
OK.

710
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,400
She seemed quite special.

711
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm special too,

712
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,110
especially beautiful.

713
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,650
Please follow me to the fourth floor.

714
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,720
Your treatment will begin seven days later

715
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,800
when the doctors arrive.

716
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,230
Before that,

717
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,330
I hope you familiarize yourselves with the facilities in the psychiatric hospital.

718
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,520
You'll like this place.

719
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,410
There are some rules in the psychiatric hospital

720
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,080
that everyone must adhere to.

721
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
For example,

722
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,000
meals should only be eaten in the canteen,

723
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,240
and eating food brought from outside is also not allowed.

724
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,280
Don't come out

725
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,280
after 8 P.M. every night.

726
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,480
Some patients here

727
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,530
may not be in good mental state,

728
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,240
so please be cautious.

729
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,640
As for the wards,

730
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,310
you are free to arrange them as you wish

731
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,640
on the fourth floor.

732
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,720
Just be sure

733
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
never

734
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,440
to touch this red alarm device.
