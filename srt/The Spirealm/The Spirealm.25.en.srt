00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:27,450
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,039
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,430
Why are you all sleeping

4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,710
like Ruan Lanzhu?

5
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,310
I wonder how his injury is.

6
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,470
You should sleep too.

7
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,470
So

8
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,910
the doll's cry was not because of the room.

9
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,750
Baby boy,

10
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,270
please don't cry.

11
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,670
Read it 3 times

12
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,270
and sleep tight.

13
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,590
Are you serious?

14
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,430
What was going on?

15
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,390
Of course it's true. How can I lie to you?

16
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,070
Didn't you sense the danger last night?

17
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,030
I didn't wake up.

18
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,480
That's impossible.

19
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,030
Of course you didn't wake up.

20
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,240
She came and left.

21
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,990
She came again and then left.

22
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,230
But you still didn't wake up.

23
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,710
That wasn't supposed to happen.

24
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,670
I've always been alert.

25
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,270
But what was she looking at?

26
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,530
She was checking if we slept well?

27
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,190
Mrs. Yu

28
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,030
brought a few piggies.

29
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,030
They checked

30
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,950
the room we moved out last night.

31
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,030
But they didn't go in.

32
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,920
Then they went around

33
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,030
to the southeast room

34
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,810
and peeped at the door for a long time.

35
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,760
Like something was triggered,

36
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,070
they rushed in.

37
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,110
But I don't know

38
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,510
what the specific condition is.

39
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,820
A few piggies.

40
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,510
Was it related to offering sacrifice to the River God?

41
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,510
Yes.

42
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,670
I've heard of a vengeful ghost.

43
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,630
I've never heard of

44
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,670
piggies who get killed wrongfully.

45
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,670
So scary.

46
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,030
Did they come in?

47
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,290
Don't you understand?

48
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,470
They went to the other room.

49
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,310
They went to the room we left last night.

50
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,270
So, this hole is...

51
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,110
Mrs. Yu watched you sleep

52
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,310
through the hole last night.

53
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,630
She watched me sleep all night.

54
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,630
Yes.

55
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,230
The NPC in this game

56
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,330
is indeed a little different.

57
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,470
The point is

58
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,390
we almost died last night.

59
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,430
Should we

60
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,590
sleep in another room tonight?

61
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,590
No need.

62
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,630
Just keep an eye on the situation

63
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,830
and find other clues.

64
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,020
Two people are missing.

65
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Yes.

66
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,710
They are dead.

67
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,830
They died.

68
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,830
Some people died yesterday?

69
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,070
I didn't hear anything.

70
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,270
In that room.

71
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
They died.

72
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,630
People died

73
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,330
on the first night.

74
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,230
This is so scary.

75
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,789
We are really lucky.

76
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,429
Why?

77
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,630
You can't read the eyes.

78
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,630
Go find clues.

79
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,590
Wait.

80
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,770
I haven't eaten anything yet.

81
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,110
Not even a bite?

82
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,870
Are you really not hungry?

83
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,430
You are coming.

84
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,350
Did you notice anything

85
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,030
last night?

86
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,950
We slept till morning.

87
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,470
Only he saw it.

88
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,150
What did you see?

89
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,270
I saw it.

90
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,190
I saw

91
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,350
some piggies were looking in

92
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,840
through the window.

93
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,870
I don't know

94
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,160
whether they came in or killed anyone.

95
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,590
Mrs. Yu was also outside.

96
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,910
I really don't know

97
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,190
what she did.

98
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,470
So you mean that the piggies killed them

99
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,150
and Mrs. Yu was the lookout?

100
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,070
Piggies killed them?

101
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,310
Is that possible?

102
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,630
Anything's possible

103
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,870
in the door.

104
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,110
Last night,

105
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,310
I heard a baby crying.

106
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,470
It's from your room.

107
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,870
Be careful tonight.

108
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,390
I heard it too.

109
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,370
But it's from outside.

110
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,830
Let's go in first,

111
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
and check this room.

112
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,670
There's a hole here.

113
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,510
It reminds me of the incense that knocks people out in martial arts drama.

114
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,970
There's no incense smell.

115
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,930
I was just kidding.

116
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,970
It seems that you are not a master.

117
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,150
What, I...

118
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,310
The oil lamp is still full.

119
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,590
The oil lamp is full?

120
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,800
They didn't light the lamp.

121
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,110
It seems that we have to

122
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,670
listen to the NPC.

123
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,170
What about the bodies?

124
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,270
There should be bodies if they died.

125
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,790
Could they be eaten by the piggies?

126
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,150
Piggies ate humans?

127
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,510
What's wrong?

128
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,350
Pigsy even ate people in the Yunzhai Cave.

129
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,270
Let's go.

130
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,670
Everyone.

131
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,550
In a place like this,

132
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,870
it's normal that the bodies disappeared.

133
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,270
Maybe they were disposed of.

134
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,030
There is no other clue here.

135
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,030
Please leave.

136
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,000
What should we do next?

137
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,270
Let's go down and see

138
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,310
if there are any other clues.

139
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,030
You look

140
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,670
really like him.

141
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,030
I think so.

142
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,510
But I'm more handsome than him.

143
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,470
Who is it?

144
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,190
It's blood.

145
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,950
It's the same as those rooms.

146
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,030
There are drag marks.

147
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,160
It seems that the bodies

148
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,670
might be hiding here.

149
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,750
So they were killed by Mrs. Yu

150
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,590
or the piggies?

151
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,890
There are no piggies here.

152
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,030
How about

153
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,130
following the trail of blood?

154
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,800
You've become smarter.

155
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,550
The scene

156
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,070
may be very bloody.

157
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,670
Be prepared.

158
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,750
Wait. Wait.

159
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
No, no, no.

160
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,030
It's too creepy.

161
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,350
I'm not going.

162
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,470
Since we're here,

163
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,830
let's go inside.

164
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,950
I'll go in first.

165
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,950
Follow me.

166
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,590
It's empty.

167
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,270
No way.

168
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,990
The door just appeared.

169
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,150
It really insults my intelligence.

170
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
It's the door.

171
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,410
Someone's here. Let's go.

172
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,110
Be good.

173
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,670
Don't cry.

174
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,470
Baby, be good.

175
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,230
Be good.

176
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,270
Is she crazy?

177
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,030
Don't cry. Listen to mama.

178
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,630
Oh no. Leave.

179
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,830
Be good. Don't cry.

180
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,660
Be good.

181
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,100
Good thing we're fast.

182
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,590
So scary.

183
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,010
The oil lamp we used

184
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,230
was made from human oil.

185
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,829
Is Mrs. Yu crazy?

186
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,550
There's nothing in her arms.

187
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,230
But luckily,

188
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,470
Lingling, we find the door, right?

189
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,829
If we find the key,

190
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,550
we can go out.

191
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,829
Meng Yu.

192
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,599
You brought up the rear.

193
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,079
Why were you so nice to me for no reason?

194
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,880
The last person who treated me like this was Zhu Meng.

195
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,230
You want to be like him

196
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,670
and ask me to join you?

197
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,850
Let me tell you.

198
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,750
I've joined a team.

199
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,960
I really can't join White Deer.

200
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,640
Don't you think about it?

201
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,790
White Deer is as good as Obsidian.

202
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,270
You don't have to make a decision now.

203
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,670
But just now...

204
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,230
Thank you.

205
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,510
We're brothers. Don't say that.

206
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,430
Wait, you two.

207
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,790
What we just saw was making oil with humans.

208
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,430
Alright, I know. Be quiet.

209
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,630
Now we knew it.

210
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,310
The human oil lamp is a taboo condition.

211
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,870
But that's not the point.

212
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,590
The point is

213
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,590
there's nothing in Mrs. Yu's arms.

214
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,110
Where is the baby?

215
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,630
The key

216
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,610
is to find the baby.

217
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,670
Let's go back first.

218
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,830
Let's ask if they have any other clues

219
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,440
when we eat.

220
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,150
We found the door.

221
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,290
Don't tell anyone.

222
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,670
Especially you.

223
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,990
Okay.

224
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,460
There's nothing in the ancestral hall?

225
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,470
I think there is.

226
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,670
It's just that I haven't noticed it yet.

227
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,630
I don't want to go in anymore.

228
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,750
There's a weird energy in here.

229
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,670
It's so scary.

230
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,670
I have to go in later.

231
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,150
Wait for me outside.

232
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,150
Let's go.

233
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,390
What did you hear?

234
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,110
Just a little.

235
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,230
They said there's an ancestral hall over there.

236
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,430
Let's go there later.

237
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,060
(Ancestral Hall)

238
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,430
Why didn't he stop us?

239
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,360
He allowed us to come

240
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,230
to such an important place easily.

241
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,890
Did we come to the wrong place?

242
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,470
Didn't you say

243
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,670
they didn't find anything

244
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,790
here?

245
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,200
You need to find something with your own eyes.

246
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,790
Let's go.

247
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,950
(Blessings and Longevity)

248
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,720
This ancestral hall is not right.

249
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,310
Why?

250
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,250
There are some memorial tablets over there.

251
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,510
Look at these memorial tablets.

252
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,110
What's wrong?

253
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,160
The dates are not right.

254
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,250
A one-year-old child.

255
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,870
He died at the age of 1.

256
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,110
The tablet of a child who dies young

257
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,040
can't be put in the ancestral hall.

258
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,350
Is it wind?

259
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,630
It's wind, right?

260
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,550
I think you are crazy.

261
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,600
(Memorial Tablet of Yu Caizhe)

262
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,070
Look.

263
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,510
Tablets in these rows all belong to kids.

264
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,910
The oldest one is less than three years old.

265
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,190
The youngest one only lived less than a year.

266
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,190
Different years,

267
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,480
but the same death date.

268
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,510
Abnormal death,

269
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,990
right?

270
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,070
They all died

271
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,550
on the River God Festival.

272
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,670
Exactly.

273
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,390
Sacrifice made them die young.

274
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,310
They were sacrificed to the River God,

275
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,350
which was a contribution to their family,

276
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,750
so their tablets are in the ancestral hall.

277
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,310
What if these kids

278
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,610
were not sacrificed to the River God,

279
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,710
or

280
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,310
what if there is no River God,

281
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,660
and it's just a made-up character?

282
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,110
Then these kids

283
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,240
might have been trafficked

284
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,510
or murdered.

285
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,070
Traffic in children?

286
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,750
If we can find

287
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,830
the kids that will be sacrificed on the coming River God Festival,

288
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,390
everything will be clear.

289
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,990
Yes.

290
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Let's go.

291
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,910
Did you find any new clues?

292
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,020
We...

293
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,190
We found nothing.

294
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,810
Nothing was found,

295
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,400
let alone new clues.

296
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,790
How dare you steal from us!

297
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,950
Why are you here again?

298
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,470
I didn't steal anything.

299
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,110
You little beggar,

300
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,810
do you know what this place is?

301
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,190
How dare you come here?

302
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,190
I'll...

303
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,030
Are you okay?

304
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,950
Sir, it's you.

305
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,310
You little beggar,

306
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,550
if you dare come here again,

307
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,390
I'll teach you a lesson.

308
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,590
Why are you so fierce?

309
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,310
You bullied a blind kid.

310
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,430
He's a beggar

311
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,940
and a thief.

312
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,430
I should teach him a lesson!

313
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,880
Did you steal again?

314
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,310
No.

315
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,990
If I hadn't been starving last time,

316
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,430
I wouldn't have stolen anything.

317
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,630
Did he steal from you?

318
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,950
No.

319
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,830
Then why were you so fierce?

320
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,790
No one can bully him.

321
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,870
Madam said

322
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,800
it's the River God Festival...

323
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,070
You saw it.

324
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,270
I didn't do anything.

325
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,920
It has nothing to do with me.

326
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,350
The symptom looks familiar.

327
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,160
Is he suffering from epilepsy?

328
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,390
Don't let him bite his tongue.

329
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,510
It's not epilepsy

330
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
but hysteria.

331
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,550
Are you sure?

332
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,970
Some people were stimulated in the door.

333
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,470
After going out of the doors,

334
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,470
they'll suffer from psychological disorders.

335
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,000
Some suffer from hysteria.

336
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,310
Once we thought a man suffered from epilepsy.

337
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,630
Later, the doctor diagnosed it

338
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,400
as hysteria

339
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,750
caused by fright.

340
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,190
A member of Obsidian also suffers from it.

341
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,190
Yi Manman, right?

342
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,590
I've heard about it.

343
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,510
The game brings misfortune to people.

344
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,990
Stop it. Save him first.

345
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,790
He must have been stimulated.

346
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,230
You're awake.

347
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,950
Are you okay?

348
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm fine.

349
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,350
Take a rest.

350
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,660
Why are you wandering

351
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,150
at such a young age?

352
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,810
Where is your home?

353
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,790
I was abducted when I was young.

354
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,670
They intended to sell me to a wealthy family.

355
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,590
But I was in poor health and couldn't be sold at a pleasant price.

356
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,910
Then they hit me

357
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,970
and forced me to steal or grab.

358
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,510
They starved me.

359
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,790
Once I went mad

360
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,870
and bit them,

361
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,030
they beat me blind

362
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,930
and let me beg for food.

363
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,630
I was sent here every morning,

364
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,150
and called back every night.

365
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,160
You're also a corporate slave.

366
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,910
We're the same.

367
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,550
You're trafficked here?

368
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,070
Do you know

369
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,590
where you are from?

370
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,470
I don't know.

371
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,830
I forgot what happened when I was little.

372
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,950
Then why did you

373
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,390
get sick just now?

374
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,790
Whenever I heard the River God Festival,

375
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,320
I was inexplicably afraid,

376
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,150
and then I got sick.

377
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,440
River God Festival?

378
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Shut up!

379
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,790
Keep an eye on him.

380
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,710
I'm going to the pharmacy.

381
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,750
Why?

382
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,830
The patient in our team took herbs to recuperate.

383
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,490
I remember the prescription.

384
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,720
I'll prescribe him some medicine.

385
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,070
What's wrong with him?

386
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,610
What's wrong with you?

387
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,430
Nothing.

388
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,230
It's just that after going through a lot,

389
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,690
I'll cherish everything.

390
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,390
Good boy. Don't cry.

391
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,350
Good boy.

392
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,750
Good boy.

393
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,350
Go.

394
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,710
Good boy.

395
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,030
Do you think

396
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,170
her kid was abducted and trafficked?

397
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,230
Maybe.

398
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,520
Why are you back so late?

399
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,030
It's a nice day today,

400
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,230
so I wandered around.

401
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,150
We found new clues.

402
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,510
Can we share our information?

403
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,910
Okay.

404
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,430
But it depends on what clues you found.

405
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,310
It's about the River God.

406
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,320
What do you want to know?

407
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,910
Qian saw you

408
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,510
heading towards the place where Mrs. Yu lives.

409
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,310
You must have entered it.

410
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,550
I want to know what's in the room.

411
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,390
You go first.

412
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,470
You also entered the ancestral hall

413
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,110
and saw

414
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,910
the children's tablets, right?

415
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,340
There's a special memorial tablet.

416
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,310
I don't know if you've noticed it or not.

417
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,260
The name on it is Yu Caizhe.

418
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,230
What's so special about him?

419
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,910
We have to show sincerity to each other.

420
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,230
Mrs. Yu

421
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,770
dragged the bodies

422
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,550
into her yard.

423
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,170
She used the bodies to make human oil.

424
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,870
Make oil?

425
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,190
Did she cook for us with the oil?

426
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,750
Who is Yu Caizhe?

427
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,680
The hostess here is called Mrs. Yu.

428
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,950
Got it?

429
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,710
The host of this yard is surnamed Yu.

430
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,310
Yu Caizhe.

431
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,750
Does the tablet belong to Mrs. Yu's husband?

432
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,210
No, it's her son's tablet.

433
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,340
I found the genealogical tree of the Yu family

434
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,030
in a room.

435
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,310
Yu Caizhe is Mrs. Yu's son.

436
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,150
That means

437
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,790
her son is dead.

438
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,630
I don't believe what we ate was made from corpses.

439
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,190
Why?

440
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,550
Have you eaten a dead body?

441
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,310
Mrs. Yu refined lamp oil with the corpses.

442
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,030
Human oil lamp.

443
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,110
What's

444
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,550
the function?

445
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,440
Isn't it for protecting us?

446
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,350
She told us to sleep with a light on.

447
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,870
Those who didn't light a lamp died.

448
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,070
Okay.

449
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,470
That's all for today.

450
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,470
We're leaving.

451
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,190
Let's go.

452
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,270
Looks like Mrs. Yu

453
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,030
was stimulated

454
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,570
by her son's death.

455
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,830
Maybe?

456
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,760
I think it must have been so.

457
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Let's go.

458
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,350
Do you think the oil is made from corpses?

459
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,160
I think so

460
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,570
because the light is very bright.

461
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,230
But what's the use?

462
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,370
Do you think, like what that guy said,

463
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,470
the light of a human oil lamp can

464
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,130
protect us from being killed?

465
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,480
The oil lamp can protect us?

466
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,510
It seems so.

467
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,510
But maybe

468
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,470
it is a trap.

469
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,390
We can test it on someone.

470
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,350
You're thoughtful.

471
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,950
We can

472
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,750
take them as experimental subjects?

473
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,750
No.

474
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,550
Although one of them

475
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,790
looks silly,

476
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,310
the other two are definitely masters.

477
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,310
We should not mess with them.

478
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,310
We should

479
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,630
let someone else test it.

480
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,830
Do you believe

481
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,630
what Yan Shihe said?

482
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,430
What's your opinion?

483
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,070
Why are you asking me back?

484
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,350
Because you want me to help you pass the door.

485
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,960
Now that you're in trouble,

486
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,760
you have to analyze it yourself.

487
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,030
The sixth door

488
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,650
will be more challenging.

489
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,750
Who can help you at that time? Me?

490
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,130
You just started to help me pass the door,

491
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,690
now you refused to guide me in the future?

492
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,310
I thought you would

493
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,790
be responsible for me in the future.

494
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,170
What do you want me to do in the future?

495
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,750
You're like Zaozao.

496
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
Tao Zaozao?

497
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,720
This name sounds familiar.

498
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,950
Forget about it.

499
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,470
She's a friend of mine.

500
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,010
What did you ask me?

501
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,750
I asked you

502
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,210
whether we can believe

503
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,810
what Yan Shihe said or not.

504
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,980
My instinct tells me it's true.

505
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,310
It's easy to get such information

506
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,350
as long as we pay a little attention.

507
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,510
It won't be fake.

508
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,000
Speaking of making fake clues,

509
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,550
we have a master here.

510
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,550
Speak of the devil.

511
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,170
Have you found the little beggar?

512
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,190
I bought some medicine.

513
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,350
He didn't take it.

514
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,170
Then I found a pawn shop

515
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,570
and bought something,

516
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,190
which was exchanged to money of this era then.

517
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,650
I gave the money to the kid.

518
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,390
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

519
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,990
I wasn't like this before.

520
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,190
Maybe I'm older now

521
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,110
and a little sentimental.

522
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,030
We met Yan Shihe

523
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,890
and exchanged some information.

524
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,270
He said

525
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,510
the tablet of Yu Caizhe, Mrs. Yu's son,

526
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,080
is in the ancestral hall we went to.

527
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,990
Ancestral hall?

528
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,010
It occurs to me that

529
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,190
the beggar told me

530
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,830
he heard a child crying in the middle of the night.

531
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,630
The sounds seemed to come from the ancestral hall.

532
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,810
Let's go to the ancestral hall again.

533
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,830
Hurry.

534
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
Untie me.

535
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,270
Here.

536
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,270
The iron door is locked.

537
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,510
We can't get out.

538
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,310
There is no one to save us.

539
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,310
We can try to save ourselves.

540
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,310
Give me the key.

541
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,830
Here.

542
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,670
What are you doing?

543
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,790
The current will heat the key.

544
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,480
Then the key can heat the iron door

545
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,670
and melt the weak connection point

546
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,670
of it

547
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,130
Then we can get out.

548
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,790
You're amazing.

549
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,030
It's nothing.

550
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,890
I'll study science after I get into college.

551
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,790
Then, we can change the world with our invention.

552
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,790
You'll make it.

553
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,390
It's open. Let's go.

554
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,030
Where is this?

555
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,670
Look.

556
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,510
These must be the blankets

557
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,270
used by those babies.

558
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,440
Looks like

559
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,630
a lot of babies were hidden here.

560
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,070
But these kids

561
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,950
have become the names on the memorial tablets.

562
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,950
So,

563
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,240
they were not thrown into the river

564
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,670
but hidden here.

565
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,150
Then, they were moved again.

566
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,410
There are blood stains

567
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,990
on the blankets.

568
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,000
They must have been abused.

569
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,110
The liquid in the bowl seems to be medicine.

570
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,070
It seems that River God is just a cover.

571
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,470
What's up?

572
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Nothing.

573
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,070
I thought

574
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,690
I have some connection

575
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,990
with this game.

576
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,600
And this feeling is getting stronger.

577
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,870
I think you're nervous

578
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,150
and experiencing the Seahorse Effect.

579
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,990
Don't get hysteria like the little beggar.

580
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,110
Little beggar?

581
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,190
Hysteria?

582
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,070
Stop thinking about it.

583
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,950
It's getting late.

584
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,950
Let's go.

585
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,150
Or Mrs. Yu

586
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,590
will walk her pigs again.

587
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,910
Let's go.
