00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:27,340
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,990
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,930
What do you have to talk with me about?

4
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,550
Didn't you claim to remember

5
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,289
whatever happened in the school?

6
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,110
We'd like to ask you about someone.

7
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,750
Who?

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,750
Sachiko.

9
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,430
I-I don't know about her.

10
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,039
Two years ago, outside the school,

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,870
a student had a car accident.

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,229
You know that, right?

13
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,110
It's been a long time.

14
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,740
Why are you bringing it up now?

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,820
You do know about this student,

16
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,820
don't you?

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,110
She was bullied by all of her classmates at school.

18
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,870
After she died, a number of students composed

19
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,870
a song based on her death to mock her.

20
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,430
Did she deserve all that suffering

21
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,490
simply because she had a poor family?

22
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,670
That girl was named Sachiko.

23
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,130
Not only did I know her,

24
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,910
I also knew her grandparents.

25
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,510
Her grandparents?

26
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,590
What about her parents?

27
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,110
They died.

28
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,070
A car accident happened on their way to deliver fish,

29
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,190
and killed them both.

30
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,790
Her parents had a car accident,

31
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,950
and so did she.

32
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
Poor thing.

33
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,910
Later on,

34
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,590
a reporter found out about this,

35
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,950
and thought it could make a good news.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,070
So he went to her home and did an interview.

37
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,720
He took some photos too.

38
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,550
Do you have the news report and the photos?

39
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,680
Let me find them out.

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,470
Look.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,950
(Victim of the accident, Sachiko)

42
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,790
She's a pretty little girl.

43
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,200
Why was she repelled by others?

44
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,230
Could it be that her classmates felt jealous of her?

45
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,310
Anyway,

46
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,350
she was isolated.

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,510
Look what the reporter wrote here.

48
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,590
So much gossip.

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,070
The whole piece is about

50
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,950
Sachiko's embarrassing stories at school.

51
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,270
The reporters in those times

52
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,270
would do anything to make money.

53
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,630
These photos reflect the road conditions when the accident happened.

54
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,920
It happened on a road in a remote place.

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,510
There shouldn't be too many cars.

56
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,839
Drivers would have a good view of the road.

57
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,630
Why didn't people further investigate

58
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,089
the cause of the accident?

59
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,240
Because it was hard, unimportant,

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,110
or just unworthy.

61
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,190
Sachiko's bedroom.

62
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,940
Judging from this photo,

63
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,230
her family was really poor.

64
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,800
But why would such a poor family

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,120
let their daughter

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,450
go to such a nice school?

67
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,159
Because they wanted to reshape their lives with knowledge.

68
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,230
Hold on.

69
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,740
(Sachiko's bedroom)

70
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,740
The bamboo basket in this photo

71
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,870
is identical to the one I saw yesterday.

72
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,270
I remember you telling me

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,410
that you first saw this basket

74
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,250
in the School Archive.

75
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,470
I didn't know it belonged to Sako.

76
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,870
Thank you.

77
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,110
No problem.

78
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,710
To be honest, you are the first people

79
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,270
to show so much care for Sachiko.

80
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,670
I hope you'll restore justice

81
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,870
for Sachiko.

82
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,590
Rest assured. We will.

83
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,390
Let's go.

84
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,670
It's still here.

85
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,110
It's adorable.

86
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,150
In my childhood, when I was upset,

87
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,480
I would also draw smiling faces on my toys,

88
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,110
just to cheer myself up.

89
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
Did you hear that?

90
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,030
Hear what?

91
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,740
Why are you always startled?

92
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,030
I heard a girl's laughter.

93
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,850
Where did it come from?

94
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,030
Now it's gone.

95
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,270
This basket must belong to Sachiko.

96
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,110
Her ghost goes everywhere with it.

97
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,840
The one you saw in the dormitory

98
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,950
must be hers too.

99
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,110
Let's go.

100
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,750
It looks like the key to the exit

101
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,310
is connected to Sachiko.

102
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,950
Now we've only figured out her ghost's motive to kill,

103
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,210
but we still don't know how to get the key.

104
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,470
Is destroying Sachiko's ghost the only way

105
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,950
to find the key?

106
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,440
Why would we do that?

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,880
Sachiko was the one being bullied.

108
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,710
What's up? Are you in a bad mood?

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
I just feel sorry for her.

110
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,220
What she was put through

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,630
might be more terrible than we think.

112
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,790
What on earth did you say?

113
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,110
I didn't say anything.

114
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,910
Is that Jiang Xinhong?

115
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,150
Why wouldn't you believe me?

116
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,510
I'm just a little scared.

117
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,870
Fear can't help you with anything now.

118
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,110
Just get through this period of time,

119
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,909
and you'll be fine once you start college.

120
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,240
Why are you so sure I'll be fine in college?

121
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,909
What if her ghost follows me to college?

122
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,990
You can go find her.

123
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,310
Let's see if she'll spare your life.

124
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,310
It's all your fault.

125
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,250
Don't you talk nonsense anymore!

126
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,190
Watch your mouth.

127
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,640
What are you doing here?

128
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,310
Spill it. What else do you know?

129
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,310
I've told you everything I know.

130
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,170
Did that classmate of yours ask you to keep a secret?

131
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,710
That's a private matter between him and me.

132
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,840
Let me venture a guess here.

133
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,960
You and he are related to Sachiko's death.

134
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,510
Sachiko's ghost kills in the school

135
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,750
with the purpose of finding you and him.

136
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,830
It's not like that.

137
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,740
Then what's the truth?

138
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,250
If you don't tell us what you know,

139
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,960
how are we supposed to help you?

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Okay.

141
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,270
Sachiko was transferred to our class

142
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,750
in 10th grade.

143
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,790
All the classmates at that time

144
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,020
were from wealthy families.

145
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,950
No one expected

146
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,950
that a child of fish sellers could afford school.

147
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,070
Plus, in our class,

148
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,600
Sachiko performed quite well academically.

149
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,970
Out of jealousy, many other students

150
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,350
gave her the cold shoulder.

151
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,110
Have you smelled it?

152
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,970
There's a gross fish smell on her!

153
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,950
Maybe it's because she has to sell fish

154
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,190
on her way home after school!

155
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,270
Thank you.

156
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,350
Jiang Xinhong!

157
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,780
Why did you have to let her pick up the ball?

158
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,120
Now the ball has a gross fish smell.

159
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,710
How are we supposed to play with it?

160
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,990
Go and wash it now!

161
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,110
I don't wanna be stunk up by that smell!

162
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,110
Hurry up!

163
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,630
What were you thinking?

164
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,000
So stinky!

165
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,030
Everyone took pleasure in bullying her.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,730
Sachiko wasn't angry about it.

167
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,840
So people started to escalate their acts.

168
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,430
There hasn't been much fun in recent days.

169
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,070
Yeah.

170
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,550
Aren't we going on a spring outing in two days?

171
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,080
Spring outings are boring.

172
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,270
We're tired of going to the park.

173
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,270
A spring outing?

174
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,110
I have an idea!

175
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,360
In the upcoming spring outing,

176
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,060
why don't we play a prank on that fish selling girl?

177
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,830
Sure!

178
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,830
No.

179
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,330
What kind of prank should we pull?

180
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,680
Let's huddle up and discuss it.

181
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,870
I knew that was wrong.

182
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,030
But I was afraid that if I helped her,

183
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,750
I would be isolated by the others.

184
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,550
That's why I never had the guts to tell her about it.

185
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,600
Then on the day of the spring outing...

186
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,710
Everyone, gather around!

187
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,470
Let's take a group photo, okay?

188
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,190
Okay!

189
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,190
Come on. Come here.

190
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,250
Let's take a photo.

191
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Hurry!

192
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,950
Grab a seat and sit down.

193
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,910
Don't come over here!

194
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,610
I don't want to sit next to you.

195
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,030
There's a bad smell on you.

196
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,030
It stinks.

197
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,390
Is she gonna join us? Then I don't wanna be in this photo.

198
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,390
Nor do I.

199
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,770
We don't wanna be in the photo either.

200
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,430
Mr. Liu, do something!

201
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,550
How are we supposed to take a group photo with her around?

202
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,310
Her stink is making me woozy!

203
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
Go away!

204
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Hurry up!

205
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,490
Guys, come back here for the group photo.

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,110
Come back now!

207
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,710
Let's have fun after taking this photo!

208
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,710
Okay.

209
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,630
Look at me!

210
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,710
Three, two, one.

211
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,790
Okay.

212
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,190
Everyone's free to move.

213
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,310
Be careful

214
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,350
of danger.

215
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,870
Okay.

216
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,950
Did she go that way?

217
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,350
Let's go.

218
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,470
Sachiko, let's play a game, alright?

219
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,800
Don't leave in such a hurry.

220
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,230
Look what this is.

221
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,310
Why are you holding my diary?

222
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,190
Give it to me!

223
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,270
Stop trying to grab it.

224
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,510
Give it to me!

225
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,870
- Stand still! - Let go of me!

226
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,070
That's mine!

227
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,670
Let me read it to you. What do you think?

228
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,710
Sounds fine to me!

229
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,350
On February 3, it was a sunny day.

230
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,140
Although it was already a late winter,

231
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,350
it was still a little cold.

232
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,950
It was still a little cold.

233
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,070
I was on my way to...

234
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,390
To deliver the fish.

235
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,470
I felt like my hand was cracked.

236
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,750
Cracked.

237
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,750
Why do I have to live like this?

238
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,390
It's well written.

239
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,390
Let go of me!

240
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,950
Give it back to me!

241
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,710
Get lost!

242
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
You deserve it.

243
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,270
You're just a fish seller, but you acted all hoity-toity.

244
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,330
I'll make you show who you really are.

245
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Do it.

246
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,080
Let me give you a shower!

247
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,000
It's pleasant to see you like this now.

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,870
Sachiko, I'm warning you.

249
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,510
Acting all hoity-toity, huh? Who do you think you are?

250
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Let's go.

251
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
The next day,

252
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,950
everyone knew that Sachiko died in a car accident.

253
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,310
But no one cared.

254
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,570
It was as if a totally unrelated person had died.

255
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,870
They even made up a song to laugh at her.

256
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,550
Since that day,

257
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,470
some of her classmates died mysteriously.

258
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,990
Everyone was so scared.

259
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,310
My class was separated

260
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,850
and divided into different classes.

261
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,790
But death kept happening.

262
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,470
Did Sachiko ever come to you?

263
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,230
You all laughed at her,

264
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,390
but why did you survive?

265
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,790
Maybe I'm the only one in the class

266
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,630
who didn't read her diary.

267
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,230
I've never sung the song

268
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,030
made up to laugh at her.

269
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,990
He hasn't triggered the taboo conditions yet.

270
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,710
This group photo was taken that day?

271
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,270
I've said everything.

272
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Can I leave now?

273
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,390
Who is he that just talked to you?

274
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,190
Is he your classmate?

275
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,730
His name is Mou Kai.

276
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,270
He has transferred to another school

277
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,400
and is going abroad.

278
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,830
Can I go now?

279
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,390
Yes.

280
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,910
If there's anything else,

281
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,110
we'll find you again.

282
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,550
A teenager girl

283
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,510
died at her best age

284
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,030
just because of the vicious joke of the young people.

285
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,590
They

286
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,070
should be responsible for that.

287
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,990
If what he said is true,

288
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,550
Sachiko

289
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,550
aims to take revenge on those students who mocked her.

290
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,790
But those students are dead,

291
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,030
why doesn't she give up her revenge?

292
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,720
Not all of them are dead.

293
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,080
Wasn't the guy who survived chatting with us?

294
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Jiang Xinhong?

295
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,070
He said he never laughed at her.

296
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,130
Do you believe him?

297
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,750
I don't, anyway.

298
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,390
And Mou Kai.

299
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,560
They must have been classmates.

300
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,910
Why do you look so weird today?

301
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,390
It's not like you at all.

302
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,390
I'm just defending her against an injustice!

303
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,030
I just can't stand them

304
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,750
bullying a girl!

305
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,590
Don't you always bully me?

306
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,270
She's right.

307
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,440
We need to verify the authenticity

308
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,680
of what Jiang Xinhong said.

309
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,750
We need to go ask Mr. Liu again.

310
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,390
Lingling, you are so smart.

311
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,030
It's you again.

312
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,190
You keep coming to me,

313
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,320
which has seriously affected my work.

314
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,710
Jiang Xinhong is your student, right?

315
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,990
What kind of person is he?

316
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,150
He comes from a good family.

317
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,110
He studies very hard.

318
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,870
We're not asking you about this.

319
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,830
We're asking about his character.

320
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,790
He's quite stable in school.

321
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,790
He's popular.

322
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,960
What about Sachiko?

323
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,520
She got many awards, right?

324
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,590
Yes.

325
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,830
She made every effort to participate in many activities at school.

326
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,110
She thought as long as she won awards,

327
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,990
she could bring honor to the class

328
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,720
and everyone could accept her.

329
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,480
She was really a hardworking girl.

330
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,670
What a pity.

331
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,790
Is Mou Kai your student?

332
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,369
I didn't teach him.

333
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,150
So, all the awards in the dorm

334
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,530
belong to Sachiko.

335
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,109
Ripping the awards

336
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,369
means triggering the taboo conditions.

337
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,800
At least, where the awards were stuck

338
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,640
is like a protective umbrella.

339
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,810
(Annual Board of Directors of Ying Cai High School)

340
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,790
Why do you keep looking at these photos?

341
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,050
Did you find something?

342
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Not yet.

343
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,150
But it's very strange.

344
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,320
The school is sponsored by businessmen.

345
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,710
Isn't it normal

346
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,120
for them to put their photos here to feel honored?

347
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,460
(Tian Weiguo)

348
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,800
(Tian Weiguo)

349
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,110
(Mou Tangqing)

350
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,910
Excuse me.

351
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,990
Do you know him?

352
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,650
He was the director of our school.

353
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,910
He has resigned as director.

354
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,030
Thank you.

355
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,820
His last name is also Mou.

356
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,950
What a coincidence.

357
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,630
Would he have something to do with Mou Kai?

358
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,630
Let's go and have a look.

359
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,630
Let's go.

360
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,510
Zhu Meng and I will be enough.

361
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,970
Take Xia Rubei to the canteen and wait for us.

362
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,920
The boss of White Deer is surely vigilant,

363
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,110
afraid that we won't inform you

364
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,000
if we find any clues.

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,750
How could?

366
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,770
How could I be that kind of person?

367
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,110
Brother-in-law,

368
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,910
I just want to impress you

369
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,470
with my performance.

370
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,990
Let's go.

371
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,990
Are you still thinking about Sachiko?

372
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,310
Actually, my family was as poor as hers

373
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,950
in my childhood.

374
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,750
That's why I was always bullied.

375
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,920
I was really angry when I heard about her experience.

376
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,750
I heard something about you.

377
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,640
I think you're hardworking

378
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
and amazing.

379
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,120
Actually, I was always bullied

380
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,680
in my childhood as well.

381
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,280
You were bullied when you were little?

382
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,240
When I was ten years old,

383
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,150
the company my dad worked for was not doing well.

384
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,150
He was laid off.

385
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,550
Later, my family went through a difficult time.

386
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,750
To support my family,

387
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,150
my dad found a job as a worker in a septic tank

388
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,710
on the street.

389
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,430
Ling Jiushi stinks,

390
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,790
who sleeps in the cesspool every night.

391
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,390
Ling Jiushi stinks,

392
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,710
who sleeps in the cesspool every night.

393
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,060
Ling Jiushi stinks,

394
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,630
who sleeps in the cesspool every night.

395
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:34,350
Coward! Coward! Coward!

396
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,390
Look what I bought

397
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,670
for you.

398
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,150
What's wrong?

399
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,950
Who bullied my son?

400
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,030
Dad, do I stink?

401
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,710
Who said that?

402
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,070
You're very clean.

403
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,690
You don't stink at all.

404
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,150
Dad, why do you have to do the work?

405
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,710
Son,

406
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,350
if I don't do the job,

407
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,710
everyone's home

408
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,950
will become stinky.

409
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,390
So,

410
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,990
they should thank you.

411
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,790
Come on.

412
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,150
Look at this toy.

413
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,850
Is it fun?

414
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,870
Yes.

415
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,190
Why are there so many shapes?

416
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,030
These beautiful patterns

417
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,040
consist of insignificant, small fragments.

418
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,870
You should lead a beautiful life

419
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,150
just like these small fragments do.

420
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,190
Okay.

421
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,680
Give it to me.

422
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,710
Stop grabbing it!

423
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,950
Let go!

424
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,790
We want to play with it!

425
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,190
My dad bought this for me!

426
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,630
Let go!

427
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,750
Stop!

428
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,070
Hurry up!

429
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,310
Let go!

430
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,070
Don't bully him!

431
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,790
So the person who protected you,

432
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,150
I guess, is Zhu Meng?

433
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,390
No.

434
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,160
Thanks to my friend,

435
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,510
I didn't end up like Sako.

436
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,150
Aren't the weak always bullied

437
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,030
in this world?

438
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,190
But there are still many righteous people.

439
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,870
Unfortunately, Sachiko didn't get to meet one of them.

440
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,790
But I'm very lucky.

441
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,270
At the most difficult time of my life,

442
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,270
I met Meng.

443
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,790
You admire him?

444
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,950
Of course.

445
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,350
I mean,

446
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,000
he is the boss of White Deer.

447
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,440
Of course, I admire him.

448
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,120
There are many troubles in this world.

449
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,030
But there will be someone who will show you

450
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,630
that there are still many good things in this world.

451
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,750
To me, Meng is the one.

452
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,790
So, as long as someone harms him,

453
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,920
I will do whatever I can to protect him.

454
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,710
What's wrong?

455
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,870
If I were to tell you that in this world,

456
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,080
there's no such person as Ruan Baijie,

457
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,270
what would you do?

458
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,110
But that photo...

459
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,110
No way.

460
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,630
I see.

461
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,630
No wonder I can't find Baijie.

462
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,550
You won't tell Meng Yu right away, will you?

463
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,750
No.

464
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,120
As long as Meng likes it.

465
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,470
To me,

466
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,780
as long as he's happy, I'll be very happy.

467
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,950
I believe that one day,

468
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,270
he can see the people around him.

469
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,790
Yeah,

470
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,370
they are all real ones.

471
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,690
(Cateen)

472
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,190
Jiang Xinhong did lie to us.

473
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,760
He and Mou Kai were classmates.

474
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,720
After the accident, Mou Kai disappeared.

475
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,870
They were close.

476
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,790
They played volleyball on the school team.

477
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,590
Another one also lied.

478
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Mr. Liu.

479
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,380
So, we have to find Mr. Liu again.

480
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,590
I'm annoyed if he isn't.

481
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,590
Let's go.

482
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,830
Why are you here again?

483
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,390
You won't stop coming to me, will you?

484
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,630
Mou Kai is the son of the school director, right?

485
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,630
How...

486
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,790
How did you know?

487
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,430
Why

488
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,930
did you lie for him?

489
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,790
You know

490
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,830
that all that happened in the school

491
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,170
are not accidents.

492
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,630
Why

493
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,950
are you reluctant to cooperate with us

494
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,070
to find a solution?

495
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,230
You can't solve the matter at all.

496
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,760
If you don't tell the truth,

497
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,470
we'll never find a solution to it.

498
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
Mou Kai

499
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,210
is indeed a relative of the school director.

500
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,920
He transferred to another school

501
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,850
after someone died in the school.

502
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,300
That's all I know.

503
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,230
I know nothing else.

504
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,790
Then help us

505
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,880
ask Mou Kai to come here.

506
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,870
How many times have I told you I don't want to go back to this damn place?

507
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,790
What do you want to ask me to come back?

508
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,510
All right. Everything will be fine soon.

509
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,550
What do you want?

510
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,950
- Come on. - Just a moment.

511
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,140
A moment!

512
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,150
Who are you?

513
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,090
Why are you looking for me?

514
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,780
We...

515
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,270
We are here to repair the teaching building in the school.

516
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,390
And ill-behaved students are included.

517
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,410
Are you kidding me?

518
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,890
If you don't want to be killed by Sachiko,

519
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,590
then listen to us.

520
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,070
I don't know Sachiko at all.

521
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,400
Jiang Xinhong told us everything.

522
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,570
How could you not know her?

523
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,550
Jiang Xinhong told you everything?

524
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,550
Yeah.

525
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,110
He said, you bullied Sachiko in those days,

526
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,750
so she took revenge on you.

527
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,510
Do you think you can survive after you've transferred to another school?

528
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,670
You are her next target.

529
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,470
Why am I the next target,

530
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,590
instead of Jiang Xinhong?

531
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,790
Because he's the only one who helped her

532
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,880
when you bullied her in those days!

533
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,510
Why are you sneering?

534
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,790
Go on.

535
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,970
Did Jiang Xinhong really tell you

536
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,790
that we bullied Sachiko

537
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,570
and he was the only one who helped her?

538
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,770
What do you want to say?

539
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,150
Damn it!

540
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,470
He is a liar.

541
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,780
He is a liar!

542
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,670
Calm down.

543
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,830
Take your time.

544
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,160
If I tell you,

545
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,030
can you guarantee that I'll be safe?

546
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,390
I don't know.

547
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,790
Anyway,

548
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,190
you don't have much time.

549
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,310
Well done.

550
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,830
Catch it.

551
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,510
She's weird but quite arrogant.

552
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,590
Why do you care?

553
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,960
Nobody cares about her.

554
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,110
I wonder

555
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,370
why she's so arrogant.

556
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,880
She's just pretending.

557
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,230
If she's in front of the one she likes,

558
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,300
she won't do that.

559
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,410
Why don't you give it a try?

560
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm not interested.

561
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,030
You can't even handle her, can you?

562
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,560
Of course, I can handle her.

563
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,300
Just wait and see.

564
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,030
What if I win?

565
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,110
If you win,

566
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,270
I'll lend you the new car

567
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,670
my dad bought for me for a few days.

568
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,710
What if you lose?

569
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,230
Rest assured. I won't lose.

570
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,270
Come on.

571
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,510
Here.

572
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,400
What a bad luck.

573
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Zhang Long.

574
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,110
Thank you.

575
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Sako,

576
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,520
here's a letter for you.

577
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,770
I wrote it for you especially.

578
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,500
(To Sachiko)

579
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,260
(To Jiang Xinhong)

580
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,070
What is it?

581
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,790
A love letter!

582
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,190
Shameless!

583
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,110
Hey, when will you tell her the truth?

584
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,550
I can't wait.

585
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,360
Aren't we going on a spring outing in a few days?

586
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,690
Let's wait for the day of the spring outing

587
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,020
to make fun of her.

588
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,790
Don't come over here!

589
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,570
I don't want to sit next to you.

590
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,950
There's a bad smell on you.

591
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,990
It stinks.

592
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,350
Is she gonna join us? Then I don't wanna be in this photo.

593
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,550
Is she gonna join us? Then I don't wanna be in this photo.

594
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,550
Nor do I.

595
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,810
We don't wanna be in the photo either.

596
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,750
Mr. Liu, do something! Do you wanna take a photo of us or not?

597
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,350
How are we supposed to take a group photo with her around?

598
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,990
We all don't want to be next to you. Just go.

599
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,250
We can't take this photo with you around.

600
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,510
How disgusting!

601
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,430
Guys, come back here for the group photo.

602
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,110
Okay.

603
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,230
Look at me!

604
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,910
Three, two, one.

605
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,430
Okay. Go have fun, guys!

606
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,110
But don't go anywhere dangerous.

607
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,910
Mind your own safety.

608
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,990
Okay, sir.

609
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,110
Did she go that way?

610
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
Let's go.

611
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,790
Why don't we play a game?

612
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,230
(To Jiang Xinhong)

613
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,030
Sachiko wrote this love letter to me.

614
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,910
Give it back to me!

615
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,350
Jiang Xinhong!

616
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,350
Don't move!

617
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,230
Give it back to me!

618
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,190
Let go of me!

619
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,470
"Dear Xinhong,

620
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,960
when you read this letter, it's like we've met up again."

621
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,070
- Stop reading it! - "During this period of time at school..."

622
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,230
- Let go of me! - "I'm very pleased about our talks on literature."

623
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,550
I beg you!

624
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,830
"The first time I saw you,

625
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,190
I was already attracted to you."

626
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,350
Let me go!

627
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,840
"Every time I wrote..."

628
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,350
Screw you!

629
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,190
Acting all hoity-toity, huh?

630
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,650
Come on. Give me the water.

631
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,350
You stinky fish seller!

632
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,350
Bah!

633
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,310
Let's go!

634
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,070
The next day, we heard the news

635
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,240
about Sachiko dying in a car accident.

636
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,020
No one felt sad.

637
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,110
Instead, they found it quite interesting.

638
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,270
Jiang Xinhong even wrote a song in particular

639
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,530
to make fun of Sachiko.

640
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,830
None of us imagined that those who sang it would die two days later.

641
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,870
At first, we didn't take it seriously.

642
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,390
Some time later,

643
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,490
more deaths continued to happen to those who sang the song.

644
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,390
That's when we started to feel fear.

645
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,270
I then prepared to transfer to another school.

646
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,200
Now I'm about to leave the country.

647
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,400
When rich people are in trouble,

648
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,860
they make their way out in rich people's way.

649
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,230
Jiang Xinhong is a punk!

650
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:00,390
He deserves to die a hundred times!

651
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,630
How dare he pretend to be innocent in front of us?

652
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,910
I'm gonna kill him now!

653
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,990
Hey!

654
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,150
Why are all the classmates dead,

655
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,830
except for you and him?

656
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,030
The mastermind of that whole thing

657
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,150
was Jiang Xinhong!

658
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,590
He should've been the first one to die.

659
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,110
After Sachiko's death,

660
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,750
he and I felt odd about that matter,

661
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,050
so we've never sung that song.

662
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
What?

663
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,230
Are you happy now,

664
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,199
because he and you have escaped death?

665
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,830
I've told you everything I know.

666
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,469
How are you gonna help me, maintenance guys?

667
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,830
Are you gonna make Sachiko's ghost disappear?

668
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,889
Maintenance guys?

669
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,350
Don't worry.

670
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,389
Soon, everything will disappear.

671
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,659
(Ying Cai High School)

672
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,230
Don't rush into decisions!

673
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,659
We've gotta take some time to make plans for this matter!

674
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,630
My mind won't be at ease unless I kill Jiang Xinhong!

675
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,490
If you kill him, what am I gonna do?

676
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,950
I...

677
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,950
Meng,

678
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,990
what do you mean by that?

679
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,440
If you kill him,

680
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,590
what will become of the White Deer?

681
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,750
After I marry Baijie,

682
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,430
I'll work for the Obsidian with her.

683
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,560
The White Deer will have to rely on you.

684
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,390
Meng,

685
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,630
what's wrong with you?

686
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,670
Baijie is actually a...

687
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,930
What is it with Baijie?

688
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,720
Just stop quarreling. Stop it.

689
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,630
Our priority now is to find the key.

690
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,710
Judging from the current situation, finding the key

691
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,630
means calming the anger in Sako's heart, right?

692
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,550
That is to say, we still need to kill Jiang Xinhong.

693
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,680
Exactly what I want!

694
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,910
Excuse me.

695
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,280
Where is Jiang Xinhong?

696
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
He went home.

697
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,630
He went home?

698
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,630
When did he leave?

699
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,830
After he came back from outside at noon,

700
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,230
he packed his stuff and went home in a hurry.

701
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,630
Thank you.

702
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,830
Get your hands off me!

703
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,350
Now this is great.

704
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,950
The key figures are all away.

705
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,430
How are we supposed to find the key?

706
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,890
Shall we ask Mr. Liu to tell them to come back?

707
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,910
Do you think they will show up again?

708
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,830
If not, they'll just be waiting for their deaths at home.

709
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,830
Anyway, Sachiko

710
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,360
is looking for them, not us.

711
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,270
The time left for us

712
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,890
is becoming less and less.

713
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,750
These kids...

714
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,580
What lousy children!

715
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,760
Why must they hurt a little girl like that?

716
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,560
Isn't it just what all wealthy and spoiled kids do?

717
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,390
How boring!

718
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,600
I wish Baijie were here.

719
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,910
She must be a kindhearted person.

720
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,080
How is she doing now?

721
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,260
Even if Baijie is in this door challenge,

722
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,040
she won't talk to you at all.

723
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,030
By the way, now,

724
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,490
she's working along well with Lingling.

725
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,950
They help each other in the door challenges.

726
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,430
They even share one bed at night.

727
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,430
What did you say?

728
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,710
Are you sleeping in the same bed with her?

729
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,390
No. No.

730
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,710
We sleep in separate rooms.

731
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,710
Really?

732
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,510
But Baijie has told me

733
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,950
that the bed is so small

734
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,130
that she and you have to cuddle together when you sleep.

735
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,830
You look like an upright gentleman.

736
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,030
I've never imagined you're actually a brute in disguise!

737
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,750
Xia Rubei,

738
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,460
let's go.

739
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,710
Meng Yu...

740
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,030
Please explain it to him!

741
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,540
Now I'm finding this

742
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,690
very interesting.

743
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,590
Xia Rubei!

744
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,830
Coming!

745
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,540
Why did you have to provoke him?

746
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,190
He said he was bored,

747
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,870
so I spiced things up for him.

748
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,550
Oh, right,

749
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,280
did you say something to Xia Rubei?

750
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,790
Why would she make a funny face at you?

751
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,230
I accidentally

752
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,030
told her the truth.

753
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,430
When did that happen?

754
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,670
When you and Meng Yu went to look for Jiang Xinhong,

755
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,430
she and I both recalled

756
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,230
some troubling issues from childhood.

757
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,630
As we got deeper into our talk,

758
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,290
that secret just slipped out.

759
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,830
Troubling issues in childhood?

760
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,510
Why did you share those with her instead of me?

761
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,830
Well, one thing led to another...

762
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,960
It just felt natural to spill them out.

763
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,430
Okay.

764
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320
Hey!

765
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Are you upset that I didn't tell you?

766
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,030
I-I still have tons of stories.

767
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,290
I can tell you two more.

768
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Meng Yu,

769
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,350
it's really not what you think it is.

770
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't have any ties with Baijie whatsoever.

771
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,190
Zhu Meng,

772
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,070
are you still up?

773
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,470
Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

774
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,470
That's hilarious.
