00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:27,289
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,039
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,190
What are you doing?

4
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,670
There seems to be something inside.

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,810
I didn't expect it to be these things.

6
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,270
Is it that scary?

7
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,670
Shouldn't I be scared?

8
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,630
There are bones inside.

9
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,430
You're right.

10
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,120
Where is the drumstick?

11
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,150
Go up

12
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,310
and play the drum.

13
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,990
What?

14
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,150
What if I want to kill myself

15
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,070
like Lingling after I play the drum?

16
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,790
Don't worry.

17
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,310
You don't have unpleasant memories.

18
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,590
Just say I'm silly.

19
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,350
The bones are moving.

20
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,140
L-Let's go back.

21
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,829
Why?

22
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,910
Let's go up.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,710
Let's go.

24
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm not going.

25
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,790
I don't want to go.

26
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,270
What?

27
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,470
This notebook

28
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,390
looks like the one we got before.

29
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,390
Open it.

30
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,550
There's a portrait here.

31
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,580
It was torn off.

32
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,990
Is this the page that was torn off

33
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,990
in that diary?

34
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,510
Lingling,

35
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,750
isn't this you?

36
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,070
What?

37
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,310
Does she

38
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,890
have a crush on you?

39
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,870
It's Xu Jin.

40
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,390
This man does look like me.

41
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,000
But it's definitely not me.

42
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
So,

43
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,470
the old lady's riddle

44
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,710
should be a story about jealousy out of love

45
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,240
and hatred out of jealousy.

46
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,030
Maybe

47
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,000
the younger sister got jealous

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,310
when she saw her elder sister's
happy life with her husband.

49
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,560
And she tore it off

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,710
when she saw this portrait.

51
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,350
So, that diary we found before belongs to the elder sister.

52
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,550
Now you keep up.

53
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,670
Of course.

54
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,050
I envy my sister and brother-in-law too.

55
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,240
But I'm not jealous.

56
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,750
Who's your sister?

57
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,630
Who's your brother-in-law?

58
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,750
Meng Yu.

59
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,590
I'll brick you up alive here.

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,990
When did she tear this page off?

61
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,880
I don't know.

62
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,310
But she didn't go up with us.

63
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Lingling,

64
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,110
can I wait for you here?

65
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,870
Hui.

66
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,770
Hui, you're alive.

67
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,750
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

68
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Xu Jin.

69
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,450
You seem afraid of the drumbeats.

70
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,310
It sounds scary.

71
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
So...

72
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,150
I think I understand now.

73
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,909
Let's follow her.

74
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
Keep it.

75
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,450
Where are your followers?

76
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,280
No followers are needed

77
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,950
at this critical moment.

78
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,630
Someone gave me this key.

79
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,310
I'll do you a favor

80
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,670
and give it to you.

81
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,790
You rule the game now.

82
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,350
Brother-in-law.

83
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,070
I look forward to a happy cooperation.

84
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
So do I.

85
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,870
He gave you the key so easily?

86
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,230
Have you found anything?

87
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,950
No.

88
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,670
Everyone, this is all about our tour today.

89
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,790
You can go back to your encampment.

90
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,670
I lost the key.

91
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,590
Don't panic.

92
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,230
The key is fake.

93
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,740
Meng Yu is a fraud.

94
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,030
Who stole it?

95
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,890
What would happen if it were used?

96
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,210
Meng Yu gave me the fake key

97
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,830
to test my ability.

98
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,350
I took this chance to disguise myself.

99
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,750
I didn't expect someone really stole my key.

100
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,000
Meng Yu is easy to deal with.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,710
But the thief is hiding in the dark.

102
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,040
That's why I'm worried.

103
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,590
Let me do it. Let's lure him out.

104
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,070
Bad news.

105
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,750
Zhu Meng lost the key.

106
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,200
Please help him find it.

107
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,720
Why did you have the key?

108
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,870
You said you didn't find anything.

109
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,230
What?

110
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,590
You found the key?

111
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,030
Where did you find it?

112
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,760
At the observatory.

113
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,230
Is that important?

114
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,030
Now the key is lost.

115
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,030
We have to find it.

116
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,210
You lost it so quickly?

117
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,630
I worked so hard to find it.

118
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,950
You said you lost it?

119
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,680
Why did you give the key to this sick boy

120
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,550
after you found it?

121
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,710
Are you satisfied now that none of us can go out?

122
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,030
Lingling.

123
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,070
What should we do?

124
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,190
The key is lost.

125
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,310
We can't go back.

126
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,310
It's fine if we can't go back.

127
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,970
Let's stay here together.

128
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,110
Everyone.

129
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,360
It's getting dark.

130
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,670
It's dangerous outside.

131
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,550
Forget it.

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,790
The key won't disappear in the door.

133
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,230
Let's go back.

134
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,030
Why don't we follow Meng Yu?

135
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,630
He looks more experienced.

136
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,630
Oh.

137
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,390
Are we going to follow him?

138
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,390
Let's go.

139
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,950
I'm done. Enjoy your meal.

140
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,410
I'm going to the restroom.

141
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,230
If anything happened tonight

142
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,430
and I slept like a dog, please wake me up.

143
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,430
Okay.

144
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,870
Wake up.

145
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,870
Wake up.

146
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,270
Wake up.

147
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,590
Zhu Meng.

148
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,950
Zhu Meng.

149
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Zhu Meng.

150
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,790
Zhu Meng.

151
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,670
What's wrong?

152
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:51,950
It's Xu Jin.

153
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,240
Let's have a look there.

154
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
This... She...

155
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,270
What is she doing?

156
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,210
Is she taking a shower?

157
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,710
My goodness.

158
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,510
How did she become like this?

159
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,110
Go back.

160
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,750
It's almost done.

161
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,790
It's almost done.

162
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,710
It's almost done.

163
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,030
It's almost done.

164
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,960
It's almost done.

165
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,070
It's almost done.

166
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,230
It's almost done.

167
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,790
It's almost done.

168
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,190
It's almost done.

169
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,150
It's almost done.

170
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,830
It's almost done.

171
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,310
It's almost done.

172
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,430
It's almost done.

173
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,750
She is speaking

174
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,860
Don't be scared

175
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,230
Don't forget her

176
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,350
It's almost done.

177
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,780
When the moon rises

178
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,030
When the rain falls

179
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,950
She keeps silent

180
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,710
The silver hairpin

181
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,900
The pale face

182
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,110
Red flowers bloom on her body

183
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,110
It's so scary.

184
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,150
It's so frightening.

185
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,150
So frightening.

186
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,870
What happened to her?

187
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,350
It looks like a rite.

188
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,950
It seems

189
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,790
the powder in the bowl works.

190
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,810
It's an ancient medicine.

191
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,790
A tiny bit

192
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,150
can get rid of the fake and retain the genuine.

193
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,150
She is speaking

194
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,470
What should we do next?

195
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,870
Don't be scared

196
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,390
When it turns into a human again,

197
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,350
don't fight head-on.

198
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,880
Hurry up and find the key.

199
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,150
She's back.

200
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,350
The tours of the exhibition hall and the observatory

201
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,430
are over.

202
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,390
It's free time now.

203
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,150
Enjoy your stay here.

204
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,650
I hope when you came back tonight,

205
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,579
there would still be nine of you.

206
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,270
Thank you for your cooperation these days.

207
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,150
That's all for my service.

208
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,910
If you have any chance to come back tonight,

209
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,270
please give me a five-star review.

210
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,750
Hey. Hey.

211
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,200
What does she mean?

212
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,910
It seems

213
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,869
the countdown is going to start.

214
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,870
It's the last day.

215
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,210
If we still can't find the key,

216
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,480
the Door Ghost will be ready to kill us.

217
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,590
The game is speeding up.

218
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,990
It seems that me exposing Xu Jin

219
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,350
triggered the conditions.

220
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,830
What?

221
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,830
This game can be accelerated?

222
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,430
I think this game can be whatever it likes to be.

223
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,670
What should we do?

224
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,950
Let's find the Granny grinding the powder.

225
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,590
You

226
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,390
are responsible for dating.

227
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,270
Me?

228
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,510
Let's go.

229
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,070
Bye.

230
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,630
- Let's go. - Okay.

231
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,630
Let's go.

232
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,550
Hey.

233
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,470
Well,

234
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,400
I have something to ask you.

235
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,750
Thank you for the powder.

236
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,790
You're smart. You used it on the right person.

237
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,790
Can you tell us

238
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,170
why the younger sister killed her older sister?

239
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,470
Because of him.

240
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,350
You're good.

241
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,150
Life in the village was peaceful before.

242
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,350
That year, a young man called Hui

243
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,350
came here.

244
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,350
He looked exactly like him.

245
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,370
The younger sister fell in love with Hui.

246
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,490
Are you looking for me?

247
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,750
Here you are.

248
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
Sorry.

249
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,990
I can't accept your pouch.

250
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,990
I have someone I like.

251
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,150
I'm leaving.

252
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,550
But Hui liked the older sister.

253
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,750
In order to steal her lover from her sister,

254
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,560
the younger sister did everything she could.

255
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,310
But Hui still loved the older sister.

256
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,030
Later, the younger sister

257
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,430
heard a legend,

258
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,470
saying that a drum made with human skin

259
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,870
could go beyond time and space and realize one's wish.

260
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,270
After that,

261
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,430
the younger sister disappeared for three years.

262
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,870
When she came back,

263
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,160
she looked like a totally different person.

264
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,790
During those three years,

265
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,710
she learned how to make a drum with human skin.

266
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,110
She made a drum with her skin.

267
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,590
Besides, she cruelly peeled off her sister's skin

268
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,550
and put it on herself.

269
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,330
She broke her sister's leg bone and made them into drumsticks.

270
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,440
Then she played the drum with them.

271
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,350
She did everything she could to become her older sister

272
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,340
and be with Hui.

273
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,430
So the skin on Xu Jin belongs to her older sister.

274
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,270
And she made her skin into a drum.

275
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,990
It's the drum at the observatory.

276
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,350
What about Hui?

277
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,510
He's dead.

278
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,750
Even if the younger sister became her older sister,

279
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,590
Hui didn't love her.

280
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,110
Even if the older sister's skin was peeled off,

281
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,870
Hui still loved her.

282
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,160
This woman is really cruel.

283
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,310
She's inhumane.

284
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,350
You'll see the real effect

285
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,150
of the powder later.

286
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,530
You're quite cute.

287
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,090
Since you have any question to ask,

288
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,990
can I ask you a question?

289
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,990
Well, go ahead.

290
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,790
What do you think of me?

291
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,350
Pretty good.

292
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,510
I like the scene here.

293
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,550
Do you like it?

294
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,910
Yes.

295
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,110
I like you.

296
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,190
Do you like me?

297
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,230
Yes.

298
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,230
Really?

299
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,070
I mean

300
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,270
I like the view here.

301
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,830
Why don't we stay here together?

302
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,030
Isn't it good?

303
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,040
What are you talking about?

304
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,050
How's everything?

305
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,950
Let's go to the observatory.

306
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,390
Do you want to join us?

307
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,350
Keep an eye on her.

308
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,310
I find her strange too.

309
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,160
Although she's a beginner,

310
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,700
she never makes mistakes.

311
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Hey.

312
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
You stay here.

313
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,880
Let's wait here.

314
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,590
They will be fine.

315
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,950
Hey.

316
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,670
What's wrong?

317
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,750
Xu Jin, your sister is looking for you.

318
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,150
Give your sister back her stuff.

319
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,910
Stop being stubborn.

320
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,590
Ling Jiushi, you stink.

321
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,110
You sleep in the dung pit every night.

322
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,670
Ling Jiushi, you stink.

323
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,350
You sleep in the dung pit every night.

324
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,330
Can such nonsense you wrote work?

325
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,910
You sleep in the dung pit every night.

326
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,000
Help me.

327
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,590
Don't leave me alone.

328
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,400
Ling Jiushi, you stink.

329
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,270
No.

330
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,930
Rewrite it.

331
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,710
We are the same,

332
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,630
being deprived and hurt.

333
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,790
Why aren't you on my side?

334
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,510
No.

335
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,150
I'm not like you.

336
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,910
She had gained the upper hand since we were young.

337
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,510
Everything belonged to her.

338
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,790
Whether it was love or attention,

339
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,270
she won it all.

340
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,720
I will only cherish what I have now,

341
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,070
instead of coveting what others have.

342
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,390
So we are different.

343
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,910
Lingling. Lingling.

344
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,510
Yu Lingling.

345
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,720
Jiushi.

346
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,790
Come back, Jiushi.

347
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,310
Jiushi.

348
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,390
It's okay.

349
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,550
If you die,

350
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,170
you can stay here forever.

351
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,790
Stop!

352
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,310
If you dare touch him again,

353
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,040
I'll smash the drum right away.

354
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Lingling.

355
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,190
Are you alright?

356
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,190
I'm fine.

357
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,390
Here. Let me help you.

358
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,670
Come on.

359
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,350
Xu Jin is missing.

360
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,790
What can you do?

361
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,980
What kind of boss are you?

362
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,630
I heard a piercing sound just now

363
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,870
that made me dizzy.

364
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,270
When I woke up, she was gone.

365
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,990
Feeling better?

366
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,430
What happened?

367
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,950
She was coming at us.

368
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,110
Okay. And then?

369
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
Then I reasoned with her.

370
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,310
She thought what I said made sense.

371
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,510
So she left you alone.

372
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,190
Feeling so happy after messing with me?

373
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,990
Happier than you thought.

374
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,440
As long as you're happy.

375
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,990
Where is Xu Jin?

376
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,880
We've already come to this point,

377
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,670
and you're still thinking about her?

378
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,150
She was busted and left.

379
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,590
Bro.

380
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,080
Can you stop playing that drum?

381
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,120
The material of this drum head is so delicate.

382
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,490
You must not fall asleep tonight.

383
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,610
The guide has left.

384
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,130
It means the Door Ghost

385
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,710
is going to go on a killing spree.

386
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,670
Skin. Skin.

387
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,910
I want your skin!

388
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,550
Zhu Meng!

389
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,230
Zhu Meng!

390
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,830
I want your...

391
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,070
Are you hurt?

392
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,990
Why didn't you wake us up?

393
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,150
I... I did.

394
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,350
I called you many times, but neither of you woke up.

395
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,510
Did you hear him?

396
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,910
He called you many times, but you didn't wake up.

397
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,370
You didn't wake up either.

398
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,650
Looks like Xu Jin is very afraid of this drum.

399
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,110
It's broken.

400
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,040
I was so worried that I broke it.

401
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,710
So, the key is here.

402
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,350
I'll take the key.

403
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,550
Everyone knows I lost my key.

404
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,230
It's safer to keep it with me.

405
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,030
It's not the drum that Xu Jin is afraid of,

406
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,110
but rather that the drum might attract her sister here.

407
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,310
Now that it's broken.

408
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,550
If we meet her again,

409
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,950
I'm afraid it'll be harder to deal with her.

410
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,450
I thought Xu Jin treated you as her lover.

411
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,150
I didn't expect that she wanted to hurt you

412
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,310
and your skin.

413
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,510
So now we should find Xu Jin and give her to her sister,

414
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,970
then we can get out, right?

415
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,830
What should we do?

416
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,630
What should we do? Any clues?

417
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,630
No.

418
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,350
It's the last day.

419
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,030
- Yeah. - Let's look for her again.

420
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,630
- Hurry up. - Yes.

421
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,110
Zhu Meng.

422
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,780
I need to have a word with you.

423
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Come with me.

424
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,390
Let's go.

425
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,950
How did you catch her?

426
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,910
Didn't I lose her?

427
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,910
I was worried.

428
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,750
I thought that I had to get her back.

429
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,870
After my detailed, clear-sighted,

430
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,310
and divine deduction,

431
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,550
I finally

432
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,270
got her.

433
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,150
Is she real or fake?

434
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,950
How could a human be fake?

435
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,190
Hey?

436
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,260
Say something.

437
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,240
Take her to the roof.

438
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,550
I wish your pain was shorter.

439
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,670
It's a pity that you're not Hui.

440
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,790
I can never become Hui,

441
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,990
just as you will never become your sister.

442
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,190
If I hadn't met you,

443
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,630
I would never have been exposed.

444
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,150
What should we do now?

445
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,590
Call her out.

446
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,010
I brought you the drum.

447
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,120
Your sister is here too.

448
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,070
It hurts so much.

449
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,630
My leg hurts.

450
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,350
It hurts.

451
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,430
You're finally here.

452
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,750
Did you come to him?

453
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,470
Do you want to go with him?

454
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,030
He's not Hui.

455
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,350
Hui is dead.

456
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,230
The human-skin drum that can make one's wishes come true

457
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,030
must be made with one's own skin.

458
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,340
After enduring the sharp pain

459
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
and peeling my skin to make the drum,

460
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,710
Hui still didn't love me.

461
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,350
So you peeled off your sister's skin

462
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,550
and wore it yourself.

463
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,150
It's his fault because he only had eyes for her!

464
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,630
But

465
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,950
why didn't Hui love me

466
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,320
even after I wore my sister's skin?

467
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,630
What did I do wrong?

468
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,230
Why should I have to suffer this?

469
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,080
It's not your fault.

470
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,170
It's your sister's fault.

471
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,090
Now that we've found your sister,

472
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,120
can you tell us where the door is?

473
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:36,150
Give me back the drumstick.

474
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,630
That's my bone!

475
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,380
The moon rises

476
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,570
Rain falls

477
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,449
She keeps silent

478
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,290
The silver hairpin

479
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,360
Delicate cheeks

480
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:58,530
Red flowers bloom on her wedding dress

481
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,690
Dong, Dong

482
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,370
She is speaking

483
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,230
Don't be afraid

484
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,230
Leave now.

485
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,150
Don't ever come back.

486
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,590
Don't forget her

487
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,590
Let's go.

488
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,230
You can't leave!

489
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,230
You stay here!

490
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Don't come over!

491
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,030
Just give your skin to Hui.

492
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,970
Hui will come back to life.

493
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,650
The ceremony will be completed soon.

494
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,770
Look carefully.

495
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,910
He is Hui.

496
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,550
Are you going to hurt him?

497
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,070
Why don't you like me?

498
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,110
I've done so much for you.

499
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,310
Why do you still not like me?

500
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,870
Please stay.

501
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,630
Stay with me,

502
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,770
and I won't be afraid anymore.

503
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,750
I won't stay.

504
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,830
Do you know why both Hui and I

505
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,830
don't like you?

506
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,390
Because you're too selfish.

507
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,910
But I like you!

508
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,510
You don't like me.

509
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,110
You like my skin.

510
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,150
You're too superficial.

511
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,640
You'll never have love.

512
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,370
Am I wrong from the beginning?

513
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
Are you okay?

514
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,750
You should give my skin back to me.

515
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,110
Give it back to me.

516
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,150
No.

517
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,990
Give it back to me.

518
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,150
No!

519
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,470
Give it back to me!

520
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,550
No, sister!

521
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,320
Give it back to me!

522
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,590
No!

523
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,590
Give it back to me.

524
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,150
No!

525
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
No.

526
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,390
Ah!

527
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,670
You stole the key?

528
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,230
You're such a good actor.

529
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,910
That's because you're stupid.

530
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,030
The key is fake.

531
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,570
Do you think I'd buy it?

532
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,430
The clue to the next door is mine.

533
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,350
Dong, Dong

534
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,950
She is speaking

535
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,050
Don't be afraid

536
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,660
Don't forget her

537
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,150
Let's go.

538
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,150
Let's go.

539
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,030
Hui.

540
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,780
You can't go.

541
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,510
Toast.

542
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm finally back.

543
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,430
Are you okay?

544
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,910
Where is Ling Jiushi?

545
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,710
Hui, go!

546
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,770
If I can't have him,

547
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,550
you can't have him either!

548
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,590
She is speaking

549
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,220
Don't be scared

550
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,550
Don't forget her

551
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,550
What's wrong?

552
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,310
Chen Fei!

553
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,590
Chen Fei!
