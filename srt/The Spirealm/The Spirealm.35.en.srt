00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,310
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,039
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,390
Lingling,

4
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,750
it's all my fault.

5
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,600
If I'd brought the bag,

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,190
you wouldn't have lost the scissors.

7
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,720
Stop causing trouble here.

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,850
Zhu Meng didn't blame him.

9
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,190
What about you?

10
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,390
Me neither.

11
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,310
I didn't expect there to be another informant.

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,710
How cunning!

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,750
The key is not with me,

14
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,250
it's under the head of the bed.

15
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,670
Remember to take it with you.

16
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,390
He didn't have it on him?

17
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,750
Why do I feel

18
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,790
that he predicted it in advance?

19
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,510
What do you mean?

20
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,310
How is that possible?

21
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,190
Don't tell anyone about the key.

22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,630
The second informant,

23
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,590
I will find you out

24
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,520
even if I don't get out the door.

25
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,430
Yixie.

26
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,990
You haven't eaten anything all day.

27
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,150
Why don't you eat this?

28
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,110
Can you stop causing trouble?

29
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,910
I really regret bringing you in.

30
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,950
I...

31
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,120
Well...

32
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,550
When will you grow up?

33
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,600
If it weren't for you,

34
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,430
Zhu Meng wouldn't be in trouble.

35
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,590
Don't blame him.

36
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,420
I need some time alone.

37
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,630
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you,

38
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,830
you entered this door to help me, right?

39
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,350
Don't flatter yourself.

40
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,310
I did it for Xu Xiaocheng.

41
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,590
Besides, you don't have to burden yourself

42
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,050
with so much moral weight.

43
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,470
Me, as the boss of the door-passing organization,

44
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,190
the decision-maker,

45
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,070
the outstanding leader,

46
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,670
and the legendary shepherd,

47
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,070
I also have the responsibility to figure out

48
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,670
why so many people died

49
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,190
from this kind of low-level door

50
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,850
like the Fitcher's Bird door.

51
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,050
Have you found the answer?

52
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,790
No.

53
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,710
Wouldn't it be unfair

54
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,810
to be trapped here?

55
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,470
No.

56
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,470
I believe you

57
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,150
can lead everyone to find the door and the key

58
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,280
because I see a light

59
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,730
on you that others don't have.

60
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,070
Can I ask you something?

61
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,390
Go ahead.

62
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,680
How did you get into the Spi Realm?

63
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,790
By chance.

64
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,360
Just a coincidence.

65
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,680
But there must be a certain inevitability.

66
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,030
Then why are you so good at it?

67
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,680
I can see things that others can't,

68
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,040
just like I can see the light on you.

69
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,440
Like the lamplight?

70
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,370
Lamplights can be turned off,

71
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,650
but the light on you can't.

72
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Chocolate.

73
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,280
Why don't you eat it?

74
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,390
I wanted to give you one last night,

75
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,760
and leave you another one tonight.

76
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,430
I didn't expect you to open the box.

77
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,950
I've already eaten today.

78
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,210
You won't eat it even when you're hungry.

79
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,550
What if there's a future?

80
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,880
I'll leave it to you.

81
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,590
Have you ever thought

82
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,670
that maybe none of this is real?

83
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,710
So my death

84
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,250
isn't real either.

85
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,190
Will you feel better if you think this way?

86
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,180
You liar.

87
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,590
I told you

88
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,640
I'd protect you for a lifetime,

89
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,880
whether it's your lifetime

90
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,030
or mine.

91
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,350
I can't believe Ruan Lanzhu is gone just like that.

92
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,240
It seems that the note for the 11th door

93
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,590
belongs to us.

94
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,210
I've found the underground passage.

95
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,160
It's in the hall on the first floor.

96
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,470
Although Ruan Lanzhu died,

97
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,030
he must have left the key to Ling Jiushi.

98
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,240
Brother.

99
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,030
Brother.

100
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,230
I found something.

101
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,370
Can't you just stay still?

102
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,990
Don't you think

103
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,790
you have caused enough trouble?

104
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,160
I'm warning you.

105
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,390
Behave yourself these days.

106
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,390
Don't run around.

107
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,670
Do you hear me?

108
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,950
Go to sleep.

109
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,850
Qianli, get up.

110
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,910
Lingling is gone.

111
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,720
Brother.

112
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,830
I saw Xia last night.

113
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,230
Stop talking. Let's go.

114
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,670
More people are missing.

115
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,790
Only eight left.

116
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,630
Xia.

117
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,430
Is it true that we can't go out without the key?

118
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,870
Yu Lingling.

119
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,490
What's wrong with you?

120
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,100
You should ask him to leave the key here.

121
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
What should we do now?

122
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,250
You are talking nonsense.

123
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,310
Why are you being unreasonable?

124
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,040
What are you going to do with me?

125
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,190
It already happened.

126
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,920
Can arguing solve the problem?

127
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,240
We should have had the key,

128
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,750
but now everyone is going to die together.

129
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,750
If we all die here,

130
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,390
how can we go out?

131
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,110
At this point,

132
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,270
it's important to understand each other and be inclusive.

133
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,110
Think about what to do,

134
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,670
how to live and how to go out.

135
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
Zhu Meng is dead.

136
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,710
I don't care

137
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,030
if I can't go out.

138
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,850
What about the manual?

139
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,090
(Manual of Box Demon)

140
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,830
I see

141
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,150
how it works.

142
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,270
What do you mean?

143
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,960
I just let you go. Why are you still badgering with me?

144
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,510
Stop opening the box.

145
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,440
I know who the informant is.

146
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,710
Who?

147
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,030
Who is it?

148
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,230
Why are you looking at me?

149
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,990
What do you mean?

150
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,200
Do you think I am the informant?

151
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,390
You just can't tolerate the fact

152
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,030
that I asked him to hand over the key.

153
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,490
Why are you slandering me?

154
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,910
You are the only one among us

155
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,370
who can open the box safely

156
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,930
without being suspected.

157
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,070
It's because I'm lucky.

158
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,750
What can you do to me?

159
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,470
Have you read the manual?

160
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,630
Okay.

161
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,010
Tell me what's written on the first page.

162
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,750
The first page.

163
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,430
Have you read it?

164
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,670
Since we found the manual from Tian Guxue,

165
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,670
it has been public.

166
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,430
You must have read it.

167
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,350
I think I did,

168
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,710
but I didn't.

169
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,550
Look.

170
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,290
There's something wrong.

171
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,670
We all have a problem.

172
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,870
We never read the manual

173
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,990
carefully.

174
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,230
In our daily life, we tend to ignore any manual,

175
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,320
no matter it's an electric appliance, a piece of furniture

176
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,110
or a new game,

177
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,750
because we subconsciously think we can do it by ourselves

178
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,270
and believe we understand everything.

179
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,900
We think we can understand any manual after browsing.

180
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,600
This game is the same.

181
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,390
The informant is on the first page.

182
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,880
As long as we read it carefully,

183
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,530
we can find it anytime.

184
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,910
It says

185
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,230
there are two...

186
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,500
It says

187
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,390
players have two choices

188
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,910
after entering the game.

189
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,270
First, as an informant of the Box Demon.

190
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,950
Second, as an challenger.

191
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,190
The first challenger

192
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,830
can get a tool as a reward.

193
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,230
The stethoscope?

194
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,829
But there's nothing wrong

195
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,230
if he gets a stethoscope

196
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,030
as a challenger.

197
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,589
Zhu Meng said you were very logical.

198
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,920
Have you found anything wrong?

199
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,829
Ji said

200
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,119
his got his tool by opening the box.

201
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,710
It is clear in the manual

202
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,510
that a player can be either a challenger or an informant.

203
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,360
You chose to be the informant of the Box Demon.

204
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,480
You are qualified for that.

205
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,720
You even took the stethoscope.

206
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,390
This is a common tool.

207
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,270
It's designed to prevent the game from being a deadlock

208
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,430
at the beginning.

209
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,790
All of us didn't read the manual.

210
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,070
We were fooled by you.

211
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,230
I guess

212
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,670
he put it in the box

213
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,910
secretly

214
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,830
and took it from the box in front of us.

215
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,470
You have no evidence.

216
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,790
Everyone knows

217
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,110
you have a grudge against me.

218
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,390
You want to frame me

219
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,810
just by your words?

220
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,710
Yu Lingling, you are so naive.

221
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,190
That's right.

222
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,950
Everyone tried this stethoscope,

223
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,910
but only Ji could use it.

224
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,910
Doesn't this mean

225
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,790
the one who opens the box

226
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,070
can use that tool?

227
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,660
I won't have this conclusion

228
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,430
without solid evidence.

229
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,550
Okay, then tell me

230
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,290
where the evidence is.

231
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,840
Let me make it clear.

232
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,610
I hate being wronged the most.

233
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,750
If you don't have strong evidence,

234
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,830
don't blame me for being rude.

235
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,160
Calm down.

236
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,070
The evidence is in your stethoscope.

237
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,270
You may take a look

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,270
if you want.

239
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,000
Who allowed you to take my stethoscope apart?

240
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,750
Try it.

241
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,190
Does it work?

242
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,870
It's clear.

243
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,350
Let me try.

244
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,150
You liar!

245
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,790
This is the evidence.

246
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,990
You chose to collude with the Box Demon,

247
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,710
so you opened the box

248
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,470
not by the stethoscope,

249
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,610
but by the hint from the Box Demon.

250
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,430
You were afraid we would find out your secret,

251
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,830
so you blocked the stethoscope with cotton

252
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,990
to make it an illusion that the one opened the box could use it.

253
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,950
Cleverness may overreach itself.

254
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,670
At the beginning, you teamed up with Xia,

255
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,270
but after entering the door, you turned against her

256
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,240
and chose to work with the Box Demon.

257
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,230
You even tried to befriend us.

258
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,860
You wanted to please everyone.

259
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,150
You are a triple agent.

260
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,430
He's your man.

261
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,070
It's up to you to decide how to treat him.

262
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,310
We are adults.

263
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,880
We must be responsible for our actions.

264
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Fine.

265
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,760
I am the informant. So what?

266
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,830
Kill me if you dare.

267
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,240
Can Zhu Meng be brought back to life

268
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,790
if you kill me?

269
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,030
What did you say?

270
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,230
Say it again.

271
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,020
He's dead.

272
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,630
He died yesterday.

273
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,790
He died in the hands of the Box Demon.

274
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,750
Stop!

275
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,870
Stop!

276
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,710
Don't come over.

277
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,110
This is between us.

278
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,990
Don't come over.

279
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,470
Open it.

280
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,830
Open it.

281
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Lingling,

282
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,040
Welcome to the world inside the doors.

283
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,790
Even the Box Demon can't save you now.

284
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,590
It's up to you to tell the truth.

285
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,210
When I first came here,

286
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,950
I was bewitched by the Box Demon.

287
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,190
Hello.

288
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,470
The first player.

289
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,680
Welcome.

290
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,150
I want to make a deal with you.

291
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,830
I'll give you a tool to pass.

292
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,070
I need you to be my mole

293
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,670
and help me kill others.

294
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,130
The Box Demon told me

295
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,470
she needed a mole to confuse you.

296
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,150
I thought I would win.

297
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,270
But I was careless.

298
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,350
I didn't read the manual carefully.

299
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,710
When everyone was here,

300
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,160
I pretended to open the box.

301
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,910
I got the stethoscope

302
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,610
and the mouth at the same time.

303
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,250
These were all arranged by the Box Demon.

304
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,720
But I didn't fully trust the Box Demon.

305
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,610
That's why I gave you the password.

306
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,630
I didn't mean to harm people.

307
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,330
I just wanted to pass the door.

308
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,790
That's why you became

309
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,510
a triple agent.

310
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,310
You had a backup for your backup.

311
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,480
Tian Guxue is indeed the one to bewilder us.

312
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,560
With her intelligence,

313
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,010
it's hard for her to be the informant.

314
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,230
As expected,

315
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,270
you are the high-profile

316
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,270
manipulator behind her.

317
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,310
It's hard to doubt you.

318
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,350
So you knew there were two informants?

319
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
Of course.

320
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,910
I knew the Box Demon was going to kill me.

321
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,670
The key would disappear only if I died.

322
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,470
No one in the door knew the rules.

323
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,950
So

324
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,950
I counterplotted.

325
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,030
Luckily, Yu Lingling cooperated with me.

326
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,470
That's why we can turn the tide.

327
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,590
Awesome.

328
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,920
You are awesome too.

329
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,870
You acted like it was real.

330
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,350
I almost cried.

331
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,070
Don't worry.

332
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,960
I still have the key.

333
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,310
Everything is under our control.

334
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,590
What about him?

335
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,360
Take him back and lock him up alone.

336
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,610
I have something to deal with.

337
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,570
Let him open the box and find the Box Demon tomorrow.

338
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,390
Let's go, traitor.

339
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,710
Let's go.

340
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,870
Let's go.

341
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,070
It's all thanks to us, Obsidian.

342
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,880
Zhu Meng, brilliant!

343
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,750
You know nothing.

344
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,870
Be quiet.

345
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,510
Can't you see?

346
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,030
Zhu Meng counterplotted.

347
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,070
This is amazing.

348
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,550
Didn't you see what Xia looked like

349
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,950
when she knew she failed?

350
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,870
I could do nothing but make up a story like that in front of others.

351
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,070
If I told you the truth

352
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,230
that I almost got killed by the Box Demon,

353
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,110
Obsidian would be doomed.

354
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,050
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

355
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,010
I was afraid...

356
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,630
If we can't bear it together,

357
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,230
what partners are we?

358
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,630
Let me ask you.

359
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,030
Were you sure

360
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,910
that you could survive?

361
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,230
Of course...

362
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,960
You still lie to me at this time?

363
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,880
If you were sure you could survive,

364
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,430
you wouldn't have put the key and coffin nails

365
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,470
on the bedside.

366
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,590
Do you take me as a fool?

367
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,790
Don't be angry.

368
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,560
I haven't finished yet.

369
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,920
I mean of course I was not sure.

370
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,990
Stop arguing.

371
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,770
They haven't gone far.

372
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,000
Don't let them think we're having an internal conflict.

373
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,310
I won't do it again.

374
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,670
Come in.

375
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,950
Come here.

376
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,710
Let's discuss

377
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,910
what to do next.

378
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,710
Keep away from me.

379
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,710
This is my bed.

380
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,070
Give me some face.

381
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,870
Okay, then I'll keep away from you.

382
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,870
Lingling.

383
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,310
What you did is for Zhu Meng,

384
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,710
and what Zhu Meng did is for everyone of us.

385
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,310
We all care about each other.

386
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,630
Don't be angry.

387
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,170
Isn't it good that Zhu Meng is back alive?

388
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,030
Zhu Meng.

389
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,870
How on earth did you survive?

390
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,270
Thanks to this red bracelet,

391
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,310
It helped me resist the damage of the Box Demon.

392
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,870
This bracelet

393
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,030
was given to me by Zaozao.

394
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,210
It fits perfectly.

395
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,470
Keep it.

396
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,630
It's good

397
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,950
to remember her.

398
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,750
I'll keep it safe.

399
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,610
It is a tool she bought at a high price.

400
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,470
Why didn't she tell us?

401
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,260
She said it was from her family.

402
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,750
She knew I hated cheating.

403
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,460
She was afraid that I would get angry,

404
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,780
and that Lingling would rely on tools

405
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,230
if it didn't work.

406
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,650
I didn't expect that she could save us

407
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,790
even when she was gone.

408
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,430
I couldn't save her,

409
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,230
but I was saved by her.

410
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,710
When I go out,

411
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm going to see her.

412
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,470
It's even harder

413
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,010
for us to go out now.

414
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,220
In this house,

415
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,790
the Box Demon is becoming more skilled and having more Box Slaves.

416
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,160
There are fewer boxes to open.

417
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,480
Go find Ji.

418
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,470
He can solve the problem.

419
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,670
I'll ask you one last time.

420
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,640
Where are the scissors?

421
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,800
Where are the scissors?

422
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,230
Brother, listen.

423
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,750
Last night, I saw Xia...

424
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,310
Shut up.

425
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,890
Don't make trouble for me.

426
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,030
He still won't tell me where the scissors are.

427
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,890
I said I didn't take the scissors.

428
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Thank you.

429
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,310
You're welcome.

430
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,330
I hope we can be together in the next door.

431
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,690
Whether you have the scissors or not,

432
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,800
it doesn't matter anymore.

433
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,230
But I hope you can understand

434
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,870
your enemy

435
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,670
is not us.

436
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,830
The Box Demon should not know

437
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,120
that you've been blown, right?

438
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,950
If she knows,

439
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,200
do you think the next box you opened

440
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,880
will be empty?

441
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,190
Once you don't have the value of use,

442
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,690
do you think the Box Demon will let you go?

443
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,270
Do you know

444
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,150
what happened to Tian Guxue, right?

445
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,870
What do you want?

446
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,430
Just like you.

447
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,840
You chose to be a triple mole

448
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,720
just to live, right?

449
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,990
Now we have

450
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,870
lighters,

451
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,670
coffin nails,

452
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,310
and the key.

453
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,990
Whether you know where the Box Demon is

454
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,850
or where the underground passage is,

455
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,310
we can cooperate.

456
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,990
But I hope you can know clearly,

457
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,830
we

458
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,220
have the initiative now.

459
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,790
Are you sure you won't hurt me?

460
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I promise.

461
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,070
I can help you to find

462
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,800
the location of the underground passage.

463
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,870
The boxes are almost opened.

464
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,030
If you help us avoid the Box Demon

465
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,310
and find the underground passage,

466
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,670
I promise I won't pursue it

467
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,350
outside the door.

468
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,030
I opened an underground passage 2 days ago.

469
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,510
I'll check if the location of the passage has changed.

470
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,350
This is it.

471
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,710
You found the key.

472
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,630
It's all thanks to you.

473
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,429
It's yours.

474
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,429
Thank you.

475
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,150
Brother.

476
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,449
H-He has the scissors.

477
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Kid,

478
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,590
don't talk nonsense.

479
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,310
Qianli! Qianli!

480
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,220
Where are the scissors?

481
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,420
Give me the scissors!

482
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,230
Give me the scissors!

483
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,790
Give me the scissors!

484
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,710
Give me the scissors!

485
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,640
Give me the scissors!

486
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,870
I have it.

487
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,350
Brother.

488
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,150
I'm sorry.

489
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:26,950
Qianli!

490
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,070
Cheng Yixie!

491
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,710
Don't stop me!

492
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,230
Cheng Yixie!

493
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,350
I'll save him.

494
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,270
Cheng Qianli died to save you.

495
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,510
If you do this, he will die for nothing.

496
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,110
He'll be scared to be alone.

497
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,320
I'll accompany him.

498
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,310
Oh.

499
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,990
I really have it.

500
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,630
Crap!

501
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,310
Boss.

502
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,630
Boss?

503
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,430
You're Yan Balang.

504
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,950
Surprise!

505
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,550
I didn't expect Ruan Lanzhu to be dead.

506
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,250
It seems that the note about the 11th door

507
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,510
must belong to us.

508
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,430
But is it too late

509
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,070
to recognize me now?

510
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,710
I gave you a chance,

511
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,750
but you didn't cherish it.

512
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,870
I don't want to

513
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,880
create this situation.

514
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,310
Ha ha ha.

515
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,270
Yixie!

516
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,630
Now it seems

517
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,910
you have to give me the key.

518
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,760
Otherwise, he will...

519
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Okay.

520
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,150
I can give you the key.

521
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,710
Let him go.

522
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,950
See you in the next door.

523
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,950
Sure.

524
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm enjoying acting as a good person in this door.

525
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,290
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

526
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
Bye-bye.

527
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,070
Be careful.

528
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,710
(Two entered but one returns)

529
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,430
That's it?

530
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,470
Let him go.

531
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,750
I like his brother more than him.

532
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,070
See you.

533
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Yixie.

534
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,380
I made too many mistakes in this door.

536
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,960
It's not your fault.

537
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,000
Yixie! Cheng Yixie!

538
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,910
Don't open the box.

539
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,670
Don't open the box.

540
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,690
The Box Demon is out of control.

541
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,390
Are you going or not?

542
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,910
Let's go!

543
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,430
I want to open it.

544
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,430
Qianli said something in the box.

545
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,630
-Let's go. -Brother.

546
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,070
You can't open the box.

547
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,350
Let's go.

548
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,590
Qianli!
