00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,310
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,980
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,430
Here I come!

4
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,430
"Sako," right?

5
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,190
I'm gonna search it.

6
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,190
Sako is a character in an urban legend in Japan.

7
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,200
It is said that a little girl

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,700
was hit by a tram on a snowy night and lost her lower body.

9
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,400
No one went to her rescue.

10
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,130
She died miserably in the end.

11
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,550
Is this door challenge about a tram accident?

12
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,190
There's a song here.

13
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,389
"Sachiko has called herself Sako since she was little.

14
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,460
That's hilarious.

15
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,960
She likes bananas very much,

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,350
but each time she'd only eat half of one banana.

17
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,390
What a poor thing!

18
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,180
Sako has gone far away. She'll forget me, won't she?

19
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,829
So lonely, Sako."

20
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,770
What kind of wicked person

21
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,710
would write a song like this?

22
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,590
It is said that soon after the song was finished,

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,510
the writer died for unknown reasons.

24
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,790
His lower body was also gone when he died.

25
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,710
Here's the one last line of the song.

26
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,750
"I've lost my legs. Would you give me yours?"

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,030
Word has it that when the last line is sung,

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,070
Sako will appear,

29
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,870
and take the singer's legs away.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,150
This is so mean.

31
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,710
Who would write such a song

32
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,110
to mock a little girl who died so miserably?

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,630
I'll check it up.

34
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,870
Found it!

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,190
Sako was said to be a solitary child

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,390
who couldn't fit in with the other kids,

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,110
so she was constantly bullied by them.

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,110
Sako's death

39
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,510
didn't sadden anyone.

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,050
Instead, many people gloated over her misfortune.

41
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,750
There's plenty of detailed information about this door challenge.

42
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,510
At least, we now know an important taboo condition.

43
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,840
That is, we must not read

44
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,630
the last line of the song.

45
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,070
Yes.

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,140
When will you enter the door?

47
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,430
Maybe two days later.

48
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,870
Ling Jiushi,

49
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:29,960
what's on your mind?

50
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,270
What did you say?

51
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,300
We'll enter the door soon. You'd better get ready.

52
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Hmm.

53
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,430
Is something bothering you?

54
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,390
Nothing.

55
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,680
Taking a door challenge with a burden on your mind isn't a good idea.

56
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,270
Don't worry.

57
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,240
I'll pull myself together.

58
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
Put this on.

59
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,720
Be prepared to enter the door anytime.

60
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,590
OK.

61
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,520
(Sako was an eyesore when she was alive. Though she's dead, people are still annoyed by her.)

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,110
(She's just a ridiculous girl. Her death is a joke too.)

63
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,570
(Can someone tell me her story in detail?)

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,830
(Sako was actually a pitiful girl.)

65
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,710
My dad bought me this!

66
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,750
Give it to me!

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,430
Ling Jiushi, smelly boy,

68
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,430
sleeping in the toilet with joy!

69
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,990
Ling Jiushi, smelly boy,

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,380
sleeping in the toilet with joy!

71
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,440
What on the screen has caught your attention?

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,790
You can't even notice I've come in here.

73
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,790
Oh.

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,710
Maybe I'm a bit tired after watching the screen for a long time.

75
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,040
Why don't you sit this door challenge out?

76
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,470
She's fine.

77
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,560
I'll get back to normal.

78
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,470
OK.

79
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,110
Lanzhu,

80
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,730
I wanna ask you a question.

81
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,510
Did you have any good friends when you were little?

82
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,990
I mean close friends.

83
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,190
Why would you ask?

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Haven't you had

85
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,390
a really good friend?

86
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,370
Of course I've had one.

87
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,909
I used to have

88
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,060
an extremely close friend.

89
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,470
I know.

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,030
It's Wu Qi.

91
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,630
No.

92
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,470
Wu Qi and I became friends

93
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,920
because we had spent a lot of time together.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,310
As for that close friend of mine,

95
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,990
we became friends the moment we met.

96
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,130
I thought we would stay friends forever.

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,220
How come I've never heard it from you?

98
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,310
Where is he now?

99
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,360
We should invite him over for a get-together.

100
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,740
I've lost contact with him since graduation.

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,860
I don't know

102
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,610
how he's doing now.

103
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,130
Isn't he your best friend?

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Why don't you guys stay in touch?

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,060
I guess it's just fate.

106
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,390
Life is like this,

107
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,600
Some people appear,

108
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,690
and some people leave.

109
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,710
As long as you haven't reached the finish line,

110
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,910
no one knows who'll be there to keep us company.

111
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,310
But you won't feel lonely

112
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,660
because

113
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,690
we will be by your side.

114
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,150
Thank you.

115
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,930
Get some rest soon.

116
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:42,130
(Brother, long time no see. I have something important to talk to you in person.)

117
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,880
(OK.)

118
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,190
Xiong.

119
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,110
Sorry, I'm late.

120
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,970
Jiushi, you're here. Have a seat.

121
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,390
Let me tell you,

122
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,030
the skewers in this place are exceptionally good.

123
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,160
You must taste them.

124
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,150
Here.

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Here.

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,230
- Thank you. - Drink.

127
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,350
Let's eat.

128
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,170
Since we last parted ways at the door,

129
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,030
I can see you're even more spirited today.

130
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,070
How's

131
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,210
life treating you?

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,510
I'm really happy

133
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,150
to pass the door with a group of like-minded friends.

134
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,190
That someone,

135
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,960
Ruan,

136
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,909
pretended to be injured and acted like a drama queen when passing the door with us.

137
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,510
Are you talking about Ruan Baijie?

138
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,150
He has something to do today

139
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,320
and can't come over.

140
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,990
Why isn't Ke here?

141
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,040
I didn't invite her.

142
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,950
Aren't we supposed to talk about something between us today?

143
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,080
It's not convenient for her to be here.

144
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,070
She remembers you, though.

145
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,470
She mentioned wanting to

146
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,110
pass the door together again when the opportunity arises.

147
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,950
Sure.

148
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,620
Let's find a chance to pass the door together next time.

149
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,820
It's not that simple.

150
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,320
The organization I'm in now has rules

151
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,570
against collaborating with individuals outside the organization.

152
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,210
I've encountered your organization

153
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,350
once before,

154
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,030
and your methods

155
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,510
were quite ruthless.

156
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,950
Xiong,

157
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,270
you don't look like this kind of person.

158
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,550
How did you end up associating with them?

159
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,030
Well, in any organization, there are always a few troublemakers,

160
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,030
right?

161
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,830
Although our organization may not be as widely known,

162
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,090
it's not small either.

163
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,070
With so many people joining us,

164
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,950
naturally I can encounter all kinds of people.

165
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,070
Why are you staying in such an organization?

166
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,930
Replace it with a new one early on.

167
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,670
You...

168
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,030
How did you say what I wanted to tell you

169
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,150
before I said it?

170
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
You...

171
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,990
Xiong, are you trying to get me to join your organization?

172
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
Both of you

173
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,980
can join us.

174
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,350
Honestly,

175
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,710
if I have to cooperate with a group of people who want to kill me

176
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,270
every day,

177
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,950
I dare not.

178
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,270
Those bastards already suffered retribution inside the door,

179
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,430
and our boss also noticed this issue.

180
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,870
Recently, he is rectifying the atmosphere within the organization.

181
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,270
Let me tell you, brother,

182
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,670
I came here today

183
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,190
on the Boss' orders.

184
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,810
He values your gaming skills,

185
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,190
and besides,

186
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,070
we don't have a gaming expert like you.

187
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,590
We hope both of you can join us.

188
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,350
Don't worry.

189
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,510
Our organization is strong,

190
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,590
and as long as you agree to join,

191
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,520
you'll have top-notch resources.

192
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,960
And

193
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,210
Our boss came back from studying abroad,

194
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,750
holding funds from foreigners.

195
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,640
After successfully cracking the game

196
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,910
and clearing it,

197
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,800
you will get substantial rewards.

198
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,510
Jiushi, no matter what happens today,

199
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,570
you have to tell me, are you willing to join us or not?

200
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,570
I have a condition.

201
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,550
Feel free to mention conditions.

202
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,550
Go ahead.

203
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,620
I want to see your boss.

204
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,040
(Kaibin Hotel)

205
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,790
Hello, Xiong.

206
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
I'm here.

207
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,950
Brother, your information has been recorded.

208
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
Just come up.

209
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,710
OK.

210
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,590
Boss.

211
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,720
Ling Jiushi is here.

212
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,950
Ling Jiushi,

213
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,110
the leading figure among the new gamers,

214
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,530
exhibits a remarkable temperament.

215
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,950
Thank you.

216
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,630
This is Xia,

217
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,910
the highest-ranking door-passing shepherd in our team.

218
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,310
Have a seat.

219
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,630
Do you understand what I mean?

220
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,430
Got it.

221
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,150
As long as you're willing to join us,

222
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,710
I'll accept the conditions you've set.

223
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,590
Alright, tell me.

224
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,250
Why are you looking for me?

225
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,110
Since I played this game,

226
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,030
I've passed four doors.

227
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,960
What's interesting is that

228
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,510
I encountered members of your organization

229
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,110
at each door.

230
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,250
Except for Xiong Qi and Ke,

231
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,790
the actions of your organization members

232
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,250
were not quite admirable.

233
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,510
Well.

234
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,440
Are you here to educate us?

235
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,670
I can assure you that

236
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,260
if someone in my team is out of line,

237
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,170
I'll be the first to let him go.

238
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,790
I can judge one's character

239
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,350
based on how he passes the doors.

240
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,110
The situation inside the door is complex,

241
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,750
and unconventional methods are sometimes necessary

242
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,080
in the face of unexpected circumstances.

243
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,150
You must have used many unconventional methods

244
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,210
during your passage through the door

245
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,710
to become the highest-level door-passing shepherd

246
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,140
in your organization, right?

247
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,650
I only know that no matter what methods are used,

248
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,240
the most important thing

249
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,330
is to survive inside the door.

250
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,770
Boss, do you share the same thoughts?

251
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,630
To be honest,

252
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,270
I'm

253
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,990
not interested in

254
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,750
the struggles

255
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,270
between people.

256
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,630
I didn't pay much attention to

257
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,230
what you just mentioned.

258
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,270
What I care about is the game "Spi Realm."

259
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,110
So far, no one knows

260
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,670
what kind of

261
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,030
grand worldview it has,

262
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
right?

263
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,070
So, what is the endpoint of the game?

264
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,580
What lies behind the door?

265
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,070
Let me tell you,

266
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,350
I am determined to lead our team

267
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,490
to be the first to reach the endpoint.

268
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,290
Don't you understand, young man?

269
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,540
When I was abroad,

270
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,870
I was fed up with being looked down upon.

271
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,310
I just want those

272
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,030
self-proclaimed gaming powerhouses from foreign countries to see that

273
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,030
in this field,

274
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,750
we Chinese are not weak.

275
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,450
It seems that you have a strong sense of national pride.

276
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,870
Alright,

277
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,430
join us

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
and work with me.

279
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,390
Yeah, brother,

280
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,030
join us.

281
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,190
Let's pass the door together and have a great time.

282
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,040
Let me think about it

283
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,200
and consider it. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

284
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,410
I'm waiting for your message.

285
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,680
Thank you for your time.

286
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
See him off.

287
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,670
Wait a moment.

288
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,030
Who is this game for?

289
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,010
You can't say, can you?

290
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Boss,

291
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,270
what have you got up your sleeve?

292
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,910
I've brought him here,

293
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,330
but you were hiding

294
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,280
and even making a stand-in.

295
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,770
What were you up to?

296
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,750
Sometimes,

297
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,440
observing a person from a third-party perspective

298
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,360
can find something different.

299
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,110
So, what have you observed?

300
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,110
Xia,

301
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,910
how do you feel about Ling Jiushi?

302
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,880
Just an inexperienced little guy.

303
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,710
I think he could smoothly pass the low-level doors

304
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,240
entirely by luck.

305
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,030
I've passed through the door with him.

306
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,750
Although

307
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,710
he's a newbie,

308
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,430
he's more experienced than many old folks.

309
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,090
That's because you don't have much experience.

310
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,030
Seeing a few who passed well

311
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,050
makes you think they're good.

312
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,630
Alright,

313
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,550
I'll keep observing.

314
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
Fine,

315
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,210
anyway, I've brought him.

316
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,650
Whether to recruit him or not is up to you.

317
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,950
Everything here

318
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,270
is good,

319
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,110
just a bit

320
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,930
intolerant of people.

321
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,150
You...

322
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,670
Why are you looking at me?

323
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,350
Don't you have anything you want to tell me?

324
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,960
I remember when Ling Jiushi passed the last door,

325
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,510
there were also members of our team.

326
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,230
You was died in that door.

327
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,110
Maybe it was Ling Jiushi who did it.

328
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,120
The person you chose

329
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,910
has a bad reputation in this game.

330
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,030
I recruited her

331
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,090
because of her strong gaming skills.

332
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,750
As for her reputation,

333
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,880
it's none of my concern.

334
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Listen,

335
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,680
I just want to clear the game

336
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,750
without any unnecessary trouble,

337
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,870
got it?

338
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,750
I just wanted to find someone capable

339
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,080
to strengthen the team.

340
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,110
Since you said that,

341
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,630
I'll go back and carefully evaluate everyone.

342
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,710
I'll fire

343
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
those who don't meet the standards.

344
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,870
Lingling, you're finally back.

345
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,560
Ruan is looking for you.

346
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,430
Where is he?

347
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,430
He's upstairs.

348
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,870
Wait,

349
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,110
come over here.

350
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,350
Go ahead.

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,340
You're about to pass the door.

352
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,140
How do you feel, are you nervous?

353
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,550
I don't feel much now,

354
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,110
but when it comes to passing the door, I'll still feel nervous.

355
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,640
What are you nervous about?

356
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,190
I am not sure what will be inside the door,

357
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
and...

358
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,630
And

359
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,170
I am also afraid of causing trouble for Ruan Lanzhu.

360
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,350
Of course not.

361
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,910
Let me tell you, Ruan mentioned to us that

362
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,970
you're the most talented door-passing shepherd he has encountered.

363
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,750
Not only won't you cause trouble,

364
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,150
but you can also help him.

365
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,910
I hope so.

366
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
Have fun.

367
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,910
Please come in.

368
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,110
You're here.

369
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,310
Why didn't you call me

370
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,520
if you were looking for me?

371
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,830
I saw you had an appointment and didn't want to disturb you,

372
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,430
so I waited for you to return.

373
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,290
I went to find Xiong Qi.

374
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Xiong Qi?

375
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,690
He wanted me to join their organization.

376
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,470
The traps we encountered in the previous doors

377
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,600
were all set by them.

378
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,550
So I wanted to take this opportunity to investigate.

379
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,550
So,

380
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,310
you went to their headquarters.

381
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,390
It's dangerous.

382
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,870
How could you go alone?

383
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,990
They seemed very eager to recruit me,

384
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,990
and I don't think they would harm me.

385
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,390
Besides, Xiong Qi is a reliable person.

386
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,760
he won't let anything happen to me.

387
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,640
Have you noticed anything?

388
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,080
The boss of their organization

389
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,630
doesn't seem clearly good or bad at the moment.

390
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,630
However, they have a woman named Xia

391
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,750
who is quite formidable.

392
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,750
She is not simple.

393
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,110
She is a high level door-passing shepherd.

394
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,110
A high level door-passing woman?

395
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,550
Could she be the same woman you encountered

396
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,790
when you passed the tenth door last time?

397
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,920
It's very possible.

398
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,150
She does seem ruthless and there's something wrong with her.

399
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,350
But for now, let's not dwell on this matter.

400
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,550
The time for Sako's door is approaching.

401
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,550
We can discuss it after he comes out.

402
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,670
Avoid getting involved in such risky ventures

403
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,790
in the future.

404
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,870
OK.

405
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,190
I heard that

406
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,870
someone in China is making a knockoff of the game "Spi Realm."

407
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,430
I hope there won't be anyone in China who can create

408
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,920
such a harmful game.

409
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,990
Marx once said,

410
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,670
"Once profits exceed 100%,

411
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,950
capital will trample on the law,

412
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,690
and when they exceed 300%,

413
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,450
capital will disregard human dignity."

414
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,840
The gaming industry and capital today

415
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,490
have become quite insane.

416
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,390
This is different from

417
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,490
the game I used to enjoy.

418
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
You're a player,

419
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,920
you care about the game.

420
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,790
They only care about money.

421
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,050
Take this with you.

422
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,190
Thank you.

423
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,390
Bye.

424
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,790
Good night.

425
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,870
Good night.

426
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,470
(Ying Cai High School)

427
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,040
Li Dongyuan, you...

428
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,510
My name is Meng Yu in the door.

429
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,400
Don't call me my real name.

430
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,130
I'm still Yu Lingling.

431
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,070
They should be around the teaching building.

432
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,130
Let's go find them.

433
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,230
Did Baijie come with you this time?

434
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,780
You'll know when you see her.

435
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,470
(Ying Cai High School)

436
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,600
Is Baijie the core member of Obsidian?

437
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,190
Have you forgotten Ruan Lanzhu's ability?

438
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,350
He's a man.

439
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,590
What's so special about him playing games very well?

440
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,180
Baijie is a girl.

441
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,750
It's really rare

442
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,630
to see a girl who is good at games.

443
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,240
It's useless to flatter in front of me.

444
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,630
Tell her in person.

445
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,040
I'm not flattering her in front of you.

446
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,470
I'm practicing.

447
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,670
How many

448
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,870
door-passing shepherds in Obsidian?

449
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,470
How many people can pass the high-level doors?

450
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,370
Why do you ask so many details?

451
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,030
I just want

452
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,590
to know more about Baijie.

453
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,270
After all, we are competitors.

454
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,470
Don't ask me too much.

455
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,350
You still don't take me as one of you.

456
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,990
We'll be a family soon.

457
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,270
What family?

458
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,490
Who is your family?

459
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,630
Where is Baijie?

460
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,200
You'll see her soon.

461
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,000
Listen.

462
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,550
Don't expect too much.

463
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,710
What do you mean?

464
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,870
Why are you here?

465
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,710
Didn't we agree to let Baijie come?

466
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,710
Baijie is sick.

467
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,270
It's dangerous for her to come here.

468
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,480
So I came here on her behalf.

469
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,280
Is it serious?

470
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,430
She's fine.

471
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,790
She's just too tired and needs some rest.

472
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,790
By the way,

473
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,070
she told me

474
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,510
to keep an eye on you in the door.

475
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,790
Meng.

476
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,680
You know each other?

477
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
This is her door.

478
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,830
Her name is Xia Rubei here.

479
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,720
Don't call her by the wrong name.

480
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
Of course I know them.

481
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,560
I helped them pass several doors for nothing.

482
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,760
You only entered the 4th door.

483
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,390
You seem experienced.

484
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,950
Why did you enter such a low-level door?

485
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,670
She has been entering low-level doors to gain experience.

486
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,870
She'll enter high-level doors

487
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,600
when she gets more experience.

488
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,390
You are indeed a diligent player.

489
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,720
What a great helper.

490
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,750
Of course.

491
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,990
Nine people.

492
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,710
Two or three are rookies.

493
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,990
Cheng.

494
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,550
My palms are sweating.

495
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,950
Xiaoyu, don't be afraid.

496
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,080
I'll protect you even if the sky falls.

497
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,670
They look kind.

498
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,270
I'll go say hello.

499
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,590
Bro.

500
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,390
It's me.

501
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,230
Why are you here?

502
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,930
You didn't expect that I'm still alive, did you?

503
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,190
I didn't expect to meet you here.

504
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,540
By the way,

505
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,110
let me introduce Liu Zhuangxiang.

506
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,190
He'll help us to pass this door.

507
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,070
Hello, I'm Liu Zhuangxiang.

508
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,440
We three come together.

509
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,280
A girl comes with us, named Qin.

510
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,430
She's just like the first time I entered a door.

511
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,430
Look.

512
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,470
She is vomiting.

513
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,190
Bro.

514
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,430
Let's form a team.

515
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,590
We need to take care of each other.

516
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,150
Thanks.

517
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,270
Brother.

518
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,790
I-I know him.

519
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,670
How long are we supposed to wait?

520
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,110
Hello, everyone.

521
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,550
Let me introduce myself.

522
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,110
My surname is Liu, the teacher of this school.

523
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,590
Now, I'll take you to the dorm.

524
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,050
What is our mission this time?

525
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,170
Wait for two more days.

526
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,070
You can work

527
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,550
after the exams.

528
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,550
But

529
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,720
it's not peaceful in school recently.

530
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,030
You'd better be careful.

531
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,370
It's not peaceful?

532
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,310
What do you mean?

533
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,910
Did something happen?

534
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,190
Say something.

535
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,630
What happened?

536
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,150
You don't have to know this.

537
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,550
Follow me.

538
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,430
Please make do with it here.

539
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,510
The holiday is in a few days.

540
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,190
You can measure the area of the classrooms first.

541
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,990
You can start repairing them

542
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,630
after the exams.

543
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,990
We are maintenance workers this time.

544
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,210
Is there anyone else living here?

545
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,350
Or only us?

546
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,350
There are many teachers in our school.

547
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,110
We don't have enough rooms for them.

548
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,310
This building will be demolished soon.

549
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,610
So they moved away.

550
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,960
You'll be staying temporarily

551
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,550
and you won't be staying for long.

552
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,990
By the way, the old classrooms you're going to repair

553
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,700
are in the teaching building with seals on the gate.

554
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,830
When you have time,

555
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,070
you can go check it.

556
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,500
Aren't you taking us?

557
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,090
We're not familiar with this school.

558
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,350
I don't have time to take you there.

559
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,350
I have to teach.

560
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,990
You can go by yourselves.

561
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,680
You'd better go there in the daytime.

562
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,610
In the daytime?

563
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,830
Why?

564
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,290
We can't go there at night?

565
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,790
These are the keys to the dorm rooms.

566
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,510
Arrange it yourselves.

567
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,190
Do whatever you like when you're done.

568
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,910
This NPC is quite interesting.

569
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,430
Why?

570
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,580
How?

571
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,790
Other NPCs are not afraid of death.

572
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,510
I think he's afraid of death.

573
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,070
Let's go.

574
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,480
Go check the room first.

575
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,470
This is too old.

576
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,790
It smells musty.

577
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,150
Suck it up.

578
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,190
We'll leave in a few days anyway.

579
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,710
I don't know how long it's been since someone lived here.

580
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,710
It's wet.

581
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,470
It stinks.

582
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,680
Let me help you disperse the smell.

583
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,880
Why are you so considerate to a man?

584
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,710
This is my girlfriend's brother.

585
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,510
My future brother-in-law.

586
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,040
Shouldn't I be nicer to him?

587
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,250
I haven't agreed to you being my sister's boyfriend yet.

588
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,670
Lingling,

589
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,250
please help me to disperse the smell.

590
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,710
OK.

591
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,270
Thank you, Lingling. You are great.

592
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,200
I believe in you.

593
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm familiar with this. I'll do it.

594
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,150
Are all people from Obsidian so delicate?

595
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,150
Just to disperse the smell.

596
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,540
Why does it have to be Li?

597
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,910
Lower your voice.

598
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,310
It's Meng, not Li.

599
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,490
You speak too loud,

600
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,030
what if someone hears you?

601
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,030
You...

602
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,190
When should we go to the old teaching building?

603
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,150
In the afternoon.

604
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,280
Let's go to the teaching building after lunch to see if there are any clues.

605
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,489
This dorm room is quite small.

606
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,070
At that time,

607
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,270
people who could afford high school

608
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,000
were considered a rich family.

609
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,070
You're right.

610
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,150
Stop looking.

611
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,909
Can't we take a break?

612
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,949
Didn't you enter many doors

613
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,630
and accumulate a lot of experience?

614
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,150
Don't you know this common sense?

615
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,550
You may find clues

616
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,989
anywhere in the door.

617
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,909
The NPC brought us here.

618
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,110
What clues can we find?

619
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,449
Why are there so many awards here?

620
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,679
Someone said there won't be clues.

621
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:52,909
(Awards)

622
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:55,239
Why are these awards stuck in the cabinet?

623
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,850
Shouldn't it be on the wall?

624
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,230
Don't touch it.

625
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
Let's go.

626
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,950
Go check other places to see if there are any clues.

627
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,230
Oh my god, come and take a look.

628
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,430
These awards don't have the winner's names.

629
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,150
Why is it stuck here?

630
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,910
It's so weird.

631
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,710
Putting these awards here

632
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,250
must have some meaning.

633
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,990
Are you sure?

634
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,590
Normally, the NPC

635
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,630
won't bring people to a dead end.

636
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,510
What if he did?

637
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,510
He didn't do it.

638
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,150
Keep it here.

639
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,390
I'm hungry.

640
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,790
Let's go and eat.

641
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,750
Brother-in-law.

642
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,510
I've taken this quilt

643
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,110
and run two laps downstairs.

644
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,230
The smell should be gone.

645
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,630
Thank you.

646
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,190
By the way,

647
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,170
remember to make the bed for me.

648
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,070
We're going to eat first.

649
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Good work.

650
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,510
So sweet.

651
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,910
Where are you going to stick these awards?

652
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,790
What are these?

653
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,150
The clues I bought outside said the awards can't be kept.

654
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,350
Are you helping me, or am I helping you?

655
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,870
The calligraphy is beautiful.

656
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,710
The students back then were so talented.

657
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,030
Unlike the students nowadays.

658
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,360
Not to mention brushes,

659
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,940
they can't have good handwriting with pens.

660
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
That's all because of the keyboard.

661
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,310
Gosh. I'm speechless.

662
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Liu Zhuangxiang.

663
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,230
Why do you keep it?

664
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,830
What if the Door Ghost kills us because of this?

665
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,690
Are you scared?

666
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,190
If you're scared, tear the awards around you.

667
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,050
I'm not scared. Don't touch mine.

668
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,430
You said these things would attract the Door Ghost to kill people.

669
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,670
I thought they could prevent the Door Ghost from showing up.

670
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,910
Fine. I can't talk any sense into you.

671
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,110
Come. Take a look.

672
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,470
Who would put up the awards like this?

673
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,470
Tell me.

674
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,840
You have entered several doors,

675
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,350
but you have no common sense about this.

676
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,480
The world inside and outside the door,

677
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,710
is it the same thing?

678
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,310
Have you ever been to school?

679
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,900
Have you ever been awarded as a good student?

680
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,110
Did you get an award?

681
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,190
Do you know where it should be stuck?

682
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,620
Can you stop arguing?

683
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,190
Let's think about how to pass this door.

684
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:56,910
Meng,

685
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,550
I think they are right.

686
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,990
What if those awards

687
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,150
really attract the Door Ghost here?

688
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,150
Lingling,

689
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,390
I think she's right.

690
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,150
If it's dangerous at night,

691
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,630
you must protect me.

692
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,890
Don't worry, Zhu Meng.

693
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,110
I'm here.

694
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,710
I won't let you get hurt.

695
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,390
Because I can't let Baijie worry about you outside.

696
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,470
Stop pretending.

697
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,030
It's not like I haven't seen you in the door.

698
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,470
I pretended to be strong outside.

699
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,990
- You... - Stop.

700
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,310
Time for lunch.

701
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,590
There's nothing to eat later.

702
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,150
- Let's go. - Go.
