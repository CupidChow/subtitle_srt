00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:27,370
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,070
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,110
Was Ruan the only person who came out of the 10th door?

4
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,190
And a woman.

5
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,160
She's quite something.

6
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,430
The one who can pass through the 10th door

7
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,560
is definitely not an ordinary person.

8
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,310
Did you get the clue for the fifth door?

9
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
Yes.

10
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,450
(Human Skin Drum)

11
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,870
Human skin drum.

12
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,070
Human skin drum?

13
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,760
Is it a musical instrument?

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,430
The human skin drum

15
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,750
is a legend.

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,810
It's a story about a girl looking for her missing older sister.

17
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,790
And then?

18
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,750
Of course, there's something else.

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,750
I...

20
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,310
I haven't had a chance to search yet.

21
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:19,990
When you are facing trouble,

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,550
it would be nice if you could remain this calm.

23
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,950
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,680
I haven't entered the door yet.

25
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,610
Hurry up and figure it out.

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,270
You're slow-witted.

27
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,190
The door should arrive in half a day.

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,590
Don't make any mistakes.

29
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,829
Yes.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,150
What did you find?

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,310
This is an ancient legend.

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,510
In some places, people flay the skin of virgins

33
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,570
to make drumheads.

34
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,990
It is said that the sound produced by such drums

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,250
can connect life and death, transcending reincarnation.

36
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,230
In the legend, a girl was chosen to be made into a drum.

37
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,270
Her older sister volunteered to become a human skin drum to save her.

38
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,150
She was looking for her missing sister

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,070
but couldn't find her for a long time

40
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,330
until she heard the drum sound coming from the distant sky.

41
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,590
Ancient legend.

42
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,950
It's filled with superstition.

43
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,270
Are you tired?

44
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,510
I'm fine.

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,590
Ruan, don't worry.

46
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,870
I can bring them back safely.

47
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,090
Let me take them to pass this door.

48
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,829
Let me think about it.

49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
I don't agree.

50
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,510
Why are you here?

51
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,350
I need you.

52
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
What do you mean?

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,400
I mean it literally.

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,210
I mean, you cannot die.

55
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,790
You can make it clearer.

56
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,550
This is for you.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,390
Some people

58
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,050
are naturally meant for the door.

59
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,230
Qianli, what's wrong?

60
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,550
What's wrong?

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,040
Why are you watching this late at night?

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,710
Aren't you scared?

63
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,870
Aren't you scared?

64
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,350
No, I'm not.

65
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,350
Don't...

66
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,350
I can't breathe.

67
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,230
Let me hold you. Let me hold you.

68
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,110
Lingling, you are really a good person.

69
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,950
I think so too.

70
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,870
Green ghost!

71
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,550
You two are making a fuss in the middle of the night.

72
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,810
How could I go to sleep?

73
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,980
Don't watch horror movies if you're afraid.

74
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,910
Even a ghost would be scared of you.

75
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,930
If I don't watch it now,

76
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,550
I'll go inside the door.

77
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,590
Then you can scream inside the door.

78
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,650
You may scare the Door Ghost to death.

79
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm screaming for you to hear.

80
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,270
Cheng Yixie, come and discipline your brother.

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,930
He's disturbing people here.

82
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,510
If you speak one more word tonight,

83
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,920
you'll go inside the next door on your own.

84
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,790
Lingling, don't watch horror movies with him.

85
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,830
It's too scary.

86
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,070
It damages your hearing and health.

87
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,110
It's not scary.

88
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,930
Do you still want to watch?

89
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,520
You're really not gonna speak?

90
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,000
Your brother is joking.

91
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
Sit.

92
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,890
Your body isn't fully recovered yet.

93
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,630
Why are you going inside the door?

94
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,230
I can totally handle it.

95
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,590
I'm worried.

96
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,690
If Ling Jiushi were not there,

97
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,390
would you still insist on leading the team?

98
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,390
No.

99
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
What's so special about him anyway?

100
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,670
That's none of your concern.

101
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,830
He wants to save the patriarch's daughter.

102
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,560
He wants to save the Wizard. If it were me, I wouldn't care about him.

103
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,830
So, I have to lead the team.

104
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,390
Are you choosing him to be your partner?

105
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,290
You're not satisfied with Yi Manman?

106
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,010
Why are you suddenly interested in this?

107
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,040
If you want to be my partner,

108
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,990
I'll consider it.

109
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,270
Thanks.

110
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,430
I just want to protect my silly brother.

111
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,750
Just say it.

112
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,170
It's nonsense.

113
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,310
Go ahead.

114
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,430
Take good care of Qianli.

115
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,950
Nonsense. I surely will.

116
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,670
So,

117
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,270
the landlady is Jiu's mother?

118
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,160
Is she a good person or a bad person?

119
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,310
In this world,

120
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,190
purely good or bad are both rare.

121
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,070
I'll take you to pass the door this time.

122
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,070
Great!

123
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
Can your body take it?

124
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,070
I'm fine now.

125
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,950
Wear this.

126
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,880
Take it off as soon as you get in.

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,310
Go get changed.

128
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,430
Okay.

129
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,270
Coming.

130
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,310
Let's go.

131
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,640
How did I bring this with me?

132
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,110
Where are they?

133
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,830
Don't.

134
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,150
Don't hit me.

135
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,230
Who are you?

136
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,870
Where am I?

137
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,670
I'm so scared.

138
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,270
Look.

139
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,910
You're hitting me.

140
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,170
What are you afraid of?

141
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,350
Hui.

142
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,590
Hui, you're not dead.

143
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,550
I've been waiting for you.

144
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,150
Who is Hui?

145
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,230
Do we know each other?

146
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,150
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,150
I... I mistook you for someone else.

148
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,730
You just came here, right?

149
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,490
It's getting dark.

150
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,630
We need to go to the destination now.

151
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,630
Destination?

152
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,150
Who are you?

153
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,870
Where is this?

154
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Is this...

155
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
a kaleidoscope?

156
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,630
I don't know if it was broken.

157
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,510
It's someone else's stuff. I have to return it.

158
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,670
Let's talk on the way.

159
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,110
Well,

160
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,790
I'm Yu Lingling. What about you?

161
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,670
I'm Xu Jin.

162
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,710
How did you start playing the game, Spi Realm?

163
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,830
Game? What game?

164
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,350
Maybe you accidentally opened it,

165
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,480
and you didn't know.

166
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,630
This is a game?

167
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,350
There are 12 doors in total.

168
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,550
You have to clear the game

169
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,080
before you can get rid of it.

170
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,030
You probably

171
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,150
accidentally opened a door at home

172
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,150
and ended up here.

173
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,410
Do you remember it?

174
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,710
I don't remember.

175
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,830
It's okay.

176
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,110
Just remember.

177
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,390
You have to be careful here.

178
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,630
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

179
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,390
My life will be in danger?

180
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,670
I don't want to take risks. I want to go home.

181
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,670
Don't run around.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,350
If you keep running like this,

183
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,750
you'll be in real danger.

184
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,670
Trust me.

185
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,990
Hui.

186
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,990
If you really want to see Hui again,

187
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,640
you have to stay alive.

188
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,470
That should be the village.

189
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,600
Let's go there and join the others.

190
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,110
Let's go.

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,670
Attention, late tourists, please hurry up.

192
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,360
Who is she?

193
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,710
She's an NPC in the game.

194
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,030
What is an NPC?

195
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,190
I won't explain.

196
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,070
Let's go inside first.

197
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,070
Okay.

198
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,230
Say something. Where are we?

199
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,590
I... I'm telling you, don't lie to me.

200
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,990
I've already called the police.

201
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,390
The police are on the way.

202
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,590
It's okay.

203
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,110
He should be a newcomer like you.

204
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,470
Do you... Do you know where this is?

205
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,470
Let's go.

206
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,720
Please come in.

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,310
I was playing games at home,

208
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,350
and I was about to achieve a pentakill.

209
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,010
How did I...

210
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,110
How did I come here

211
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,470
with a swoosh?

212
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,110
Tell me where this place is.

213
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,470
Can you shut up?

214
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,770
I've been listening to your nagging all the way.

215
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,230
If you are able,

216
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,520
find a way to clear this and get out.

217
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,950
If you think you can't do it,

218
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,480
just shut up and wait to die.

219
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,830
Do you understand?

220
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,540
There are quite a few people here, twelve in total.

221
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,590
I'm going out now.

222
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,750
I will definitely find a way out.

223
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,190
Hey. Friend.

224
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,190
Don't.

225
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,470
It might be safer here.

226
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,480
Calm down.

227
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Safe?

228
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,930
Where did this nice guy come from?

229
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,990
You're so kind

230
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,470
and good at comforting people.

231
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,230
Why don't you help him clear the game

232
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,230
and save his life?

233
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,200
Will you?

234
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,460
It's okay. Have a seat.

235
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,110
How rude.

236
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,390
What did you say?

237
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,350
Is it polite to say that in front of me?

238
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
Friend.

239
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,800
You don't have to be so aggressive.

240
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,910
Don't touch me.

241
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
What?

242
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,750
You want a fight?

243
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,350
Come on.

244
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,840
I'll let you start first with three moves.

245
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,390
Come on.

246
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,270
Friend.

247
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,150
You're so young.

248
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,230
Why are you so hot-tempered?

249
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,750
Who are you?

250
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,270
You're together?

251
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,790
Hands off me.

252
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,150
What if I don't?

253
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,630
Let go, let go.

254
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Take it easy.

255
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,990
Take it easy.

256
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Okay.

257
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm Meng Yu, and this is my fourth time passing doors.

258
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,350
I'm Yu Lingling, and it's my third time.

259
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,510
Sit down.

260
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,390
Let's go.

261
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,730
You're quite skilled.

262
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,390
Looks like my money was well spent.

263
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,600
Bro, are you feeling unwell?

264
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,870
Are you okay?

265
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,990
I'm fine.

266
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,670
I've been in poor health since I was little.

267
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,070
Thanks for your concern.

268
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,690
My name is Zhu Meng.

269
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,910
I'm Mu Yu.

270
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,350
She is Xu Jin.

271
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,470
She's a newcomer.

272
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,000
I asked the woman

273
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,050
outside about the situation.

274
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,010
She said that she was a tour guide.

275
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,590
We're all here for a tour.

276
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,140
Tour?

277
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,510
Did she tell you when we could get out?

278
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,870
No.

279
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,590
She just said that we have to visit all the attractions,

280
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,320
and there might be a time limit.

281
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,200
It's still unclear for now.

282
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,870
Where are we staying tonight?

283
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,870
Right here?

284
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,390
The rooms are on the second floor.

285
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,790
Each room has three beds.

286
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
Let's divide them up.

287
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,440
Why don't we stay together?

288
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,750
Isn't it safer to stay together?

289
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,150
If we live separately, we'll minimize the losses.

290
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,510
If we stay together,

291
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,990
we might all be caught at once,

292
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,990
and it's easier to fall asleep together.

293
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,620
Why are we dividing rooms? What danger?

294
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,150
Do you have any clues at all?

295
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,150
Currently, we don't have any clues.

296
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,400
There should be some tomorrow.

297
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,270
If there's nothing else,

298
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,870
go to bed early.

299
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,460
Let's go.

300
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,349
Mr. Meng,

301
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,390
can we stay with you?

302
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,109
We can squeeze in.

303
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,880
Men and women should live separately.

304
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,920
You protect me.

305
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,150
Money is not a problem.

306
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,270
Got it.

307
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,330
What's the situation now?

308
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,070
Meng Yu is not simple.

309
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,340
That woman offered me a lot of money to take her to pass the door,

310
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,750
but I thought she was annoying and didn't agree.

311
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,270
Now that she's with Meng Yu,

312
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,270
it means Meng Yu

313
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,810
is also a door-passing shepherd.

314
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,630
Should we pretend not to know each other?

315
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,290
Don't bother in front of them.

316
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,990
That woman must have told him already.

317
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,710
Got it.

318
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,920
Why are you still so grumpy?

319
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,230
I just don't like those hypocrites.

320
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,950
Let me tell you.

321
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,560
Looks like they have some experience.

322
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,790
Don't mess with them.

323
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,350
The key is

324
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,190
that we need to get the key before they do.

325
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,830
Zhu Meng, let's share a room together.

326
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,190
Sure.

327
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,190
Yu Lingling, can I stay with you?

328
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,230
Sure.

329
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,190
Where are you?

330
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,830
Where are you?

331
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,990
Where are you?

332
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,390
Where are you?

333
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,750
Where are you?

334
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,040
What are you looking at?

335
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,150
It's so foggy.

336
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,310
Go to sleep.

337
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,200
Are you feeling unwell?

338
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
You have a fever.

339
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,830
Go to sleep.

340
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,590
Where are you?

341
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,950
Where are you?

342
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,270
You dropped your quilt in the middle of the night,

343
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,600
so I picked it up for you.

344
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,630
Thanks.

345
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,270
Morning.

346
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,480
You look energetic.

347
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,800
Get some more sleep.

348
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,880
No.

349
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,470
I've already slept long enough inside the door.

350
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,750
Let's go touring.

351
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,750
Let's go.

352
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,630
Today, we are visiting the local exhibition hall.

353
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,230
It is the most beautiful and quaint building in the area.

354
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,630
It used to be very prosperous,

355
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,950
but gradually fell into disuse

356
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,230
due to various complex reasons.

357
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,550
However, at the same time,

358
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,230
due to a decrease in human activity,

359
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,670
this village still retains

360
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,130
its original appearance.

361
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,670
My name is Wang Xiaoyou.

362
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,070
I've passed two doors.

363
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,670
Can I team up with you?

364
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,630
I've already teamed up with him.

365
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,750
Do you mind having one more person?

366
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,750
Yes.

367
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,150
Meng Yu, who is behind us,

368
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,750
should be the most experienced person here.

369
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,870
It's safer for you to team up with him.

370
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,000
He's weird.

371
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,030
I didn't do anything.

372
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,390
She suddenly wants to join us.

373
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,990
Either she's stupid or she has bad intentions.

374
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,850
What's that sound?

375
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,720
This kind of music,

376
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,750
performed with the village's unique instruments,

377
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,010
has high artistry and distinctiveness.

378
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,510
I hope that with this music,

379
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,480
today's journey will leave a deep impression on everyone.

380
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,960
The material of this flag doesn't seem right.

381
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,280
Yeah, the leather is so delicate.

382
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,400
It shouldn't come from livestock.

383
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,910
The pores are so small

384
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,230
and few.

385
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,150
I think this kind of creature

386
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,480
wouldn't survive outdoors in the winter.

387
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,960
Next is free exploration time.

388
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,910
I will come to pick everyone up before it gets dark.

389
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,670
Please enjoy yourselves here.

390
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,280
Do not leave the exhibition hall and its surrounding areas.

391
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,110
Especially, do not look up.

392
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,350
Do not look up.

393
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,040
What does that mean?

394
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,790
What will happen if we look up?

395
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,870
It's not good for the neck.

396
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,330
Normally, this is a taboo condition.

397
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,950
If accidentally triggered,

398
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,010
it will summon the Door Ghost to kill.

399
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,470
If you find any clues later,

400
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,910
let's communicate and share them with each other.

401
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,910
If you're okay,

402
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,250
we're okay with it too.

403
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,230
Let's go.

404
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,830
This house looks so scary.

405
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,510
I hope there are no monsters inside.

406
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,510
How about we go in,

407
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,070
and you wait here?

408
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,150
No, no, I'd rather go with you.

409
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,350
I'm more scared of being alone here.

410
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,350
Let's go.

411
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,670
The sound seems to be coming from the second floor.

412
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,230
But that's not right.

413
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,950
There isn't a second floor here.

414
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,610
Then, where does it come from?

415
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,150
The ceiling?

416
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,150
Don't look up.

417
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,190
The tour guide told us not to look up.

418
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,510
Oh, right.

419
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,120
You've run too far away.

420
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,270
Remember not to wander around anymore.

421
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,270
You don't seem to care much about me.

422
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,190
Don't you believe we might actually cut you out?

423
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
I do believe it.

424
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,950
This place makes me feel so depressed

425
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,750
and scared, Lingling.

426
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,150
Ah?

427
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,870
Lingling, I'm scared too.

428
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,990
You are a grown man.

429
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,870
Why are you so timid?

430
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,870
Who says men can't be easily frightened?

431
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,030
Look at this mural.

432
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,670
I guess it illustrates the local folklore.

433
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,740
The painting is about two sisters playing hide-and-seek.

434
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,910
The older one has gone out of sight, hiding away.

435
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,840
The younger one can never find her.

436
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,950
Is this the story about the human skin drum?

437
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,610
The younger sister keeps looking for the older one.

438
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,020
Young fella, you know so much.

439
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,430
You haven't known my age yet.

440
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,880
Isn't it too early to call me "young fella"?

441
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
How old are you?

442
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,790
I'm 25.

443
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,910
Oh.

444
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,390
But I'm only 24.

445
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,350
I should call you "Ma'am."

446
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,830
Ma'am.

447
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,990
A sound is coming from that place.

448
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,120
Let's go take a look.

449
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,630
I'm scared. I'll be waiting here for you.

450
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,790
Okay.

451
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,390
Ancient remedies and miracle drugs help restore health.

452
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,270
Effective cures eliminate the falsehood from the truth.

453
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,270
Gentlemen, care to give it a try?

454
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,310
No, madam.

455
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,110
I'd like to ask you something.

456
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,670
What kind of story does the mural

457
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,600
in the exhibition hall try to tell?

458
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,790
Two sisters attend a funeral,

459
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,070
during which the younger one falls in love with a young man.

460
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,350
The older one goes home and dies.

461
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,350
What kind of story would you say it is?

462
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,790
It warns people not to easily fall in love with others.

463
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,670
Maybe don't bother using your brain.

464
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,670
Just let it rest.

465
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,790
Sir, why don't you try this medicine?

466
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,950
Those in poor health

467
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,030
will get well right after eating it.

468
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,270
Zhu Meng, why not take it?

469
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,510
This old lady has pointed out your poor health.

470
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,670
I shouldn't have stopped you from looking up at the ceiling just now.

471
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,750
He's actually quite healthy.

472
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,480
Thank you for the offer, madam.

473
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,470
There's a ladder up to the roof.

474
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,590
Shall we go up there and check it out?

475
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,590
Okay.

476
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,960
Are you still mad at me?

477
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,830
Who is Xu Jin?

478
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,350
I can't believe you'd ditch me for her.

479
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,950
She's new to the game.

480
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,310
I met her soon after I entered the door.

481
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,770
She asked to stick with me.

482
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,750
If I had rejected her

483
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,630
and accepted you instead,

484
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,510
wouldn't it have been obvious that we had teamed up?

485
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,510
Besides,

486
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,920
now that you're sharing a room with people other than us,

487
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
you might be able to find some clues.

488
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,470
That means I'm still useful, right?

489
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,530
Of course, you are.

490
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,830
Lingling,

491
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,630
you and I will go up there,

492
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,960
while Zhu Meng stays put,

493
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,160
so he can notify us if anything happens.

494
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,200
Kiddo, you've grown up.

495
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,470
Go ahead.

496
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,840
It's so scary. We should leave.

497
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,510
Are you okay?

498
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,070
What happened? Did you slip?

499
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,190
Someone pushed me.

500
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,630
Ah?

501
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,110
You were pushed?

502
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,310
But there were no other people up there.

503
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,190
What's wrong?

504
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,950
Are you alright?

505
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,270
No one else was up there, right?

506
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,000
There's blood on your back.

507
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,150
Huh?

508
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,070
W-Was there a monster?

509
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,570
I got this up there.

510
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,410
It seems to be a drumstick.

511
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,280
It's used for beating drums. Maybe a human skin drum?

512
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,150
Would she know something about it?

513
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,150
Go ask her.

514
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,750
Madam,

515
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
how long have you lived here?

516
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,230
Since a long long time ago.

517
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,750
Back then,

518
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,110
it was still proper to address me as "madam."

519
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,110
Do you know where the villagers have gone?

520
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,710
They've all run away.

521
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,390
In the village, there used to be two sisters.

522
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,890
The older one suddenly disappeared.

523
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,710
The younger one tried to find her but ended up missing as well.

524
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,830
Then, demons started haunting the village.

525
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,350
Everyone was in a panic.

526
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,550
So, all the villagers ran away.

527
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,760
Why didn't you run away?

528
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,600
Weren't you afraid of demons?

529
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,430
I got too old to run away.

530
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,750
Do you know

531
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,670
what this is for?

532
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,750
It is fate that has led you

533
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,990
to find it.

534
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,790
You should keep it.

535
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,110
Have you got any findings?

536
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,230
You look a bit pale.

537
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,230
Do you need a rest?

538
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,390
I'm fine.

539
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,870
Ah! There's blood from above!

540
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,480
Meng Yu!

541
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,950
Don't look up!

542
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,190
I don't want to die.

543
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,550
I've spent so much money,

544
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,910
and yet there's a lot more I haven't spent!

545
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,950
I can't die now!

546
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,430
If you don't look up, you won't die.

547
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,020
Everyone, do not look up.

548
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,110
The sound comes from above.

549
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,550
Whoever hears it, will involuntarily look up.

550
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,830
That's a taboo condition.

551
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,870
Guys, beware!

552
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,949
We'd better not break any rules.

553
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:12,830
This is horrible.

554
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,360
We should leave right away!

555
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:17,389
There are still 30 minutes before the appointed time.

556
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,110
But it's gonna rain outside.

557
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,370
How did she know it would rain?

558
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,389
The weather is so bad.

559
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,710
There's no doubt it'll rain at any time.

560
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,510
Do you hear something?

561
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,790
What?

562
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,909
Drumbeats.

563
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,670
Xu Jin,

564
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,180
you seem to fear these drumbeats.

565
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,590
They sound horrifying.

566
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,590
T-This place is so scary.

567
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,030
We'd better leave now!

568
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,230
Let's get out of here!

569
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,270
Shut up!

570
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,430
No more yelling and crying.

571
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,070
The tour guide has said that no one can leave until the tour is over.

572
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,510
Stop panicking, guys!

573
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,270
We haven't violated any rules.

574
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,150
That thing might not kill us.

575
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,310
But...

576
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,470
But staying here won't do us any good!

577
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,470
But what?

578
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,910
But what?

579
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,000
What are you trying to say?

580
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,630
You can either go out now

581
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,950
or wait for me to throw you out!

582
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,910
I'm not going out!

583
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,670
I don't want to die!

584
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
- Get out! - I won't!

585
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,070
- Go! - I'm not going out!

586
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,110
Coward!

587
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,770
You're a bunch of cowards!

588
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,270
Meng Yu!

589
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,440
Something is wrong with the sound of the rain.

590
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,870
Instead of rain,

591
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,130
it's pouring needles.

592
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,550
Do you mean this is a rain of needles?

593
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,990
How come?

594
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,150
Help!

595
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,990
Hey!

596
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,990
Help!

597
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,190
Mr. Huang!

598
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,910
Were you close to him?

599
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,750
N-No.

600
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,470
I just think he died a tragic death.

601
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,780
Will we be able to leave this place?

602
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,550
Will we all die outside?

603
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,310
But the spot where we're supposed to meet the tour guide

604
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,310
is outside.

605
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,670
It's almost time.

606
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,800
Are we gonna be stuck here forever?

607
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,510
Dear visitors,

608
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,990
the exhibition hall is about to close.

609
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,310
Please leave in an orderly fashion.

610
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,790
Gather around!

611
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,510
Follow my flag, and do not fall behind!

612
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,190
Let's go.

613
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,270
Go?

614
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,390
If we go out now,

615
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,950
we'll be killed by the needles!

616
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,510
The tour guide is standing outside, safe and sound.

617
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,670
A man just died. We can't stay here

618
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,970
and spend the night at this place, can we?

619
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,830
Gather around!

620
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,350
Follow my flag, and do not fall behind.

621
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,400
Everyone's here now, right?

622
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
We need to go back before nightfall.

623
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,710
How was your tour?
