00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:27,490
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,830
Someone's here.

4
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,789
It's you!

5
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,150
Why are you sleeping here?

6
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,729
Keep your egg safe.

7
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,870
- Thank you. - Sleep?

8
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,160
Luckily, you're smart.

9
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,870
The triplets gave me the key.

10
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,030
Are they asking me to save you?

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,910
You met the triplets?

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,330
You tell them apart?

13
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,990
O-Of course.

14
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,870
Alright. No.

15
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,110
I knew it.

16
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,910
Not being able to tell the triplets apart

17
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,310
is not a taboo condition.

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,830
Then why are they so persistent in

19
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,490
wanting us to tell them apart?

20
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,120
Let's go back first.

21
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,390
Let's go.

22
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,190
Who is it?

23
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,310
It's me, Zhu.

24
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,470
I have to come and share a room with you.

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,400
No, the bed is too small.

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,760
I can sleep on the floor.

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,079
Hey.

28
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,390
It's too depressing to share a room with Tian Yan.

29
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,870
I'm afraid I'll expose myself if I say something wrong.

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,510
I won't go out, no matter what you say today.

31
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,680
Drag me out if you dare.

32
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,230
You're so darn heavy.

33
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,870
Who can drag you?

34
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,230
Who are you talking about?

35
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
You.

36
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,190
Aren't you named Xu Xiaochen?

37
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,670
That's Cheng, not Chen.

38
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,830
Forget it. I'll sleep on the floor.

39
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
No.

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,070
It's improper for men and women to sleep in the same room.

41
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,070
Let her do it.

42
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,829
She saved us.

43
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,990
It's good to be alive inside the door.

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,250
We can't care too much.

45
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,990
Turn off the lights.

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,990
Time to go to bed.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,750
Love you, Lingling!

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,250
I'm kind enough to let you in. You'd better not be a chatterbox.

49
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,430
Do you think

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,390
someone will die tonight?

51
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm afraid that we'll lose another person

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,750
before we know it.

53
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,930
Thank you, the organizing committee of the Oscars.

54
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,560
I'd also like to thank the director

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,829
and the producer.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,390
What kind of beautiful dream is she having?

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,920
It's not a beautiful dream.

58
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,430
Xu Xiaocheng!

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,190
Don't wake her up.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,910
Or she might ask you to give her Oscar statue back to her.

61
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,040
Why are you still up?

62
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm having a dream too.

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,790
Who is it?

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,960
Someone who can save your life.

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,150
You?

66
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,600
It is debatable whether you can protect yourself or not.

67
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,270
You haven't heard me out yet.

68
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,790
How can you tell

69
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,550
if what I'm saying makes sense?

70
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,030
What's wrong?

71
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,670
Someone's outside the wall.

72
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,830
I nearly died.

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,650
The sound has disappeared.

74
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,490
It has happened again.

75
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,720
He really left this time, right?

76
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,170
What's the matter?

77
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,590
I saw a red eye.

78
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,630
- A red eye? - What happened?

79
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,870
Let's go check it out.

80
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,750
Gosh!

81
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,750
It's so big.

82
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,990
Fortunately, I sat up.

83
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,650
Otherwise, my head would've been cracked open.

84
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,150
I wasn't in breach of any taboo conditions.

85
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,610
Why would he try to kill me?

86
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,200
Whose egg is broken?

87
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,510
Mine.

88
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,390
When did it happen?

89
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,150
When we were on the seventh floor.

90
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

91
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,070
You didn't sleep because you knew he'd attempt to kill you, right?

92
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,070
It was meaningless to tell you that.

93
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,550
Now your egg is broken.

94
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,830
He'll keep trying to hunt you down.

95
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,690
We've gotta knock him down first!

96
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,790
Like what Zhang Xinghuo did?

97
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,270
The Wizard can't be killed.

98
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,990
There must be a solution.

99
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,990
Yo.

100
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,150
You care that much about my life?

101
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,210
God knows why you're still in the mood for jokes.

102
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,790
Since that man is the Wizard,

103
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,310
the triplets must have been kidnapped and brought here,

104
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,670
like what happens in the tale of Fitcher's Bird.

105
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,430
They don't look like father and daughters at all.

106
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,190
That is to say, this place isn't the triplets' home.

107
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,270
This is not our home.

108
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,470
We wanna go home.

109
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,230
It's easy.

110
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,270
We can just ask the triplets.

111
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,370
How are we supposed to find those elusive children?

112
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,070
How could you ask me to play with a ball here in the middle of the night?

113
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,530
Don't you find it amusing?

114
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,630
Shouldn't you say "crazy" instead?

115
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,130
Don't you think you're saying too much crap?

116
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,270
Fine.

117
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,760
I'll play with the ball.

118
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,270
Xiaocheng, can't you look happier?

119
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,510
I...

120
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,909
How am I supposed to feel happy about it?

121
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,630
Can we play with you?

122
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,430
Sure.

123
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,670
But if we play here,

124
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,070
people will be disturbed.

125
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,800
Why don't we go somewhere else?

126
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,510
Are we really gonna treat the kids this way?

127
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,870
There's no room for mercy.

128
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,470
Step aside. Let me handle it.

129
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,690
Are we gonna play here?

130
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,830
Isn't it nice?

131
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,270
If it's really nice, why did you shut the door?

132
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,070
If I hadn't shut it, you might have run away, right?

133
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,690
Kids, don't be afraid.

134
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,310
We are good people.

135
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,630
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

136
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,490
You were captured and brought to this place, right?

137
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,110
We can't tell you about that.

138
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,350
If you don't tell us, how can we have fun together?

139
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,470
You still don't wanna say it?

140
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,840
Tell the truth now,

141
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,310
or I'll smash the eggs in your hands.

142
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,030
Will you let us go if we tell you the truth?

143
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,030
Yes.

144
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,520
We were caught and brought here by him.

145
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,870
Do you know him?

146
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,950
No.

147
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,430
But he said he knew us.

148
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,190
He is kind to us,

149
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,390
but he wouldn't let us leave this place.

150
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,250
He has asked us to play a game about protecting eggs.

151
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,960
He hasn't locked you up.

152
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,710
Why don't you make your own escape?

153
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,840
No one can go anywhere in the thick fog.

154
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,150
Why would he ask you to hold eggs in your mouths?

155
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,790
I don't know. He trains us every day,

156
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,830
emphasizing that someone will die if an egg breaks.

157
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,830
He was kidnapped by a bad guy when he was ten.

158
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,190
That bad guy forced him and his mother to hold eggs in their mouths.

159
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,670
The one who broke their egg would be killed.

160
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,630
Then, his mom's egg broke,

161
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,030
so the bad guy killed his mother.

162
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,120
He cried his heart out when he said this.

163
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,190
What we saw on the seventh floor

164
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,720
must be the Wizard's story.

165
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,990
Hmm.

166
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,310
Do you happen to know where the door is?

167
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,750
At first,

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,430
I meant for us to team up.

169
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,280
If you tell us where the door is,

170
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,960
we'll help you get rid of him

171
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,930
and take you out of this place.

172
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,960
But now it seems...

173
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,090
We know where it is!

174
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,910
The door is right over there.

175
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,750
You mean that storeroom?

176
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,390
Yes!

177
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,990
Can you let us go now?

178
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,320
He forbids us from being away for too long.

179
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,830
Thank you. See you next time.

180
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,630
You're so good at picking locks.

181
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,890
I have more skills than you think.

182
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,810
You stay put. It's dangerous inside.

183
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,350
They didn't lie to us. The door is right here.

184
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,030
Should we tell them?

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,910
Tian Yan, Zhong Chengjian, come in.

186
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,270
How did you know we were outside?

187
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,070
If I were you, I would do the same.

188
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
The taboo conditions are clear now.

189
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,050
When an egg breaks,

190
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
the Wizard will kill.

191
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,360
Protecting our eggs is the most important thing.

192
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,840
Now that we've found the door,

193
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,990
we can leave when we get the key to it.

194
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,390
It won't be easy to get the key.

195
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,920
The Wizard can't be killed.

196
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,110
Why can't he?

197
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,550
He is clearly a human,

198
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,230
not a ghost or a demon.

199
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,750
Ordinary approaches will surely fail.

200
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,830
If ordinary approaches won't work,

201
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,750
then what will?

202
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,260
Are we gonna let ourselves die here?

203
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,960
This is my very first door challenge,

204
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,470
and I'm already having such bad luck!

205
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,630
It's creepy as hell!

206
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,750
Calm down.

207
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,400
What if your egg breaks?

208
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,670
So, that's your new partner?

209
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,190
Let's go.

210
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,190
Go.

211
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,710
I'm feeling dozy.

212
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,270
Don't sleep tonight.

213
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,600
The Wizard will try to kill Zhu Meng again.

214
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,670
How about this?

215
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,190
We'll take turns to keep watch at night.

216
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,190
I'll sleep first.

217
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,830
I'll keep watch.

218
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,490
Such a careless young man.

219
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,310
Go to sleep, Xiaocheng.

220
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,550
Thank you, Lingling.

221
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,920
(One day)

222
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,860
(Before the Birthday Party)

223
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,030
Don't just sit there.

224
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Dig in.

225
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,470
Who put a needle in my bowl?

226
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,340
Was it you?

227
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,670
Are you...

228
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,920
Are you out of your mind?

229
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,510
Haven't you been allies for a long time?

230
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,030
If you wanna act stupid, just harm yourself,

231
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,070
not me!

232
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,430
The porridge had been placed in the bowls before we came in.

233
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,720
We each chose a random seat.

234
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,990
Who would've known you'd sit there?

235
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,270
Then who did this?

236
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
You were late.

237
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,280
So what if I was late?

238
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,350
Because you were late,

239
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,570
we all assumed that the seat should be yours.

240
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,910
Whoever did that must have targeted you.

241
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,670
Fine. Then come at me! Come at me!

242
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,910
Did you put that needle in my bowl?

243
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,990
What did you say?

244
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,650
I was asking if you had put that needle in my bowl!

245
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,630
- Sit down. - No way!

246
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,830
You all fear death, don't you?

247
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,520
Don't make rash decisions!

248
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,070
I'll stab you to death!

249
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm really gonna stab you to death!

250
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,830
What?

251
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,270
He can't kill until an egg is broken, can he?

252
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,640
My egg isn't broken yet.

253
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,350
It doesn't mean

254
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,510
I can't break your egg

255
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,910
before killing you, right?

256
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,830
I'm only 26 years old.

257
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,560
I haven't gotten a girlfriend yet.

258
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,200
Can you spare my life?

259
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,310
What did you say?

260
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,890
I asked if you could spare my life.

261
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,819
Haven't I told you not to break your eggs?

262
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,910
Haven't I told you not to break your eggs?

263
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,440
I don't want to play anymore. I want to go home.

264
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,859
Neither do I. I wanna go home too.

265
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,109
You're not going anywhere!

266
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,350
Take it.

267
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,910
Take it!

268
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,550
Time's up.

269
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,000
Go back to your room.

270
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,910
A-Am I safe now?

271
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,470
You're safe for now.

272
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,350
But given your recklessness,

273
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,610
it's only a matter of time before you die.

274
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,630
The Wizard seems to have a different attitude

275
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,710
towards the triplets.

276
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,870
J-Just like our fingers, which vary in length,

277
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,530
it is common for people to treat others with different attitudes.

278
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,070
Have we missed

279
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,470
the key clue in the tale of Fitcher's Bird?

280
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,470
Though knives and guns can't hurt him,

281
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,750
I just noticed

282
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,830
a new burn scar on his hand.

283
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,330
I guess his hand was burned as he was cooking.

284
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,850
Maybe he's afraid of fire.

285
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,670
That's right!

286
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,110
The book says that the Wizard was burned to death in the end.

287
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,270
That's a lead!

288
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,830
At least, it proves

289
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,920
he's not a man without weaknesses.

290
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,270
The birthday party will be held tomorrow.

291
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,260
Let's give it a try at that time.

292
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,960
Okay.

293
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,350
Try... it out with our lives?

294
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,050
You should be glad that you're alive now.

295
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,440
This door challenge is quite odd, isn't it?

296
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,750
It seems simple.

297
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,590
We managed to figure out the Wizard's story

298
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,250
on the seventh floor quickly,

299
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,550
and correctly deduced

300
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,010
that breaking our eggs is a taboo condition.

301
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,830
But now, with all these clues,

302
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,050
this door doesn't seem simple at all.

303
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,310
Are you wondering

304
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,670
why the triplets always ask us to tell them apart?

305
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,670
Yeah.

306
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,350
According to the tale of Fitcher's Bird,

307
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,680
we know for sure that the Wizard has the key

308
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,630
to the door that we've found.

309
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,530
What on earth is wrong with the triplets?

310
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,750
Even the information about the door

311
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,410
was provided by the triplets.

312
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,590
Many things

313
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,990
can be explained by common sense,

314
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,720
but sometimes our thinking is also limited by it.

315
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,270
I know.

316
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,470
I'm just afraid

317
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,350
that the idea that fire can kill the Wizard

318
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,910
is a sort of common sense that limits our thinking.

319
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,390
What if fire can't hurt the Wizard?

320
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,790
Anyway, many tales end

321
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,570
with monsters being burned to death by fire.

322
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,030
Common sense...

323
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,130
Are we gonna believe our common sense or not?

324
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,550
Stop with all that thinking.

325
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,080
Let's get some sleep first.

326
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,550
Why are you sleeping here?

327
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,130
Keep your egg safe.

328
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,190
Thank you.

329
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,110
Where is your egg?

330
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,390
Why do you ask?

331
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,510
This isn't my egg.

332
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
There should be a dark spot on my egg.

333
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,910
There you are.

334
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,350
Why are you sleeping here?

335
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,210
Keep your egg safe.

336
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Thank you.

337
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
So,

338
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,880
the person he has been trying to kill is me.

339
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,830
I thought switching our eggs

340
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,070
would make him come after me instead.

341
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,470
I didn't expect that he'd still target you.

342
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,530
This is so nerve-racking.

343
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,530
Take your egg back.

344
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,270
What are you doing?

345
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,030
It slipped.

346
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,030
Are you crazy?

347
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,750
This could have been eaten.

348
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
What a waste.

349
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,710
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you.

350
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,870
Are you taking care of me

351
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,870
just to get me to join Obsidian?

352
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,430
I think you're talented,

353
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,960
and I want to be your friend.

354
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,670
Not everyone gets to be my friend.

355
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,870
So, you entered the door just to help me, right?

356
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,390
Don't flatter yourself.

357
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,110
I did it for Xu Xiaocheng,

358
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,430
and you don't need to burden yourself

359
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,990
with so many moral constraints.

360
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,310
As the head of the door-passing organizations,

361
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,950
the spokesperson, an outstanding leader,

362
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,280
and a legendary figure,

363
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,870
I also have a responsibility to figure out

364
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,550
why the Fitcher's Bird,

365
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,970
despite being a low-level door, could kill so many people.

366
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,850
Have you found the answer?

367
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,590
Not yet.

368
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,120
So, aren't you feeling wronged

369
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,850
by being trapped here?

370
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,270
No.

371
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,270
I believe you

372
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,930
can lead everyone to find the door and the key

373
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,410
because I see a light in you

374
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,260
that others don't have.

375
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,630
Alright,

376
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,800
we will definitely get out of here.

377
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,200
I'll bring Chestnut

378
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,330
to find you at Obsidian later.

379
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,910
Agreed.

380
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,070
Today, as the best actress,

381
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,750
I have something to say.

382
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,100
(On the Day)

383
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,170
(Of the Birthday Party)

384
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,410
(Hotel)

385
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,400
Ruan, you're really bold.

386
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,950
I can't sleep at all.

387
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,510
I didn't sleep either.

388
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,590
So, do you think

389
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,790
my sleeping posture looks good,

390
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,790
or does Xu Xiaocheng's look better?

391
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,870
Both look good.

392
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,590
Let's go. Time's up.

393
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,230
Wait a minute.

394
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,510
Actress, why are you still putting on makeup at this hour?

395
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,440
Just in case I die, I want to be the most beautiful one.

396
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,270
Wait for me!

397
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,010
(Happy Birthday)

398
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,640
Wasn't it supposed to be the triplets' birthday?

399
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,530
Why is there only one person wearing a birthday hat?

400
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,990
Can't he even buy more birthday hats?

401
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,560
Thank you all for coming to their birthday party.

402
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,050
Please have a seat.

403
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,030
Happy birthday to you.

404
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,550
Happy birthday to you.

405
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,150
Happy birthday to you.

406
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,110
Happy birthday to you.

407
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,190
Do you not find his voice eerie,

408
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,390
as if he's at a funeral?

409
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,390
Let me sing too

410
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,430
and drown out his voice.

411
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,500
Happy birthday to you.

412
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,710
Happy birthday to you.

413
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:47,790
Happy birthday to you.

414
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,070
Make a wish.

415
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,390
Then

416
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,840
let's blow out the candles.

417
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710
Next,

418
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,640
let's cut the cake.

419
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,310
Have a piece.

420
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,950
OK.

421
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,270
Is this red velvet cake?

422
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,030
I don't know.

423
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,030
I'll eat.

424
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,150
Have some cake.

425
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,770
I don't want to eat.

426
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,150
Have some cake.

427
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,150
Pour it on.

428
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,670
Have some cake.

429
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,250
I don't want to eat.

430
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,510
Why won't you eat?

431
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,950
It's gonna take some time for me to tell you.

432
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,870
Is this the bones of Zeng Ruguo

433
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,480
and Zhang Xinghuo?

434
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,030
What do you mean?

435
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,750
Sorry, slick hand.

436
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,830
Drop my cake. You all need to die.

437
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,730
None of you can escape.

438
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,150
Did we make it?

439
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,710
Where is the key?

440
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,110
He can actually survive this.

441
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,350
He is really amazing.

442
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Today,

443
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,100
all of you will die.

444
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,110
W-W-What should we do?

445
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,570
Everyone, run in different directions.

446
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,510
Where do we run to?

447
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
Go downstairs.

448
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,230
Wait, wait.

449
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,510
He's gone.

450
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,480
He's not chasing us anymore. Something's not right.

451
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,390
Dare we go check out Room 720?

452
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,390
Let's go.

453
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,870
What is this?

454
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,470
Does he kill people when the egg breaks?

455
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,380
This is the Wizard's past.

456
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,210
That little boy is the Wizard.

457
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,470
2010.

458
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,150
This is 2010.

459
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,270
If this is 2010,

460
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,110
then the Wizard is 10 years old...

461
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,230
I'm only 40 years old.

462
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,920
It's not quite appropriate for you to call me "Old Bro," right?

463
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,750
It was 1985 on the 14th floor.

464
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,270
The Wizard said he was 40.

465
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,270
What's going on?

466
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,290
The timelines don't match up.

467
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,000
Could it be that the little boy is not him?

468
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,590
It should be him.

469
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,590
That face

470
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,080
has distinctive features at both 10 and 40.

471
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,270
What's going on?

472
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,870
I feel itchy as soon as I come in.

473
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,150
Lingling,

474
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,670
it seems that you've aged a few years.

475
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,350
Aged?

476
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,630
Yes.

477
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,310
The 14th floor is in the year 1985.

478
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,590
This is 2010.

479
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,070
We'll definitely age rapidly when we reach the seventh floor.

480
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,730
So, it seems like this building has 2 timelines.

481
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,230
No.

482
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,170
No, if there are only 2,

483
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,130
the Wizard couldn't be 40.

484
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,550
There must be a third one.

485
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,630
Let's go.

486
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,350
Time in this building is a mess.

487
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,070
Go to the first floor. The old lady's house.

488
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,070
Let's go.

489
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,429
Granny.

490
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,790
I've told you everything I know.

491
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,270
Granny, please don't play dumb.

492
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,389
I want to know if there was a murder

493
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,030
in Room 720 of this building.

494
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,989
Come in and talk.

495
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,550
Why is this in the year 2040?

496
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,790
Granny, there must be a mistake.

497
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,310
It's 2040 now.

498
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,960
This is the third timeline.

499
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,670
Granny, in which year did the murder happen?

500
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,190
2010.

501
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,350
Wait a moment.

502
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,660
(Egg Murder)

503
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190
It's him.

504
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,270
But he was not born in 1985.

505
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,390
Granny.

506
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,990
How is the man doing now?

507
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,870
He's not doing well.

508
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,880
He lives next door to me,

509
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,410
but I haven't seen him for a long time.

510
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,150
He's 40 now.

511
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,190
That's right.

512
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,770
Men will still act like children.

513
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,310
even though

514
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,670
they are middle-aged.

515
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,310
He's always playing with knives and stuff at home.

516
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,390
His knife skills should be quite good

517
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,710
now,

518
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,190
but unfortunately, he's living alone.

519
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,990
Are you single?

520
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,230
Granny.

521
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,400
Well, how long has it been since you last saw him?

522
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,470
It's been quite a while.

523
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,910
If you don't go out

524
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,030
before 12:35 p.m.,

525
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,590
the apartment door will open,

526
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:08,310
and dense fog will engulf everything here.

527
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,510
The murder occurred at 12:35.

528
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,760
No wonder Granny mentioned this specific time.

529
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,840
It's almost 12 o'clock.

530
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,220
Only half an hour left.

531
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,710
It's 2040 now,

532
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,840
which means the Wizard returned to 1985 from here.

533
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,830
He doesn't belong to that timeline,

534
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,510
so no matter what, we can't kill him.

535
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,510
Yes.

536
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,430
I suddenly have a bold idea

537
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,360
that can explain everything here.

538
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,990
You mean the time machine.

539
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,760
Yes.

540
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,630
Are you talking about the crazy man from 404?

541
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,490
Why are you here again?

542
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,990
Bro, I want to go back to the past

543
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,030
and start over.

544
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,990
I thought you didn't believe in it.

545
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,000
I believe it now.

546
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,710
I'm living a terrible life.

547
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,710
Please help me.

548
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,310
Now?

549
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,670
I don't have that concept.

550
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,350
Time means nothing to me.

551
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,800
Can we go inside and take a look?

552
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,290
Let me broaden your horizons.

553
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,070
This is in the year 2040.

554
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,450
Where's the time machine?

555
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,590
Come in.

556
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,910
Don't mess around anywhere.

557
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,750
Is the time machine

558
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,800
in bad shape?

559
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,590
I have been repairing it for six months. What do you think?

560
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,500
The man on the fourteenth floor

561
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
used it, right?

562
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,510
How did you know?

563
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,060
Have you seen him?

564
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Where is he?

565
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,550
It all started

566
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,550
about six months ago.
