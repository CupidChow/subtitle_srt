Wait. What's wrong?

This is just a beta game.

16
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,830
The version is unstable.

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
What's it called?

18
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,310
Translated, it's called "The Spi Realm".

19
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,310
It hasn't been released domestically.

20
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,440
And it's not possible to introduce it.

21
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,030

22
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,000
Boss,

23
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,370
can you get the official version?

24
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,040
You really think highly of me.

25
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,270
Do you know that many people who have played this game experience hallucinations?

26
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,950
Some of them even died.

27
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,230
Isn't it weird?

28
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,070
Yes.

29
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,310
In that case,

30
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,710
this game should be scrapped.

31
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,310
Otherwise, many players will be harmed.

32
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,190
That's how America is like.

33
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,310
Only for money.

34
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,650

I'm a professional

38
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,750
in designing virtual reality games.

39
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,990
I find the gaming experience of this game quite realistic.

40
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,230
I want to explore it myself.

41
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,310
Can you help me get the official version?

42
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,310
Please.

43
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,590
I can only try to help you find it.

44
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,630
If I find it, I'll give you a call.

45
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,550
Okay.

46
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,030
Let me have your phone number.

My last name is Cui. I'm Cui Zhengqin.

51
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,030
Got it. Here.

52
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,150
What are you doing? You hit someone and just walked away?

53
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,950
Is it wrong for me to catch you?

54
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,950
You hit someone. What are you doing?

55
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,030
I was riding over from there,

56
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,560
and you were still walking.

57
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,870
What are you doing?

58
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,510
What am I doing?

59
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,510
You hit someone, didn't you see?

60
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,470
I hit someone?

61
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,230
I was riding over from there...

62

Are you not feeling well?

I'm fine.

Be careful.

Stop talking nonsense.

80
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,290
She might be playing mahjong somewhere.

81
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,710
I'm seriously.

82
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,750
- I'm leaving. - Go.

Let me ask you,

87
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,710
did you drink again?

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,620

90
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
why did you resign so suddenly?

91
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,190
Do you know how hard it is to find a job?

93
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,070

95
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,830

96
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,630
Why should I apologize?

97
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,630

00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,150
Anyway, thank you.

193
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,190
You're dressed quite antiquely.

194
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,610
I'm modeling for a friend's Hanfu brand.

195
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,630
I just changed into these clothes

196
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,270
and got into this stupid game.

197
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,270
What?

198
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,490
It's your first time here, right?

199
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,070
Simply put,

200
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,970
once you've entered the game,

201
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,070
you can't leave here without clearing the game.

202
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,200
If the game is over here,

203
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,870
you will

204
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,070
die in the real world.

205
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,310
Are you saying

206
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,990
I've traveled into the game?

207
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,040
"Traveling" is a more common term.

208
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,510
The actual situation

209
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,370
is a bit more complicated.

210
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,510
Dude, I'm a game designer.

211
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,750
I do programming, you know?

212
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,670
I'm saying, you can make it more complicated

213
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,730
and complete as you want, I can get it.

214
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,840
You can understand.

215
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,570
But I can't explain it.

216
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,750
Don't worry.

217
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,910
It's dead.

218
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,930
But speaking of which,

219
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,510
I really have to thank you

220
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,830
for giving me such a good chance.

221
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,910
Chance?

222
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,750
You mean...

223
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,790
just now?

224
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,310
So, it looked like you were saving me,

225
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,210
but actually, you were guiding me, using me as bait,

226
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
to kill it?

227
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,630
That was my plan from the beginning.

228
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,490
So, you weren't really saving me.

229
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,330
From a utilitarian perspective,

230
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,550
I did use you.

231
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,570
But in terms of the result,

232
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,910
I did save you too.

233
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,280
If you can't even pass the first level,

234
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,680
it means you are not capable at all.

235
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,030
Even if someone saves you,

236
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,350
you won't survive tomorrow.

237
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,110
I saved you,

238
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,950
so I hope you're worth saving.

239
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,470
You make a good point.

240
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,230
I take it back.

241
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,320
Take what back?

242
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,680
What I said to thank you.

243
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,950
Welcome to the world inside the doors.

244
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
Dude.

245
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,440
You're injured.

246
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,390
Ouch.

247
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,590
What's wrong?

248
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,510
It was to save you.

249
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,630
Come on.

250
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,710
Let me carry you.

251
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,310
Don't bother.

252
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,030
I can manage.

253
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,990
Really?

254
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,150
Where are we going?

255
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,910
My name is Ruan Baijie.

256
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,830
What's your name?

257
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,150
I'm Ling Jiushi.

258
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,750
Baijie.

259
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,030
It sounds like a girl's name.

260
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,670
It's a fake name.

261
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,310
Is Ling Jiushi your real name?

262
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,310
Yes.

263
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,910
I take back what I said earlier.

264
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,910
You really won't survive tomorrow.

265
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,910
Huh?

266
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,990
Hey, dude.

267
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,130
What are you doing?

268
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,010
Asking him if he has any medicine.

269
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,710
Before knowing if they're friend or foe,

270
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,440
don't tell anyone I'm injured.

271
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,310
Okay.

272
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,310
Are you new here?

273
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah, sort of.

274
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,390
Let's go.

275
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,430
I'll tell you in the village.

276
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,830
So strong.

277
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,430
Just call me Xiong Qi.

278
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,610
It's my third time entering the door.

279
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,670
Nice to meet you.

280
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,670
I'm Ruan Baijie.

281
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,840
It's my fourth time.

282
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,230
You called me just now?

283
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,030
Yeah, it was me. I'm Ling Jiushi.

284
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,510
Why are you so excited? You're really new here.

285
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,920
Can you stop talking about your real name?

286
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,350
A true man never changes his name.

287
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,910
Those who think they are true men

288
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,510
will all die miserably in the end.

289
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,110
You just said how many times you've entered the door.

290
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,630
Is it how many times you've played this game?

291
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,550
Yeah.

292
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,430
Each time starts from entering the door.

293
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,030
I've played all the games on the market,

294
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,890
but why haven't I played this one?

295
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,590
Maybe

296
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,840
this isn't a game on the market.

297
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,190
Come on in.

298
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,470
You must be freezing.

299
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,910
Looks like

300
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,950
there are many newcomers today.

301
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,310
Great.

302
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,150
I hope there will be this many people tomorrow.

303
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,750
Help yourselves.

304
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,840
Let me explain the situation here.

305
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,870
This is my third time entering the door.

306
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,270
I come from the real world,

307
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,950
just like everyone else here.

308
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,240
We're going to live in the village for a while.

309
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,370
Everything will be fine once the problem is solved.

310
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
I guess

311
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,400
someone has already in danger.

312
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,500
I know it's hard to accept this,

313
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,990
but this game is really unusual.

314
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,030
If we get seriously injured or die here,

315
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,660
our life will also be in danger

316
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,520
when we get back to the real world.

317
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,280
I'm not trying to scare you.

318
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,630
Many of you are entering the door for the first time.

319
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,830
I'm telling you this

320
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,160
not because I'm kind-hearted,

321
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,870
but I don't want you to waste time.

322
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,870
Remember.

323
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,480
If you want to get out alive,

324
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,810
you must find the door and the key.

325
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,270
This...

326
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,570
This is not a dream.

327
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,510
I... I just went to the restaurant to pick up the food.

328
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,630
When I pushed the door of the restaurant,

329
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,490
I ended up here.

330
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,950
No, I have to go back.

331
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,670
Otherwise, my order will be overdue.

332
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,630
I need to go back. I need to go back.

333
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,630
I need to go back. I need to go back.

334
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,160
Come back! It's dangerous!

335
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,280
Come back! It's dangerous!

336
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,350
Ghost!

337
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,910
Darn it.

338
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,500
What was that just now?

339
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,610
That's the Door Ghost.

340
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,880
You can't leave unless you defeat her.

341
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,190
What about the wolf?

342
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,990
That's a gift.

343
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

344
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,750
Do I have to tell you everything?

345
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,350
I've seen too much here.

346
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,750
Here,

347
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,190
we must work together.

348
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,430
If we each go our own way, we'll be defeated one by one.

349
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
My name is Ke.

350
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,880
What are your names?

351
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,350
I'm Cheng Wen. It's my second time here.

352
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,200
I'm Wang Xiaoyi.

353
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,310
This is my first time.

354
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,070
I want to go home.

355
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,240
Don't try to escape again.

356
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,350
Take the key and go back.

357
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,030
Ke.

358
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,950
Do we have to use strategy or fight

359
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,630
to find a way out of here?

360
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,870
Not necessarily.

361
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,510
But behind every door

362
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,690
is the same danger.

363
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,510
You must find the key first

364
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,310
and the door

365
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,920
to return to the real world.

366
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,950
Can I follow you?

367
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,710
Excuse me.

368
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,380
Is there a room available?

369
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,920
I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

370
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,030
You still have the mood to sleep?

371
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,710
If you don't sleep, you won't die?

372
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
All right.

373
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,340
There are rooms upstairs.

374
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,350
Help yourselves.

375
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,750
We?

376
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,520
Aren't you in the same group?

377
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,440
This is really another dimension.

378
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,350
Each door leads to a different time and space.

379
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,430
There's modern, ancient,

380
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,240
and even the future.

381
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,740
This is an escape room where people can die.

382
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,720
You can understand it that way.

383
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Why lock the door?

384
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm afraid others will know that you're injured.

385
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,310
I'm fine.

386
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,750
I won't die.

387
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,870
Don't touch me.

388
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,620
Why did you team up with me?

389
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,870
I thought

390
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,240
at least you wouldn't hold me back.

391
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,110
What do you mean?

392
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,790
What? Don't you agree?

393
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,990
I haven't tested you yet.

394
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,350
People like you

395
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,070
only care about the result when playing games.

396
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,530
Then why do you play games?

397
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,270
If the result is life and death,

398
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,270
then the result is everything.

399
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,350
This place

400
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,150
is not for people who fond of bravery and fighting.

401
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,270
As for me,

402
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,270
I just want to go back on my own.

403
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,090
Whether I team up or not

404
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,630
or whom to team up with,

405
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,160
it doesn't matter.

406
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,750
You not only have good hearing

407
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,070
but also are a hot temper.

408
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,990
I find you have good eyesight too.

409
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,160
One has sharp ears, the other has keen eyesight.

410
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,190
A perfect match.

411
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,150
A match for what?

412
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,150
Partners.

413
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,920
You're sleeping already?

414
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,320
You have such a big heart.

415
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,680
What stupid window?

416
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,430
What are you doing so late at night?

417
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,670
Why are you standing there?

418
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,390
Stop playing.

419
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,710
I am a determined materialist.

420
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,990
I am a determined materialist.

421
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,090
What are you doing?

422
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,750
I am a determined materialist.

423
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,550
Okay, I got it.

424
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,190
I am a determined materialist.

425
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,390
Are you done?

426
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,790
I am a determined materialist.

427
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,830
I am a determined materialist.

428
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,940
If you are so determined,

429
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,840
why don't you invite her out?

430
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,430
I am a...

431
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,340
a materialist who is less committed.

432
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Run!

433
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,110
That ghost,

434
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,810
why didn't she chase after us?

435
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,150
The monster inside the door

436
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,750
won't kill people randomly.

437
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,790
Why?

438
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,010
I'll tell you if you beg me.

439
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,510
There's a rock at the mouth of the well.

440
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,200
The well is well-built.

441
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,050
You know feng shui?

442
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,010
I've learned a little.

443
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,070
What about you?

444
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,070
What do you do?

445
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,430
I'm a programmer.

446
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,950
Before this,

447
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,310
I've been working as a virtual reality architect.

448
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,550
You have so much hair.

449
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,190
Haven't worked for long, right?

450
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,190
Guess what I do.

451
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,550
Not interested.

452
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,990
Take a guess.

453
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,830
I'll tell you if you guess right.

454
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,990
Now I see.

455
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,040
All your saying about "I wouldn't hold you back".

456
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,390
Actually,

457
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,070
you only know one move,

458
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,430
run.

459
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,510
I can run too.

460
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,270
Where are you going? It's warm here.

461
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,850
You're too boring.

462
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,440
I'll go upstairs and sleep with the ghost.

463
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,910
Don't go. I'm hungry.

464
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,910
Make me a bowl of noodles.

465
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,440
I'll protect you next time.

466
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,790
It's not for free.

467
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,550
How is your cooking?

468
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,500
It won't kill you.

469
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,150
Don't hurt me again.

470
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,910
No, I won't.

471
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,430
Watch the pot.

472
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,880
Where are you going?

473
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,510
Here.

474
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,870
Where did you get it?

475
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,199
From the receptionist.

476
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,469
You look cold

477
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:25,800
and coughed a few times.

478
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,350
Thank you.

479
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,190
I don't know if it's dirty.

480
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,449
Actually, as you said,

481
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,370
it doesn't matter if it's clean or not in this world.

482
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,810
You're a good student.

483
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,810
The noodles are almost ready.

484
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,920
Who lives in the room upstairs?

485
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,710
I don't know.

486
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,910
Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

487
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,750
How could he die?

488
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,790
This, this is too tragic.

489
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,550
It's starting.

490
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,110
I thought the first one would be...

491
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Forget it.

492
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,350
You thought it would be the two of us, right?

493
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,750
You had such high expectations for us.

494
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,230
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

495
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,790
Dead and out.

496
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,350
I heard a strange sound.

497
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,050
So it was that monster eating him.

498
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,190
What?

499
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,590
I'm done playing. I want to go back.

500
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,350
Yes, I want to go back.

501
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,510
You think you can leave just because you want to?

502
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,970
He must have violated the taboo conditions.

503
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,470
Remember,

504
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,270
you must find out what the taboo conditions are

505
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,270
to stay alive.

506
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,990
Be careful

507
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,470
until you find out.

508
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,790
He died by the railing alone.

509
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,510
Don't go near the railing alone.

510
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,030
I see.

511
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,950
What were you muttering?

512
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,360
Nothing.

513
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,790
I don't want to die.

514
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
What does the taboo conditions

515
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,830
mean that Xiong Qi just said?

516
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,040
The noodles are still warm, let's talk while eating.

517
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,350
What taboo conditions?

518
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,110
I don't want to die.

519
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,390
I don't want to die.

520
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,510
The monster inside the door kills people

521
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,670
based on the certain taboo conditions.

522
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,230
Once people who enter the door break the rules

523
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,550
and trigger these taboos,

524
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,810
the monster will come.

525
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,910
On the contrary,

526
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,870
if you don't break the rules, you'll be safe for now.

527
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,510
So the taboo conditions can't be violated.

528
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,510
Hmm.

529
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,160
The higher the difficulty level inside the door,

530
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,830
the more extensive the taboo conditions will be.

531
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,870
Some taboos

532
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,910
are even hard to understand.

533
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,310
For example?

534
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,670
For example...

535
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,150
For example,

536
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,560
it will kill people wearing shoes.

537
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,550
Just an example.

538
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,230
Maybe

539
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,040
it will kill people without shoes.

540
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,470
Nice noodles.

541
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,710
So... yesterday I violated a taboo condition?

542
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,930
No, therwise you would have died earlier.

543
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,070
Both of you,

544
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,130
the patriarch wants to see us.

545
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,430
The patriarch is

546
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,750
a NPC inside the door

547
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,970
who assigns tasks.

548
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,990
There's a NPC?

549
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,190
Let's go.

550
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,680
Is it controlled by the system?

551
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,210
Is it a real person?

552
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,550
How's it programmed?

553
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,750
I'm the patriarch here.

554
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,230
You must be the ones I invited to help, right?

555
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,590
Sort of.

556
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,790
Follow me.

557
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,150
So there was a wolf disaster in the village.

558
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,830
It's getting cold.

559
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,310
I want to make a coffin.

560
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,350
It's urgent.

561
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,150
So I'd like

562
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,190
you to help the carpenters here.

563
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,950
Be careful.

564
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,060
There's a monster here.

565
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,550
