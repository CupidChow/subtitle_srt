00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,310
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,920
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,270
You're awake.

4
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,040
What happened to me?

5
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,240
Brain concussion and soft tissue injury.

6
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,510
You almost had to stay in the ICU.

7
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,910
But we got a book back.

8
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,590
A book back?

9
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,329
It's really a book.

10
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,390
The props inside the door can't usually be brought into the real world.

11
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,510
What can be brought back to the real world

12
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,170
must have specific purposes.

13
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,270
Is there anything special about it?

14
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,680
We don't know it yet.

15
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,870
You brought the prop out.

16
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
You keep it.

17
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,270
Okay.

18
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,970
Let me show you another thing.

19
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,200
This is You's phone.

20
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,470
I knew something was off about her inside the door.

21
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,390
Look at her album.

22
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,110
She was taking pictures of us secretly.

23
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
Keep swiping.

24
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,110
There is someone we know.

25
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,510
How did they know each other?

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,950
Maybe they came from the same organization

27
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,070
that we don't know.

28
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,840
That's a bit creepy.

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,780
You've passed the fifth door.

30
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,230
The next door will be in two months.

31
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,110
You need to recover quickly.

32
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,430
Your injury was unexpected.

33
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,230
I had other plans.

34
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,470
It seems I have to postpone them.

35
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,510
What plans?

36
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,390
Let's talk about it some other time.

37
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,720
If you don't get better,

38
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,350
the plans will be out of the picture.

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,400
Your health is more important.

40
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Have a good rest.

41
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,190
Ruan.

42
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,470
You've grown up.

43
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't come visit a patient empty-handed.

44
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,310
I have some juicy gossip.

45
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,510
Do you want to hear it?

46
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,190
Juicy gossip?

47
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,870
You sure?

48
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,510
It's fresh, and I'm sure.

49
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,230
Obsidian has a new guy.

50
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,390
You failed too.

51
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,510
Ling Jiushi and Ruan Lanzhu from the Obsidian

52
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,670
have their ways again.

53
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
Yes.

54
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,070
- But we have... - They are something.

55
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,270
Ruan Lanzhu is indeed outstanding.

56
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,950
But...

57
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,230
Since he is a talent,

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,360
we don't have to compete with him.

59
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,670
We can work with him.

60
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,270
Cooperation?

61
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,670
Since you can't pass,

62
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,750
find someone who can pass.

63
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,650
Time is the most precious thing to me.

64
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,870
Mr. Danny is already a little upset.

65
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,190
Make an offer to them.

66
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,750
Make them my men.

67
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,310
I'm afraid they won't agree.

68
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,970
You haven't talked to them yet. How do you know that?

69
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,310
Give them an offer

70
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,270
that they can't refuse.

71
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
Yes.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Chestnut.

73
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,400
Are you feeling better?

74
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,190
Yes.

75
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
Chestnut.

76
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,790
Why don't you touch the butt of Toast

77
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,330
and relieve yourself?

78
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,160
Are you comforted?

79
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,940
(Wu Qi)

80
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,070
Hello.

81
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,070
You finally answered my call.

82
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,230
Are you controlled by a pyramid scheme?

83
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:26,990
No.

84
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,230
Where did you hear that gossip?

85
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,040
You are too kind

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
and gullible.

87
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,670
Well, I have to see you.

88
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,159
I can call the police if anything happens,

89
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,909
and save you from the predicament.

90
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,070
- No, I... - You know what?

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,430
I saw the news.

92
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,350
Those who were defrauded by pyramid schemes are miserable.

93
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm worried about you.

94
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,470
I'm going to see you now.

95
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,630
Send me your address.

96
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,430
- Stop it. - I...

97
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,950
Hello?

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,030
He hung up.

99
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,430
Well,

100
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
can I bring a friend here?

101
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,670
Sure.

102
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,230
But I suggest you don't tell him anything about the game,

103
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,190
if you don't want to be locked up in a mental hospital.

104
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,010
That happened before.

105
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,590
Not long after Yi Manman, the one who sat here just now,

106
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,790
moved into the villa,

107
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,980
he told everything to his family.

108
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,830
My family once thought

109
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,360
we were a pyramid scheme.

110
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,250
To prevent him from going astray,

111
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,030
they sent Yi Manman to a mental hospital.

112
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,630
In the end, I managed to get him out.

113
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,550
Then, I have to think about

114
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,470
how to explain to him.

115
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,690
Aren't you going to explain to your parents?

116
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,608
No need.

117
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
We're not that close.

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Chestnut.

119
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
Chestnut.

120
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
Chestnut.

121
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,350
Isn't it large?

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,110
Everyone, let me introduce

123
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,190
my best friend, Wu Qi, to you.

124
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,200
What took you so long to bring him here?

125
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,310
Our business

126
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,990
is to absorb new members.

127
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,550
Come on.

128
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,030
Let me tell you

129
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,510
all our businesses.

130
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,350
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,410
I forgot to take the foolish boy away.

132
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,750
Be gentle.

133
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,150
He's young. Just kidding.

134
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,190
He's immature.

135
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,270
Have a seat.

136
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,310
Let me introduce.

137
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,669
This is Yi Manman.

138
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,070
The one with glasses is Chen Fei.

139
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,590
Don't you have classes here?

140
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,470
It's not a pyramid scheme.

141
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,270
Then why didn't you contact me for more than a month?

142
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,710
I...

143
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,380
I was sick and convalesced for a while.

144
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Sick?

145
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,160
What was wrong with you?

146
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,430
What the hell?

147
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,610
Do you still regard me as your friend?

148
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,150
I got sick suddenly

149
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,510
and didn't want you to worry about me.

150
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,110
I worried about you a lot. I'm still in fear now.

151
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,390
Ruan.

152
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,350
A newbie?

153
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,510
Zhuang Rujiao.

154
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,630
Give her a lesson.

155
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,110
Didn't you say there is no class here?

156
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,270
Ruan Lanzhu.

157
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,670
Wu Qi.

158
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,570
I'm Ling Jiushi's friend.

159
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,820
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

160
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,090
If you have spare time,

161
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,850
welcome to visit us often.

162
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,310
Okay.

163
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,000
I believe you aren't doing a pyramid scheme here.

164
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,190
That's it? Do you believe what I said?

165
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,190
Hey.

166
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,910
He's handsome.

167
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,920
He must be a star in any industry with his appearance.

168
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,510
You mean I'm ugly, huh?

169
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,590
No. No.

170
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,950
Alright.

171
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm relieved that you're okay.

172
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,230
But remember it.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,870
Call me if anything happens.

174
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,830
We are friends.

175
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,880
Don't worry.

176
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,150
I will.

177
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,430
Alright, I'll go to work.

178
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,470
Let's go.

179
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,390
Let's go. I'll see you off.

180
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,350
I stayed at home that day.

181
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,830
Suddenly, a door appeared in front of me.

182
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,110
Then I pulled the door,

183
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,830
and felt like

184
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,160
coming into a new world.

185
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,070
What's going on?

186
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,030
Here's the thing.

187
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,670
There are 12 doors

188
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,310
in the Spi Realm.

189
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,230
See you.

190
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,430
Wu Qi is one of my few friends.

191
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,270
You'll make more friends here.

192
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,380
It's not that difficult.

193
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,230
It's not a battle royal.

194
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,230
That newbie

195
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,850
passed the first door?

196
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,850
I helped her pass the second door.

197
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,150
You've been entering the game quite frequently.

198
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,830
Is it related to the 11th door?

199
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,070
As a rookie,

200
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,920
your primary goal is to pass the first five doors.

201
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,470
The main business of Obsidian is to

202
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,830
help newbies like you

203
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,070
to pass the first five doors.

204
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,270
The first five doors?

205
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,670
Which door was the one I passed last time?

206
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,430
Fei, I still want to know

207
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,070
the details of how our team...

208
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,790
Zhuang has a pleasant name.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,590
What?

210
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,670
I don't like her at all.

211
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,430
Why?

212
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,270
Didn't you notice that? After she came,

213
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,030
Ruan only helped her pass the doors.

214
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,590
He took her to pass the doors three or four times a week,

215
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,920
and totally ignored us.

216
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,950
Maybe he's training the newbie.

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,640
Do you think so, too?

218
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,910
Do you

219
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,070
want to go into the doors frequently?

220
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,600
Are you not afraid anymore?

221
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,920
Morning, Lingling.

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,070
Hey. Morning.

223
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,070
Morning, bro.

224
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,350
Lingling,

225
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,620
I've been here for a long time.

226
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,070
Why didn't I meet anyone else?

227
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,550
Anyone else?

228
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,910
What do you mean?

229
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,000
Lu is the only girl here.

230
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,360
I wonder whether there are other girls in our organization.

231
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
Other girls?

232
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,310
Some might have been here.

233
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,830
But I'm a newbie. I don't know much about this.

234
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,510
Okay.

235
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,270
Ruan took me to see other members yesterday.

236
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,670
Recently,

237
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,940
I've met a lot of people.

238
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,630
I'm just curious

239
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,400
how many people are in our team.

240
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,790
Well...

241
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,150
I...

242
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,670
I don't know.

243
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,570
You can inquire about others.

244
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,790
Take your time.

245
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,670
Morning, Zhuang.

246
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,750
Morning.

247
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,910
Zhuang,

248
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,550
as a rookie,

249
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
you adapted well.

250
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,210
I have faith in you.

251
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,430
Fei,

252
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,730
I remember you said the same words

253
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,050
when I first came here.

254
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,330
I think more highly of you.

255
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,840
But Zhuang is prettier.

256
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,310
That's true.

257
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,230
Are you jealous?

258
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,630
Jealous?

259
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,310
No.

260
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610
Why would I be jealous?

261
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,190
I mean

262
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,270
Ruan.

263
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,910
Ruan has concentrated all his attention

264
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,110
on Zhuang,

265
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,830
the newbie.

266
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,870
Don't you feel upset?

267
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,190
No matter passing the door,

268
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,390
or knowing him,

269
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,630
you came first.

270
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,070
Bro,

271
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,480
this is not a relationship that

272
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,810
has the rule "first come, first served".

273
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,070
You...

274
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,600
Aren't you jealous?

275
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,710
If you ask this again,

276
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll call your brother over

277
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,310
to teach you a lesson.

278
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,350
See you.

279
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,710
What a strange idea the young man has!

280
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,510
Fei, you passed so many doors.

281
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,710
Have you seen a pretty girl

282
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,350
in a white dress?

283
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,390
Have you?

284
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,550
No.

285
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,510
You must have seen

286
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,150
many beauties in the doors.

287
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,590
Hang in there.

288
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,710
What?

289
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,000
There is a week left.

290
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,350
It'll be soon.

291
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,710
Seven days later. What's wrong?

292
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,510
Put it on.

293
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,720
(Clinic)

294
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,310
Hey.

295
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,510
Why do you bring me to the hospital?

296
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,510
To see a patient.

297
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,510
Is Ruan Lanzhu injured?

298
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,240
Don't worry.

299
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,550
It's Zhuang Rujiao who was hospitalized.

300
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,430
Ruan Lanzhu was severely injured last time.

301
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,150
You managed to handle it.

302
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,470
Why can't you handle it this time?

303
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,470
It's different.

304
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,310
I didn't try to treat her this time.at all.

305
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,510
I sent her to the hospital directly.

306
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,510
Why?

307
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,110
I can't expose my real strength.

308
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,670
She's a newbie.

309
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,110
What do you mean?

310
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,960
Forget it. Nothing.

311
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,770
Just one more week.

312
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
It's almost done.

313
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,710
What will happen in a week?

314
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,030
Earth explosion?

315
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,690
Strictly speaking, there are six days left.

316
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,290
Alright, stop asking.

317
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,589
You'll know when the time comes.

318
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,674
Eat more.

319
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,890
Refined carbohydrates. It can replenish your energy.

320
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,630
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

321
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,950
Eat one more.

322
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,970
Seeing your smile,

323
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,090
I know you've recovered well.

324
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,110
Here.

325
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,270
Eat more fruits.

326
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,970
You're the fastest-growing newbie I've ever seen.

327
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,060
By the way,

328
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,170
Roman was not built in one day.

329
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,070
If you can't stand it,

330
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,990
just tell Ruan.

331
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,150
It is a necessary stage for newbies,

332
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,430
but Ruan would like to show pity and care for women.

333
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,760
You can take a shortcut.

334
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,110
Well.

335
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,150
It's okay.

336
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,110
I'll try my best to keep up with Ruan

337
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,750
and try to be a key figure in our team

338
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
as soon as possible.

339
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,790
There's a reason for your progress.

340
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,390
We haven't seen

341
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,830
such a high-quality newbie like you for a long time.

342
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,060
You must be the backbone of our team.

343
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,110
Am I right?

344
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Yes.

345
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,440
You're much better than me.

346
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,030
When you are discharged,

347
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,710
I'll make you a good meal.

348
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,270
What about me?

349
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,880
Let's have a meal together.

350
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,150
Are you done?

351
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,670
Let's have food.

352
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,560
Where's Zhuang RuJiao?

353
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,070
I've cooked so many dishes for her.

354
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,070
Where is she?

355
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,490
She ran away last night.

356
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,950
Ran away?

357
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,310
- What do you mean? - Just what I said.

358
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,310
She couldn't stand Ruan's oppression,

359
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,310
and ran away.

360
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,030
Actually, she works for the White Deer.

361
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,030
She is

362
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,510
a spy

363
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,770
who came to work for us.

364
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,750
What was her purpose?

365
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,610
She came here to look for someone.

366
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,190
Baijie?

367
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,240
So you've already known it?

368
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,400
If we could not find it out,

369
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,390
we are too stupid.

370
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,930
So Ruan made a counterplot

371
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,110
to exploit her.

372
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,110
Few people could stand Ruan's oppression.

373
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,150
Later, Zhuang Rujiao found that she couldn't find Baijie,

374
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,630
and was exploited.

375
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,510
She realized something was wrong,

376
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,440
so she ran away after stealing a box from Ruan's room.

377
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,510
I hope she won't believe

378
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,260
the note in the box is real.

379
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,710
It's even with their fake keys.

380
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Well.

381
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,790
If that's the case,

382
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,530
why didn't you tell me?

383
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,630
You all acted so happily.

384
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,400
Because you are too clumsy to coordinate with us.

385
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,580
What?

386
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,240
Do you disagree with my words?

387
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,310
You didn't tell me anything.

388
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,140
You're so mean.

389
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,070
(Li Dongyuan)

390
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,430
Shame on you!

391
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,790
Baijie is here.

392
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,870
That's good.

393
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,670
I'll be right there.

394
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,150
Can I meet her later?

395
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,070
Baijie is my type.

396
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,870
Baijie doesn't like

397
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,870
men who talked too much.

398
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,870
Bye.

399
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,070
Li Dongyuan

400
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,070
likes Baijie?

401
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,590
Yes?

402
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,360
Isn't Baijie good?

403
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,710
She is indeed good.

404
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,430
Who is better,

405
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,910
Baijie or me?

406
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,880
But you are the same person.

407
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,830
I'm going to help a client pass the next door.

408
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,830
It's almost time.

409
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,070
Come in with me.

410
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,510
I...

411
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,830
Can I?

412
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,790
I'll be a burden.

413
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,990
You've almost recovered.

414
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,920
You need to practice to pass the doors.

415
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,190
Wouldn't it have a grudge against the White Deer?

416
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,190
We have Baijie.

417
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,360
Li Dongyuan is eager to collaborate with us.

418
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,430
Who is it?

419
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,710
Bro.

420
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,390
Where is Baijie?

421
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,760
Let's get down to business.

422
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,110
Are you nervous?

423
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm not nervous.

424
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,320
Why are you nervous?

425
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,630
I feel the deadline is approaching.

426
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,360
Your next door is the sixth one, right?

427
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,230
Yes, the sixth door.

428
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,110
But I don't feel that way.

429
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,990
It's your fate, after all.

430
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,550
You can't escape.

431
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,170
You are indeed more suitable than Yi Manman.

432
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,910
For what?

433
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,110
I mean

434
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
as a rookie,

435
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,440
you're better than him.

436
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,510
No.

437
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,310
You are better.

438
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,030
Everyone can accumulate experience,

439
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,230
but not everyone has a strong psychological quality

440
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,430
and can stay calm in the worlds of doors.

441
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,310
Ruan is lucky

442
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,280
to meet a newcomer like you.

443
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,240
Would anyone feel uneasy about the doors?

444
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,830
Too many.

445
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,770
This game is not merciful.

446
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,750
It's to make people anxious.

447
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,110
Ruan Lanzhu,

448
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,280
you must keep your promise.

449
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,950
Is Baijie back?

450
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,200
See you in the next door.

451
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,200
Don't forget what you promised me.

452
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,470
Go away!

453
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,270
Cheapskate.

454
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,830
Ruan, how is it?

455
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,270
Did he hit you?

456
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,370
He wants to cooperate with us.

457
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,750
He's willing to share information.

458
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,430
Of course, there's a condition.

459
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,750
He wants to take tasks with Ruan Baijie.

460
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,950
At least once a month.

461
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,310
Is he out of his mind?

462
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,350
There's no Baijie at all.

463
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,800
Go with me for Li Dongyuan's cooperation.

464
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,310
I need you to pass the door more often.

465
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,390
What about Baijie?

466
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,150
We'll see.

467
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,200
Why does he like Baijie so much?

468
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,870
If you don't know that Baijie is Ruan,

469
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,450
wouldn't you like her?

470
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,630
I...

471
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,310
Think about it.

472
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,190
What about you?

473
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,870
Pack up

474
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,300
and meet a client with me.

475
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,990
You need to know the rules of the doors.

476
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,110
Long,

477
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,790
as long as I can be with you,

478
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't care if I'll be a famous artist.

479
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,880
From now on, I'll sign your name on all my paintings.

480
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

481
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,550
I don't care about art.

482
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,190
My paintings are your paintings.

483
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,990
I only care

484
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,110
if what we have is love.

485
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,070
Give me an answer!

486
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,070
1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

487
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,020
Oh.

488
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,790
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

489
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,630
Cut!

490
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,630
Cut!

491
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,390
Director, let's stop here.

492
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,550
Liu!

493
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,550
Clapperboard!

494
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,600
Scene 3, frame 6, take 9.

495
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,230
What's wrong, Miss, Mister?

496
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,870
Everything was fine.

497
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,550
Long, pull yourself together, alright?

498
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,430
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,390
I miscounted the numbers.

500
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,000
4 is followed by 5, not 6.

501
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,630
Let's do it one more time.

502
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,830
Miss Zaozao, thank you for your hard work.

503
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,070
Long, you'll do one more take alone.

504
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,530
Miss Zaozao, you can get off work now.

505
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,390
Miss Zaozao, this way please.

506
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,850
Miss Zaozao, don't be mad.

507
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,990
What a crazy guy!

508
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,990
How could he miscount those simple numbers?

509
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,110
He doesn't respect this profession at all.

510
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,710
How maddening!

511
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,070
Alright. Miss Zaozao, don't be upset.

512
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,550
Get ready! We'll do one more take!

513
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,550
Okay, Director!

514
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,870
Come on! Time to work!

515
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,910
Oh, here I am.

516
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,750
My friends are in front of us.

517
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,710
They are with me.

518
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,710
Yes.

519
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,830
Gentlemen, this way.

520
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,810
Miss Zaozao, your make-up's done.

521
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,990
I have something important to discuss with my friends.

522
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,230
I need you to stay out there for a moment.

523
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,830
Do not let anyone disturb me.

524
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,020
Okay, Miss Zaozao.

525
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,470
It turns out that she's Xu Xiaocheng.

526
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,350
She's so different from what she's like in the door challenges.

527
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,430
I've told you

528
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,430
that either the one in the door challenges or the one out is real.

529
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,430
Oh.

530
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,190
Ruan.

531
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,470
Seriously,

532
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,070
don't you wanna start a career in the entertainment industry?

533
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,400
Even if I do that, you'll still turn to me for help, won't you?

534
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,090
You're totally different from your image in the door challenges.

535
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,830
That's just a persona.

536
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
I have no choice.

537
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,430
Being a star is just a job.

538
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,750
Today, I've also found you cuter than you are in the door challenges.

539
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,670
Thank you.

540
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm taking him with me to the next door challenge.

541
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,190
Are you okay with it?

542
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,350
If you're okay with it,

543
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,830
I'm certainly okay with it as well.

544
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,230
Plus, Lingling is great.

545
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,880
It's a delight to work with you.

546
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,590
Lingling, you seem quite young.

547
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,270
Can I interest you in a job as my assistant?

548
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,260
Don't you already have an assistant?

549
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,120
She's by no means as good as you are.

550
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,490
I've seen how wonderful you are in the door challenges.

551
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,630
Well, you're leading a busy life.

552
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,510
How do you find time to play the Spi Realm?

553
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,990
Well... that's a long story.

554
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,230
Do you think stars enjoy lots of freedom?

555
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,670
Sometimes we do things against our will.

556
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,670
An investor

557
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,190
planned to adapt this game into a movie.

558
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,630
I wanted to familiarize myself with it,

559
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,880
but ended up in trouble unexpectedly.

560
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,830
Listen,

561
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,680
please do take my offer under consideration.

562
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,190
What are your hobbies?

563
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,520
For example, watching movies?

564
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,590
I can take you to premieres, film festivals,

565
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,920
and all sorts of events!

566
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,590
We're simply working as partners.

567
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,990
No need to ask so many questions.

568
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,230
Aren't we friends?

569
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,830
I'm having a nice talk with Lingling

570
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,160
just because I want to know more about him.

571
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,360
That's unnecessary.

572
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,200
Ruan, aren't you being too petty?

573
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,590
Just focus on solving the door challenges.

574
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,720
If you want to survive, you'd better be smart and strong.

575
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,010
Your acting skills can't save your life.

576
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,030
I'll die eventually.

577
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,710
Why don't I channel my energy into doing something I enjoy?

578
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,510
Brace yourself for the next door challenge.

579
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,040
This time, it'll be a White Tiger door about physical strength.

580
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,030
Oh!

581
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,510
I forgot my bracelet.

582
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,190
Actually, we don't usually meet with our clients.

583
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,630
But Tan Zaozao was referred to me by an acquaintance.

584
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,270
Besides, she has a special identity,

585
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,310
so we have to meet her in real life.

586
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,430
If two people don't meet up in advance,

587
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,890
how are they supposed to enter the same door?

588
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,540
Didn't you give this to me

589
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,070
when we entered Qianli's door?

590
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,070
Yes.

591
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,470
Ruan, I found it!

592
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,310
Put it on.

593
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,350
It's about time.

594
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,350
Let's go.

595
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,840
Don't you find this door weird?

596
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,430
Yes, it is weird.

597
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,830
But given that you're holding the key instead of using it to open the door,

598
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,790
I'd say you're weirder.

599
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,910
There is quite a lot of newcomers entering this door.

600
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,830
It seems like someone's bringing in newbies on purpose.

601
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,830
That's right.

602
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,760
You're indeed very observant.

603
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,560
With more people there,

604
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,590
we can rule out more conditions that could cause death.

605
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,550
Won't that just harm people's lives?

606
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,230
In order to survive, some people

607
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,470
wouldn't loath doing anything.

608
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,230
Are those newbies willing to become pawns?

609
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,550
Why aren't they?

610
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,770
Those guys are eager to succeed in the shortest time possible.

611
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,890
I've just found out

612
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,890
that a new organization is expanding recently.

613
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,590
They've ushered newcomers

614
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,850
into the door challenges for many times.

615
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,480
In the last one we took, You,

616
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,030
Tang Yaoyao, even Xiong Qi and Ke,

617
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,890
might be sided with those people.

618
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,310
They're sided?

619
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,150
Will they target us?

620
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,030
They'll possibly target all the door-passing organizations.

621
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,030
I'll find a chance

622
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,890
to talk to Li Dongyuan about this.

623
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,430
Are there many organizations

624
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,760
like Obsidian outside?

625
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,000
Of course there are.

626
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,010
On the forum I've shown you,

627
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,510
there is a ranking list of door-passing organizations.

628
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,440
So far, we, the Obsidian, have taken the first place.

629
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,910
Li Dongyuan's White Deer organization is known

630
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,580
for adopting tough and rough approaches to pass the challenges.

631
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,150
They tend to wind up jeopardizing both themselves and their enemies.

632
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,630
There is also a game organization called White Bear.

633
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,190
Their members like fighting alone.

634
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,860
Each of them are highly competent.

635
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,830
The organization that has just emerged recently

636
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,630
is said to be very rich,

637
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,660
but they'd use devious means to solve the challenges,

638
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,150
which is despised by many door-passing shepherds.

639
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,030
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,030
It's despicable.

641
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,480
But, gentlemen,

642
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,830
can we enter this door

643
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,760
before we talk about other things?

644
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Is Ruan Baijie still here today?

645
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,720
Is anyone in there?

646
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Who is it?

647
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,830
Is Ruan Baijie here today?

648
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,230
I'm coming!

649
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,950
Why is he always eating our food without paying a dime?

650
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,950
Hey.

651
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,390
I'm hungry.

652
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,630
As a 28-year-old grown man,

653
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,350
can't you stop acting coy and cheeky?

654
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,950
Doesn't it sicken yourself?

655
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,790
Who is 28?

656
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,310
I'm not 28 yet.

657
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,400
Are you already 28?

658
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,350
S-So what if I'm 28?

659
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,730
A man is still in his prime even if he's 40!

660
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,389
Dongyuan, don't hate Jiushi for that.

661
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,070
Though you don't have an advantage in age,

662
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,600
you do take the lead in looking older than him.

663
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,590
Are you just unable to say anything nice?

664
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,190
Baijie adores composed men.

665
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,400
When will Baijie come back?

666
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,230
She has something to deal with at home.

667
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,960
Can you ask her to call me again?

668
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,389
Again?

669
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,630
Has she called you once?

670
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,630
Yes.

671
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,480
She lashed out at me.

672
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,550
But that sounded like music.

673
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,670
The more she yells at me, the happier I feel.

674
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,429
Why are you still chattering?

675
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,630
Are you not hungry anymore?

676
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,270
If so, I'd like to show you out.

677
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,310
Come on. Let's go.

678
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,550
Stop eating. Stop it.

679
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,190
You're so disgusting.

680
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,230
I wish your appearance is as good

681
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,230
as your cooking.

682
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,670
Sweet.

683
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,550
So sweet!

684
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,790
If it weren't for that photo,

685
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,190
who could believe Baijie is Ruan?

686
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,310
Li Dongyuan has even said,

687
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,230
if Ruan Baijie agrees to work with him,

688
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,830
he'll offer plenty of clues

689
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,320
that Baijie could choose from.

690
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,120
What an attractive tyrant!

691
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,590
It's no wonder Li Dongyuan is still single.

692
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,850
Aren't you single too?

693
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,670
Come here.

694
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,710
Come here.

695
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,670
Hey, enjoy your meals!

696
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,870
Let's go.

697
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,390
I'm done too.

698
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,630
Enjoy.

699
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Is it funny?

700
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,070
Oh,

701
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,250
Li Dongyuan is different from you.

702
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,870
He's unable to get a girlfriend,

703
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,390
while you just don't want to get one.

704
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,700
You choose not to date anyone, whereas he doesn't get to choose.

705
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,030
Then are you single because you choose so?

706
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,070
Can't think of an answer?

707
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I...

708
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm usually busy working.

709
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,990
How do I have time to find a girlfriend?

710
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,390
You're in your twenties,

711
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,410
but you haven't had a girlfriend.

712
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,720
That's tragic when you think about it.

713
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,910
But don't worry.

714
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,360
If you really can't find a girlfriend,

715
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,710
you can always find a substitution.

716
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,030
Substitution?

717
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,270
Wel...

718
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,270
Maybe a cat?

719
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,590
And to think why you're single!

720
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,590
Hey.

721
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,760
Can't I be with a cat?

722
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,450
Playing games is a good choice, isn't it?

723
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,950
Hey! Chestnut!

724
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,950
Chestnut!

725
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,950
Oh!

726
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,950
Chestnut?

727
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Losers!

728
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,990
You're a bunch of losers!

729
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,590
The Obsidian organization only has several players.

730
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,850
They're just amateurs

731
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,950
who can't pose a threat to us.

732
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,490
You've lost so many times.

733
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,090
What gives you the right to judge others?

734
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,190
I've met them two in a door challenge,

735
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,550
and made their acquaintance.

736
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,550
Why not let me

737
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,720
try to persuade that guy to join us?

738
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,190
Turning a foe

739
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,630
into a friend

740
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,670
is also a way to eliminate a rival.

741
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,590
Come on. Go.

742
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,670
Raise your paw.

743
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,830
Bang!

744
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,890
Come on. High five!

745
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
The two of you...

746
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,390
Hey. Don't go away.

747
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,720
You do get along so well.

748
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,760
Don't run away. What are you afraid of?

749
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,950
Ruan.

750
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,870
Ruan.

751
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,030
Li Dongyuan has sent me a clue

752
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,760
about the next door challenge.

753
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,230
He gave you a fake key last time.

754
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,070
Aren't you worried that this time he'd give you fake stuff again?

755
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,830
He thinks this time my sister Ruan Baijie

756
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,430
will enter the door with him,

757
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,390
so now he's trying to impress her.

758
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,990
If he knows what Ruan Baijie really looks like,

759
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,670
I guess he'll even break the door from the inside.

760
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,870
It all depends on his own intelligence.

761
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,590
What is the clue?

762
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,950
One word.

763
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,190
"Sako."

764
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,190
It's a Black Tortoise door about mental strength.

765
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,270
"Sako," and mental strength.

766
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,670
Will it be like the door challenge about coffins,

767
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,870
where we made friends with the Door Ghost?

768
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,590
No one would make friends with Door Ghosts

769
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,790
like you did.

770
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,990
What else? Just one word?

771
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,360
What about the other information?

772
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,310
It's true that Li Dongyuan has sent me

773
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,630
some detailed information,

774
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,830
but I don't trust him.

775
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,150
So,

776
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,430
I think we should find the clues ourselves.

777
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,430
I see!

778
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,550
Ay! I got it!

779
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,750
I'll look for information on the forum.

780
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,220
My laptop...
