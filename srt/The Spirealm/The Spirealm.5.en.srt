00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,380
(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,950
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
You're here.

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,270
Come in.

5
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,750
Don't drop the egg.

6
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,230
Zhi Dong, hang in there.

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,790
Okay?

8
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,550
Let me introduce.

9
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,729
These are my three daughters.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,860
I'm so glad

11
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,390
you came to their birthday party.

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,590
Please wait a moment.

13
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,310
I'll get you the key.

14
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,880
The time inside the door

15
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,030
is set in 1985.

16
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,910
All the rooms outside are available.

17
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,550
Thank you.

18
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,550
You're welcome.

19
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,190
Let's go and get them in.

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Okay.

21
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,830
One egg for each.

22
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,590
Please keep it.

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,190
Why are you giving us eggs, Old Bro?

24
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,990
I'm only 40.

25
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,829
It's inappropriate for you to call me that.

26
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,110
Are we really going to take it?

27
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,590
Eggs are fragile.

28
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,710
Please keep it safe.

29
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,590
Thank you again

30
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,230
for coming to my daughters' birthday party.

31
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,829
It will be held in three days.

32
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,110
I hope you'll be happy

33
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,830
at the party.

34
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,630
I'll prepare the food.

35
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,510
Please enjoy your stay here.

36
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,350
It is said that a daughter looks like a father.

37
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,950
They don't look alike at all.

38
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,230
He and his daughters

39
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,709
seem distant.

40
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,310
Great.

41
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,070
Finally, we have a group of people to play

42
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,510
the Egg Game with.

43
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,990
The Egg Game?

44
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,560
What's the rule?

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,670
To protect the eggs from breaking.

46
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,950
Nothing else.

47
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,310
Girls, are you triplets?

48
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,270
What are your names?

49
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,400
Who's the youngest?

50
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,909
Even if we tell you,

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,840
you won't be able to tell the differences among us.

52
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,190
You should be polite

53
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,510
to your guests.

54
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,950
Give it a try

55
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,290
to see if we can tell the differences.

56
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,190
I'm the eldest, Tu.

57
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,610
This is my sister, Shi.

58
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,560
This is my youngest sister, Yi.

59
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,860
Be good.

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,630
Okay, we got it. Go play.

61
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,150
Their names are not serious at all.

62
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,930
Now there are conditions.

63
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,310
In three days,

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,670
we're going to attend the birthday party of the triplets.

65
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,590
Before that,

66
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,790
we need to find the door and the key.

67
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,070
If not,

68
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,190
I think we'll die three days later.

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
(Three days)

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,480
(Before the Birthday Party)

71
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,600
I feel depressed in this room.

72
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,910
It looks like a coffin.

73
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,550
Yes, it looks like the coffin I made recently.

74
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,210
Is it the one filling the well?

75
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
No.

76
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,510
It's the one I made

77
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,590
for my friend's cat.

78
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,990
It's good to have a place to stay.

79
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,830
Do you really think you're here to stay at a hotel?

80
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,350
Come on. Let's decide how to share these rooms.

81
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,070
Four keys. Four rooms.

82
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,010
Zhu Meng, I'll live in the same room with you.

83
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,750
It's improper for men and women to stay in the same room.

84
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,350
I'll share one room with him.

85
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,730
You two share another one.

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,590
Okay.

87
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,590
Here.

88
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,310
Well,

89
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,630
I'll share a room with him.

90
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,110
What if something happens

91
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,430
if I live alone?

92
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,110
In the world inside the doors,

93
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,710
one will die sooner or later.

94
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,550
It doesn't matter who you live with.

95
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,350
It's late. Go to bed early.

96
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,909
Let's go.

97
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,750
Why don't you share a room with your client?

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
It's improper.

99
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,360
It's meaningless to care too much when you are dying.

100
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,970
Whoever reveals their team first

101
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,790
will become the target.

102
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,950
Your user experience is so poor.

103
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,010
Do you want to switch with her?

104
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,909
Isn't it obvious for Yan to see

105
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,440
that we are on the same side?

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,550
Stop talking about others.

107
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,550
Tell me

108
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,830
the story of Fitcher's Bird.

109
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,870
It's from "Grimm's Fairy Tales."

110
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,030
There was

111
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,070
a wizard

112
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,230
pretending to be a beggar.

113
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,810
He captured young girls to be his brides.

114
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,800
One day,

115
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,590
he captured the eldest daughter of a family

116
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,350
and gave her a key and an egg.

117
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,240
He told her not to go into a certain room.

118
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,870
But the girl couldn't help being curious.

119
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,310
She broke the egg when entering the room

120
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,150
and was killed by the wizard.

121
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,950
Then he kidnapped the second daughter of that family

122
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,990
and told the girl the same thing.

123
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,300
In the end, she couldn't help being curious

124
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,390
and was killed by the wizard.

125
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,750
Then he kidnapped the youngest daughter of that family.

126
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,860
She was so smart

127
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,550
that she killed the wizard with her wisdom.

128
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,790
So the wizard died.

129
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,669
You did a lot of research on that.

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,350
Don't you have more details?

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,480
Like what you know about the last door?

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,190
You are to blame.

133
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,840
You ruined the first door by accident.

134
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,150
Now it's a new shuffle.

135
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,480
Many clues don't match.

136
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,710
Those door-passing organizations are very busy dealing with it.

137
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,390
Are there chain reactions?

138
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,710
Yes.

139
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,990
In that case,

140
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,210
the triplets holding the eggs

141
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,610
should be the three sisters in the story.

142
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,190
Literally speaking,

143
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,640
we should protect our balls first.

144
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,510
Can you be more serious?

145
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,430
The wizard in the story

146
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,690
should be the father of the triplets.

147
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,230
Could it be

148
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,870
that simple?

149
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,950
Shall we look for more clues?

150
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,710
Okay.

151
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,350
Who is it?

152
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,350
Me.

153
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,670
Your client.

154
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,190
Are you sure that we don't need to enter the building

155
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,710
before going downstairs?

156
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,990
No one is on these floors.

157
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,630
Lingling, how did you know that?

158
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,870
The most important thing is missing.

159
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,790
What?

160
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,790
Trash.

161
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,230
The trash cans on every floor

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,430
are clean.

163
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,310
Is it true that there's only one household, and it's on the 14th floor?

164
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,240
No wonder the elevator can only reach the 14th floor.

165
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
See?

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,390
The little boy held an egg in his mouth.

167
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,780
You also saw him?

168
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,810
It's the seventh floor again.

169
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,670
The magnetic field here is messy.

170
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,230
It seems there's something dirty.

171
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,710
Don't scare me.

172
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,710
Let's go inside.

173
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,590
My skin is so dry

174
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,550
that it seems to be wrinkled.

175
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,830
Can you focus on finding clues?

176
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,710
Don't you feel it?

177
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,660
I feel like there's cellulite

178
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,070
on my face.

179
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,430
Then you become ugly.

180
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,710
Him again?

181
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,030
This floor is a bit strange.

182
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,930
Let's go out first.

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,710
Let's not act rashly on the first night.

184
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,310
Let's go down and have a look.

185
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,780
There's trash here.

186
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,510
There's someone on this floor.

187
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,110
You can't assume it as "someone."

188
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,950
Why grab my arm?

189
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,720
Don't be afraid. We're here.

190
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,250
Lingling, you are so nice.

191
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,070
Zhu Meng, you are merciless.

192
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,030
You scared me a lot.

193
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,110
After we went down from the seventh floor,

194
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,710
this floor seemed shabbier.

195
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,910
It's true.

196
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,950
What's on the wall?

197
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,030
It seems to be corroded.

198
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,110
I heard a sound.

199
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,590
About 55 kilograms.

200
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,620
You can even tell that?

201
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Let me try.

202
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,310
No one is here.

203
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,150
Did you hear it wrong?

204
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,150
The lock is rusty. It's easy to open.

205
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,830
I need a hairpin.

206
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,710
You know how to unlock a door?

207
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,990
I learned it to make a living.

208
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,030
You can really do that.

209
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,030
Who are you?

210
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,110
Hello.

211
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,790
We're new neighbors.

212
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,650
We have some questions to ask.

213
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,970
You must be having a hard time.

214
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
Me?

215
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,990
Is that possible?

216
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,390
I'll give you a chance

217
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,040
to live for yourself again.

218
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,050
What are you trying to say?

219
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,390
Let me introduce myself.

220
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,790
I am a scientist

221
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,550
and the CTO of the Hyperspace Research Association.

222
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,470
My achievements include, but are not limited to,

223
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,790
the three-dimensional distortion of time and space,

224
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,870
practical applications of general relativity,

225
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,710
the specific algorithm of gravitational waves,

226
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,790
and the transmission and exchange of quantum entanglement.

227
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,680
Let me tell you a secret.

228
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,030
I have a time machine.

229
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,510
Wait.

230
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,350
I just said

231
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
we had some questions

232
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,110
to ask.

233
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,190
Have a look at the time machine.

234
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,390
Sir,

235
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,570
why is no one living in this building?

236
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,870
This is a complicated problem.

237
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,590
Actually, this building is on a singular point

238
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,830
of the collapse of a static wormhole.

239
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,440
How come the residents on the 14th floor are fine?

240
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,710
I don't know. I have no idea. That's all.

241
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,990
He closed the door before we finished.

242
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,390
Why is he so rude?

243
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,270
Let's go downstairs and have a look.

244
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,270
Let's go.

245
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,510
There's noise here. Someone's inside.

246
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,230
Hello, Granny. I'm here to...

247
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,590
I've eaten.

248
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,380
No, I mean,

249
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,790
where are your neighbors...

250
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,710
I'm so full today.

251
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,750
I was thinking...

252
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,350
I had braised pork.

253
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,860
It seems that she's hearing-impaired.

254
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,990
Let's go.

255
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Granny.

256
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,710
We'd like to invite you to the 14th floor.

257
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,030
Will I have pork again tomorrow?

258
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,910
Granny.

259
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,350
Since you've been found,

260
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,790
stop pretending.

261
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,600
I can't tell you.

262
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,870
I can't.

263
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,150
Then tell me something you are allowed to say.

264
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,750
If you don't go out

265
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,790
before 12:35 p.m.,

266
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,510
the door will open.

267
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,070
Dense fog will devour everything here.

268
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,870
So accurate?

269
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,790
On which day?

270
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,240
Maybe every day.

271
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,750
I can say no more.

272
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,350
No, I can't.

273
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,390
Looks like

274
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,050
the building was eroded by the dense fog.

275
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,550
The residents

276
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,910
left because of dense fog.

277
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,070
I think

278
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,510
Granny must be hiding something.

279
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,310
NPCs won't tell us everything

280
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,710
all at once.

281
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,150
Be patient, and keep looking for clues.

282
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,030
Could it be at 12:35

283
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,720
on the triplets' birthday?

284
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,110
Could it be that easy?

285
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,290
After all, so many people died inside this door.

286
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,990
Don't think too much.

287
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,960
Where are you going?

288
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,110
To take a shower.

289
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,390
Shall we go together?

290
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,670
Let's go.

291
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,630
Do you know who I am?

292
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,109
No.

293
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,910
Do you really not know who I am?

294
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,710
We need to take a shower.

295
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,710
Get out of the way.

296
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,780
Do you know who I am?

297
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Don't ask me.

298
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,070
You scared me.

299
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,110
Did you hear that?

300
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,000
- What? - No.

301
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,390
Someone is singing.

302
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,790
A little girl is singing.

303
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,670
Maybe I am wrong.

304
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,230
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,630
Why are you making a fuss?

306
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,010
What are you doing?

307
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,030
Stop it.

308
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,150
I really heard it.

309
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm leaving.

310
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,630
Don't go.

311
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,350
Do you still want to take a shower?

312
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,150
I want to.

313
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,270
But can you stay outside?

314
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,390
Okay.

315
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,090
I'll wait for you outside.

316
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,150
You're a good man.

317
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,470
I'll be back soon.

318
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,510
Is it Yu Lingling?

319
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,790
Where can't I find her?

320
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,950
Yu Lingling.

321
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,630
How dare you break my egg!

322
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,350
No.

323
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,350
Wasn't that you?

324
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,470
No. I don't know.

325
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,630
I asked you to wait for me outside.

326
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,270
You always act like a good person.

327
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,750
It turns out you're the worst.

328
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,350
I'll beat you to death today.

329
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,750
Before you decide to hit someone,

330
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,470
evaluate yourself first.

331
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,830
I told you not to be a good man.

332
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,310
Come back with me.

333
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,270
Bah!

334
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,710
Do you know who I am?

335
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,550
Don't you know who I am?

336
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,390
Of course, I know.

337
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,350
You're the youngest daughter, Yi.

338
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,830
You're the second daughter, Shi.

339
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,630
You're the eldest daughter, Tu.

340
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,230
So, what's the reward for my guess?

341
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,150
You can play with us for a while.

342
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,990
I'm sorry about that.

343
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,960
It's late. We need to rest.

344
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,370
You should go home too.

345
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,830
This is not our home.

346
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,030
We want to go home too.

347
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,590
What do you mean?

348
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,360
Why are you wandering here?

349
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,560
Go back to your room.

350
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,480
I recognized the triplets.

351
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,690
You don't seem curious at all.

352
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Beg me,

353
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,270
and I'll tell you how I did that.

354
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,910
I saw it.

355
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,590
You saw it?

356
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm the eldest sister, Tu.

357
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,870
This is my second sister, Shi.

358
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,600
This is my youngest sister, Yi.

359
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,730
Be good.

360
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,390
Okay, we got it. Go play.

361
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,950
You got glitter in your hand.

362
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,230
The eldest sister is the one with glitter in her hair.

363
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,990
The second sister is the one with glitter on her shoulder.

364
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,920
The youngest sister doesn't have any glitter on her.

365
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,910
I missed a chance for you to beg me.

366
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,900
Should we tell others?

367
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,910
Before we know their sides,

368
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,210
we must treat them as enemies.

369
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,590
I'll go out

370
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,480
and tell Xu Xiaocheng about this.

371
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,830
It occurred to me

372
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,590
that the triplets said this was not their home.

373
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,530
Maybe they were kidnapped by the wizard,

374
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,510
like in the story of Fitcher's Bird.

375
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,790
If that's the case,

376
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,070
that man must be the wizard.

377
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
Wizard.

378
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,030
The one with glitter in her hair is the eldest.

379
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,790
The youngest doesn't have glitter on her.

380
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,510
Where does the second sister have glitter,

381
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,000
or does she have no glitter?

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,310
Do you three know each other?

383
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,310
Yes.

384
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,910
No.

385
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,670
What did you find?

386
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,920
I envy you.

387
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,010
You have someone to take care of you here.

388
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,870
Unlike me,

389
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm alone outside the door.

390
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,750
And I'm alone inside.

391
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,050
No one cares, even if I die.

392
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,070
D-Don't say that.

393
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,000
The world inside the door is so dangerous.

394
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,650
We have to stick together.

395
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,990
We found nothing.

396
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,590
People only live

397
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,950
on the 14th floor of this building.

398
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,630
We've done all this

399
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,870
for nothing.

400
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,110
Don't worry.

401
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,310
We'll let you know

402
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,670
if we find something.

403
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,250
If you find something,

404
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,750
please tell us.

405
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,830
Have you found anything?

406
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,990
It's the first day.

407
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,830
I want to wait

408
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,590
to see what the taboo condition is

409
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,150
for the one who dies first.

410
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,640
Someone will die tonight?

411
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,550
Who is it?

412
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,830
Guess.

413
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,870
These little mice want to move the eggs.

414
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,110
What if the eggs are too big?

415
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,550
A mouse is lying on the ground.

416
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,390
Who?

417
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,030
Holding the big egg tightly.

418
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,230
Who is singing?

419
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,480
A mouse is pulling its tail.

420
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,830
Pulling it back home.

421
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,150
Anyone? Open the door!

422
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,230
Let me out!

423
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,750
Help!

424
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,180
What if the eggs are too big?

425
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,510
A mouse is running on the ground.

426
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,990
Holding the big egg tightly.

427
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,350
A mouse is pulling its tail.

428
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,830
Pulling it back home.

429
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,510
A mouse is pulling its tail.

430
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,590
Pulling it back home.

431
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,040
(Two days)

432
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,080
(Before the Birthday Party)

433
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,710
I just made it.

434
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,230
Try it.

435
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,150
What?

436
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,230
Does it look bad?

437
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,590
I'm a vegetarian.

438
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,750
I'm not hungry.

439
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,270
I-I'm on a diet.

440
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,990
Could...

441
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,990
Could this be Zeng...

442
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,710
Don't you think

443
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,070
they have a special relationship?

444
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,730
What does it have to do with me?

445
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,670
Zeng Ruguo was alone and died.

446
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,830
Do you think

447
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,830
you can fight alone and survive?

448
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,150
What do you mean?

449
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,580
Let's work together to find clues.

450
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Zhu Meng

451
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,120
is obviously experienced.

452
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,390
Why don't I come to him
if I want to form an alliance?

453
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,420
Do they want to ally with you?

454
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,310
We don't help others here

455
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,990
only when you're useful.

456
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,310
What do you think

457
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,270
you can give them?

458
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,830
What can you give me?

459
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,070
Let me tell you.

460
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Bro,

461
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,160
let's talk a little bit.

462
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,110
You go back first.

463
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,290
What's the matter?

464
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,840
I have a clue to this door,

465
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,400
the Fitcher's Bird.

466
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,430
What are you trying to say?

467
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,150
Are the three sisters in fairy tales

468
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,150
triplets?

469
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,590
Maybe, from the literal meaning.

470
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,370
What do you think the taboo condition is?

471
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,470
Actually,

472
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,030
I don't know yet.

473
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,510
Zeng Ruguo didn't

474
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,310
tell the triplets apart yesterday.

475
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,310
Me too.

476
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,670
Maybe I can trust you

477
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,710
after you do it in front of me.

478
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,670
Is the middle-aged man

479
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,310
the wizard who kidnapped the triplets?

480
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,510
Maybe.

481
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,230
What taboo condition

482
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,190
did Zeng Ruguo trigger?

483
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,760
In the story of Fitcher's Bird,

484
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,870
the girl will get killed by the wizard

485
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,670
if the egg is stained with blood.

486
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,830
We

487
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,640
may be the eggs in the story.

488
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,010
Zeng Ruguo had blood on him when he entered here.

489
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,430
But

490
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,510
he must have washed it off

491
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,040
when he was taking a shower.

492
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,350
I suddenly remembered that we had met the triplets

493
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,440
before we entered the bathroom.

494
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,630
She asked if we could tell them apart.

495
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,090
Zeng Ruguo didn't answer.

496
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,960
I also thought of it.

497
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,230
Zhang Xinghuo asked me the same thing today.

498
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,910
He asked me if the father of the triplets

499
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,190
was the wizard.

500
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,950
Oh no.

501
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,670
You three grow so fast.

502
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,220
Come on.

503
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,830
Let me measure you again.

504
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,350
I'll make new clothes

505
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,710
for each of you.

506
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,630
We don't need new clothes.

507
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,030
Let us go.

508
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,590
No!

509
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,990
It's dangerous outside.

510
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,510
This is the safest place.

511
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,790
Can I help you?

512
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,990
I do

513
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,670
need your help.

514
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,260
Is there anything I can help with?

515
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,110
Go back to your room.

516
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,270
Lock the door.

517
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,890
The wizard is dead.

518
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,450
The Door Ghost is dead.

519
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,070
Behind you.

520
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,110
Run!

521
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,550
Come with me.

522
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Zhu.

523
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,430
Why did he die?

524
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,430
He tried to kill the Door Ghost.

525
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,790
He did?

526
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,910
That's what happens to the one who wants to kill the Door Ghost.

527
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,910
That man

528
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,870
is indeed the wizard.

529
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,630
But he didn't fight back

530
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,510
when Zhang Xinghuo hit him.

531
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,510
Did he want to show us

532
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,750
that he's immortal?

533
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,350
Maybe Zhang Xinghuo

534
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,350
didn't trigger the taboo condition at that time,

535
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,680
but it was triggered during the fighting.

536
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,070
So,

537
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,150
not being able to tell the triplets apart

538
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,750
is not a taboo condition.

539
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,070
She keeps asking us that question.

540
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,390
What's the point?

541
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,430
I know.

542
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,630
The egg is broken.

543
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,840
Maybe this is the taboo condition.

544
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Yes.

545
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,389
The world of doors

546
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,389
is built with countless lives.

547
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,630
We have to be careful.

548
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,230
We can't drop the eggs.

549
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,830
What were the people

550
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,429
who created these 12 doors thinking?

551
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,429
Insane.

552
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,630
Unethical.

553
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,620
Needy.

554
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,620
Who knows?

555
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,510
Can we get out, Zhu?

556
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,670
Let's figure out the taboo condition first

557
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,670
to save our lives.

558
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,710
And then find the way out and the key.

559
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,770
I want to go to the 7th floor again.

560
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,870
There?

561
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,270
Isn't it haunted?

562
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,150
The stranger it is,

563
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,030
the more likely there are clues.

564
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,030
Go back first.

565
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,989
Don't let Tian Yan know too much.

566
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,470
Do you think Tian Yan

567
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,800
is not reliable?

568
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,430
It has nothing to do with me.

569
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,230
She's not my client.

570
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,990
720.

571
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,750
The magnetic field is chaotic here.

572
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,550
I saw that little boy again with an egg in his mouth.

573
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,550
You saw it too.

574
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,130
It seems that this is related to this boy.

575
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,630
But who is that boy?

576
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,310
This place

577
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,990
has been abandoned for decades.

578
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,750
It's quite shabby.

579
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,630
But it's strange.

580
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,910
There seems to be no trace of corrosion.

581
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,270
Yes.

582
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,470
Not back yet.

583
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,790
Do you know who I am?

584
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,030
No, no.

585
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,190
What did Zhu tell me?

586
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,990
Whose head has glitter?

587
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,580
Whose shoulder has glitter?

588
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,990
Don't you know who I am?

589
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,790
Anyone? Open the door!

590
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,950
It's no use.

591
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,750
This is the 7th floor.

592
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,150
There are too many floors.

593
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,150
No one can hear us.

594
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,990
What should we do?

595
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,550
Have a seat.

596
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,670
You are so calm.

597
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,030
Just wait.

598
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,880
Xu Xiaocheng knows we're here.

599
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,270
If we don't go back,

600
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,450
she will come to us.

601
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,650
I hope she's smart enough.

602
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,150
Okay.

603
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,990
Y-You...

604
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,270
Did someone hurt her head?

605
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,670
Did you take care of it?

606
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,310
Don't leave any sequelae.

607
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,230
It's me, Yi. I'm fine now.

608
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,150
You're Yi.

609
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,670
That's good.

610
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,710
Do you know who I am?

611
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
Of course...

612
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,470
I know.

613
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,030
One side of Yi

614
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,750
is Shi.

615
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:28,630
The other side is Tu.

616
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,750
Bingo. Here.

617
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,350
Scared me to death.

618
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,030
Why did they give me this?

619
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,110
They are not here.

620
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,130
Do they want me to go by myself?

621
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,230
Someone is here.
