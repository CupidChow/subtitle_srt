(THE SPIREALM)

2
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,880
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Hurry!

4
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,150
Hurry!

5
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,030
Take care of my child.

6
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,070
Take him away from here.

7
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,270
Take care of him for me

8
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,880
and let him live a good life.

9
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,640
Don't worry.

10
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,110
I will take him out

11
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,950
and let him live a happy and healthy life.

12
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Thank you.

13
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,150
Leave

14
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,950
before it's too late.

15
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,270
The poisonous gas is spreading.

16
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,470
Hurry up!

17
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
Let's go.

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,210
Thank you for taking care of my child.

19
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,150
Damn.

20
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,470
Oh no.

21
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,030
I have something to do tonight. I have to go.

22
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,230
I put the doll here.

23
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,950
Chestnut.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,750
Are you finally willing to let me hug you, Chestnut?

25
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,210
You finally let me hug you.

26
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,150
Are you good?

27
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,630
Okay.

28
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,630
What's wrong?

29
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
What's wrong?

30
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,630
Ling Jiushi.

31
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,510
What's wrong?

32
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
Chestnut.

33
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,350
Thanks.

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,750
Keep the doll.

35
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,110
The doll?

36
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,230
It might be

37
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,820
a useful tool later.

38
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,150
Shall I keep it at home?

39
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,710
There are a few safe boxes in the study.

40
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,720
Put it in the safe.

41
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,240
Remember to bring it when you pass the door next time.

42
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,870
What's the use of it?

43
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,990
I don't know.

44
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,320
You need to figure it out yourself.

45
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,920
It's the same as that diary.

46
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,110
Actually,

47
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,950
I've been thinking about asking you

48
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,270
whether anyone

49
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,890
has ever passed the twelfth door.

50
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,350
You're so awesome,

51
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,310
but you've only passed the tenth door.

52
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,990
Have you seen anyone

53
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,250
from the twelfth door?

54
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,110
No.

55
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,510
In fact, no one does.

56
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,110
Maybe we should think in such a way

57
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,240
that someone passed

58
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,190
but we didn't see him.

59
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,030
Don't doubt it.

60
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,960
This is the only way.

61
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,510
Is there any evidence

62
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,870
to prove this?

63
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,120
If it were someone else,

64
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,870
I might say yes.

65
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,750
But I don't want to lie

66
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,710
to you.

67
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,909
Does anyone else know it?

68
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,750
Some do,

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,470
while some don't.

70
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,750
But it doesn't matter

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,430
if they know it.

72
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,950
We have to pass this door.

73
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,640
Whether you are willing or not,

74
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,190
you have no choice.

75
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,430
You're strong.

76
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,990
That's good.

77
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,870
But not everyone can accept the reality

78
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,150
as quickly as you did.

79
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,910
Therefore,

80
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,010
everyone must have a goal.

81
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,390
A goal?

82
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,350
I've found my goal.

83
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,150
I hope one day

84
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,190
you can find your own.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,270
It's easier said than done.

86
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,370
You think too highly of me.

87
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,070
Am I wrong?

88
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,430
No.

89
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,710
Absolutely not.

90
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,550
Get some rest.

91
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
You too.

92
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,150
Have you decided?

93
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,030
It's him.

94
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,550
It is up to you

95
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,430
to decide.

96
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,290
But judging from his performance of passing doors,

97
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,410
he's not outstanding.

98
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,910
It's normal to have ups and downs.

99
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,370
Performance fluctuates.

100
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,170
You've set a stand in advance.

101
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,850
It's useless to say anything.

102
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,880
Do you really think so highly of Yi Manman?

103
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,159
I do not think highly of anyone.

104
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,150
I just think you should tell them

105
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,590
from the beginning

106
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,710
to compete fairly

107
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,190
and do their best.

108
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,510
It's the catfish effect.

109
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,909
He is the one I choose.

110
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,870
I'm satisfied with him. That's enough.

111
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,170
How is Yi Manman recently?

112
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,510
He's indeed emotional.

113
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,990
He's not used to it.

114
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,950
Take care of him.

115
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,110
Don't let anything go wrong.

116
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,470
Don't worry.

117
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,790
You know

118
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,940
the person I want to recommend the most is me.

119
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,310
Thank you for your kindness.

120
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,350
Thank you.

121
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,110
Manman.

122
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,670
Manman.

123
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,720
What are you doing?

124
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,910
It's raw.

125
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,910
Please let me explain.

126
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,470
I don't want to do this.

127
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,230
But I can't help it.

128
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,910
Step back.

129
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,790
Step back.

130
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,430
I can't help it.

131
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Manman.

132
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,250
If you are feeling bad,

133
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,710
I can take you to the doctor.

134
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,280
Are you really okay?

135
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,510
I'm fine.

136
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,030
What's wrong?

137
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Chen Fei.

138
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,950
Manman.

139
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,760
Did you just come out from the door?

140
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,550
Are you hungry?

141
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,210
Let me cook something for you.

142
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,910
What happened to him?

143
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,990
It's scary.

144
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,730
He's affected by the world inside the doors.

145
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,830
Humans are weak-minded.

146
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,480
Once strongly stimulated,

147
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,750
our mind will easily be in a mess.

148
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,430
Not everyone can accept it

149
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,790
as calmly as you.

150
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,510
The worst situation inside the doors

151
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,770
are that everyone dies

152
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,280
before the door and the key appear.

153
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,800
If that happens, one will be trapped in the door alone

154
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,770
without knowing how long it may last.

155
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,790
Manman.

156
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,430
Are you okay?

157
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
What should we do?

158
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,550
I don't know.

159
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,990
You don't know?

160
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,710
What do you mean?

161
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,080
I mean it literally.

162
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,710
I don't know if he can recover

163
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,150
and if he can

164
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,720
distinguish the real world from the world inside the doors.

165
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,900
What if he can't?

166
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,150
If he can't,

167
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,910
he will be doomed.

168
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,400
One can't stay in this villa any longer

169
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,270
if he can't distinguish that.

170
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,270
Manman.

171
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,710
Go get the knife and fork.

172
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,950
Eat slowly.

173
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,590
Eat slowly. Slow down.

174
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,750
Tell me

175
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,950
what happened

176
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,170
in the world inside the doors?

177
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,150
Nothing.

178
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,710
It's just a scary world.

179
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,320
There's nothing to eat.

180
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,410
I'm always hungry.

181
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,670
I'll go back first.

182
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,630
Thank you.

183
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
Chen Fei.

184
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,510
I think he's indeed mentally

185
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,950
unstable.

186
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
I'll take him

187
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,990
to have a check-up later.

188
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,590
What's wrong?

189
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,400
You look like you're not awake.

190
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,770
I stayed up late. I didn't sleep well.

191
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,910
Take care.

192
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,190
You'll have a receding hairline if you stay up late.

193
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,050
It's already bald because of you.

194
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,110
Good morning.

195
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,910
Sorry

196
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,480
for scaring you last night.

197
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,230
I just came out from the door.

198
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,590
I didn't adjust myself.

199
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,590
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
It's okay.

201
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,390
Have you adjusted yourself?

202
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,110
Yes.

203
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,150
I really want to have hotpot now.

204
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:19,950
Morning, Ruan.

205
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,950
Morning.

206
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,870
Ruan.

207
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,040
I need to talk to you.

208
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,950
Okay.

209
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,230
Let's go.

210
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
Here.

211
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
Who is it?

212
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,870
Manman, what's up?

213
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,910
I want to talk to you,

214
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,550
is that okay?

215
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,710
Sure.

216
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,530
Wait for me to change clothes.

217
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,970
What do you want to say?

218
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,520
Just five minutes. It'll be quick.

219
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,790
Okay.

220
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,790
Just say it.

221
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,990
I'm busy.

222
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Hurry up.

223
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,750
Just one bite.

224
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,910
You look so delicious.

226
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,950
I can't help it.

227
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,630
Even if I will expose myself,

228
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,870
I still don't want to stop.

229
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,430
What are you doing, Ruan Lanzhu?

230
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,410
You wouldn't have been infected too, would you?

231
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,610
For disinfection.

232
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,030
Thank you.

233
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,070
Chen,

234
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,640
where are the others?

235
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,850
They went to see Yi Manman off.

236
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,910
See Yi Manman off?

237
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,510
It's all my fault.

238
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,350
I shouldn't have left him alone.

239
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,830
I thought he could endure it,

240
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,400
but he had poor self-control.

241
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,040
Where did you send him?

242
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,230
To a place dedicated to managing people like them.

243
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,790
After being influenced by the door,

244
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,230
their behavior in reality may deviate,

245
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,960
and they need psychological counseling.

246
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,130
A mental hospital?

247
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,240
It's not the first time anyway.

248
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,710
As for whether the coaching can be successful or not,

249
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,190
it depends on himself.

250
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,470
Judging from his current state,

251
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,270
placing him anywhere would be very dangerous.

252
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,840
Is your injury serious?

253
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,500
Do you want me to help you check it?

254
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,310
It's okay. I've disinfected it. It's fine.

255
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,570
I didn't expect things to develop like this.

256
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,930
Take care of yourself.

257
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,310
I'll go see Manman.

258
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,510
Okay.

259
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,390
Lingling.

260
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,910
You're back.

261
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,550
How is Manman?

262
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,370
My brother is with him.

263
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,130
He'll come back when his condition stabilizes.

264
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,510
My brother has passed several doors with him.

265
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,440
Although my brother didn't say it,

266
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,990
I know he must be upset.

267
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,120
Are you feeling better?

268
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,260
Yes, I just took a shower.

269
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Thank you.

270
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,150
You're welcome.

271
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,400
Can Manman be cured?

272
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,210
It depends on himself.

273
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,910
Has there been such a situation before?

274
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,350
It's normal.

275
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,230
99

276
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,470
out of 100 people

277
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,870
will experience psychological problems,

278
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,420
and the remaining one is him.

279
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
What do you mean?

280
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,260
What do you mean I'm the remaining one?

281
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,990
He means you're very talented.

282
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,910
Of course.

283
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,820
My psychological quality is very strong.

284
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,340
Isn't your brother looking for you for something?

285
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Go now.

286
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,870
Oh!

287
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,430
Yes, I forgot something.

288
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,470
Ling Jiushi,

289
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,750
I have something to tell you.

290
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,550
What is it? Go ahead.

291
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,810
Why are you so serious?

292
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,230
Aren't you curious why I established Obsidian?

293
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,890
Aren't you curious why I established Obsidian?

294
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,570
Isn't it for passing the door?

295
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,200
I established Obsidian

296
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,550
not to pass the game,

297
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,440
but to purify it.

298
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,030
To purify the game?

299
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,350
Yes.

300
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,710
The game the Spi Realm comes from abroad.

301
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,470
It's a Chinese designer's idea.

302
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,820
You can tell

303
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,030
from the setting of Blue Dragon, White Tiger,

304
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,030
Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise.

305
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,150
I think he's great.

306
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,360
He can use Chinese traditional cultural core

307
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,470
to set the type of infinite game.

308
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,030
At the beginning,

309
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,580
this game is just a semi-finished product

310
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,790
of building virtual and real technology.

311
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,590
The code is called the Spi Realm.

312
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,830
As a game,

313
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,030
it's just a semi-finished product.

314
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,030
Only the world outlook is finished.

315
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,030
As for the violence, blood,

316
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,390
and distorted human nature you see,

317
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,050
That's the capital of America

318
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,390
by the capital of Country A

319
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,520
for more interests and traffic.

320
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,350
They act in the dark side,

321
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,560
and they don't care about the game players at all.

322
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,510
This is the cold side of capital.

323
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,110
When I came out of the last door,

324
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,910
I felt like this game

325
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,360
had something to do with me.

326
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,120
Maybe this is your destiny.

327
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,550
Then your purpose

328
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,270
is to purify the game?

329
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,270
Yes.

330
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,910
Let the game return to its original form

331
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,030
and end blood and violence.

332
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,470
No wonder you didn't ally with Xiong Qi.

333
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,770
Your goals are fundamentally opposite.

334
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,680
Why did you suddenly want to tell me today?

335
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,790
To purify this game,

336
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,910
it is clear that we will touch upon the interests of many people.

337
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,150
The more low-key we are, the safer we are,

338
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,680
otherwise, we will only be exposed to danger.

339
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,990
I'll keep it a secret

340
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,250
until I confirm my candidate.

341
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,270
I understand.

342
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,630
Is there anyone else besides me?

343
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,200
You and Yi Manman are both candidates.

344
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,390
Let's team up

345
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,470
and pass the 12th door together.

346
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,150
Then Chen Fei and Cheng Qianli...

347
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,400
No, not Qianli...

348
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,760
Cheng Yixie.

349
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,080
What about they two?

350
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,550
I've tried. They can't.

351
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,790
You have no other choice now.

352
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,790
My choice

353
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,830
has nothing to do with Yi Manman.

354
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,550
I've always been sure

355
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,400
you are the one I want to choose.

356
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,830
I just need some time to verify.

357
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,790
From the first door,

358
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
you felt like

359
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,160
I could be your partner?

360
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,030
Although we still don't know

361
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,630
the clue of the twelfth door,

362
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,790
one thing is for sure.

363
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,470
The 12th door

364
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,790
must be very dangerous.

365
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,270
So, my partner

366
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,270
must be full of tacit understanding and trust,

367
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,470
without any hesitation or resentment.

368
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,240
A friendship of life and death.

369
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,760
One thought may determine life and death.

370
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,910
It's up to you.

371
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,310
I don't know if I can do it.

372
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,870
Even now,

373
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm afraid to hold you back.

374
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,510
I trust you.

375
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,630
And there's still some time.

376
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,910
I need you to confirm

377
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:51,990
if you're willing

378
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,670
to pass the 12th door with me.

379
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,170
It's okay if you don't want to.

380
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,950
I won't force you.

381
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,270
No hurry.

382
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,670
Take your time.

383
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,750
There are still three days left.

384
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,310
Three days later, it will be Tan Zaozhao's fifth door.

385
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,840
If you've made up your mind,

386
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,110
let's go in together.

387
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,030
Hey.

388
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,070
I can answer you now.

389
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,350
I do.

390
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,720
It'll be too late to forget you

391
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,750
So quickly?

392
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,270
Isn't it too hasty?

393
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,670
It will happen sooner or later.

394
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,910
Just let it happen.

395
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,510
Thank you.

396
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,190
It's rare to hear you say thank you.

397
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,270
From now on,

398
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,190
look after me inside the doors.

399
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,510
Don't worry.

400
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,110
I'll protect you.

401
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,390
I'll protect you forever.

402
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,360
Until your life comes to an end,

403
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,380
or my life comes to an end.

404
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,180
Please stop counting down the time

405
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,750
I'm afraid I'll do anything

406
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,910
Come in.

407
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,030
Where's Ruan?

408
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,270
Important guests are here.

409
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,270
Why didn't he come out to welcome us?

410
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,450
Have a seat.

411
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,670
Okay.

412
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,790
What time is it?

413
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,550
I still have a lot of things about passing the door

414
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,390
to tell you.

415
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,670
I got ready long ago.

416
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,020
I was waiting for them.

417
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,550
They insisted on giving you the movie ticket.

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,190
Yes, I have the ticket.

419
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,150
Yiqing's movie is about to be released.

420
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,510
I've watched the version that hasn't been released yet.

421
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,430
It's so exciting.

422
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,430
You must watch it.

423
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,870
Yiqing is really talented.

424
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,270
I really like him.

425
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,040
So many people here.

426
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,150
Thank you for introducing him to me.

427
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,400
I didn't expect you two to be like this.

428
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,510
You even got your nails done.

429
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,290
You weren't like this before.

430
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,550
Zaozao, stop laughing.

431
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,120
You're about to enter the fifth door soon.

432
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,790
We really can't take you through

433
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,720
the sixth door.

434
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,670
Just enjoy while I can.

435
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,040
You must be Ling Jiushi, right?

436
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,990
I heard a lot about you from Ruan these days.

437
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,070
If we meet inside the door,

438
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,500
remember to take care of each other.

439
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm leaving.

440
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,510
Tan Zaozao,

441
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,120
you still want to leave?

442
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,790
Then we will leave first.

443
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,670
I'll see you off.

444
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,790
Ruan,

445
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,030
I can't completely give up my work in the real world

446
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,030
like you do

447
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,830
and focus on studying this game.

448
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,270
And I don't have the guts

449
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,890
to keep passing the door to gain experience.

450
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,630
Besides, after the sixth door,

451
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,920
the difficulty of the door will change completely.

452
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,310
No one can escape unscathed.

453
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,150
What can I do?

454
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Am I right?

455
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,750
So, you stay here

456
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,390
and study your fifth door,

457
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,560
the lady in the rain.

458
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,430
You want to ask about Mengmeng?

459
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,160
Xia and I just talked about her.

460
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,350
Listen to Xia.

461
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,150
Just say it.

462
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,960
The one who killed Mengmeng

463
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,910
is the one you've always wanted to recruit.

464
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,870
Nonsense!

465
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,630
Listen to Xia first.

466
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,710
In order to test the taboo inside the door,

467
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,150
Ling Jiushi intentionally let Mengmeng

468
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,210
eat the food brought in from outside.

469
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,370
Then she was killed by the Door Ghost.

470
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,870
The people I sent in

471
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,170
were also killed inside the door by their trickery.

472
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,970
You treated them as good friends,

473
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,630
but they didn't treat you as good friends.

474
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,550
There is no friendship

475
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,750
in the game.

476
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They all resort to every expedient.

477
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,670
Do you have evidence?

478
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,670
It's a secret,

479
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,370
but it's reliable.

480
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,740
I'll find out now.

481
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,870
They even use dirty means to to create obstacles for others,

482
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,310
do you think they will tell you the truth?

483
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,790
Xiong Qi,

484
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,270
calm down.

485
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,370
I'm also surprised

486
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,230
I was wrong about him.

487
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,570
But it doesn't matter.

488
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,150
I don't want him.

489
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,990
I want results,

490
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,430
understand?

491
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,830
I want you to pass 12 doors as soon as possible.

492
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,850
I know you're under pressure.

493
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,910
Me too.

494
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,350
Danny doesn't give me much time.

495
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,990
If you can't pass 12 doors,

496
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,390
I won't be able to get investment from America.

497
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,110
If I can't get investment from America,

498
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,950
I'll have a hard time,

499
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,750
and so do you guys.

500
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,870
Playing this game

501
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
with strength alone is useless.

502
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,470
You need this.

503
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,220
No wonder you and Ke keep having accidents inside the door.

504
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,820
Both of you are brainless.

505
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,030
Say it again.

506
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,030
Alright.

507
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,520
What's the use of arguing here?

508
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,200
Go inside the door if you dare.

509
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,550
Xiong Qi,

510
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,040
you're going inside the door soon.

511
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,670
I don't need to say much

512
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,350
about how important this door is to you.

513
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,310
Xia is the highest ranking among you.

514
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,410
You should learn more from her.

515
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,990
We are a team.

516
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,450
I don't want you to fight separately.

517
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,750
I won't learn such dirty tricks.

518
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,550
Say it

519
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,490
when you get out of the door alive.

520
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
Boss,

521
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,390
do you

522
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,040
still want to recruit Ling Jiushi?

523
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,910
What do you think?

524
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,150
The money should be enough to pay off your boyfriend's gambling debt.

525
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,150
Thank you, Xia.

526
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,030
Meishu,

527
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,390
you are about to go inside the door, right?

528
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,390
Yes.

529
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,520
The lady in the rain.

530
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,630
Don't worry, Xia.

531
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,650
I have a more detailed note

532
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,140
for this door.

533
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,070
Two people

534
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,970
will enter the same door with you.

535
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,280
You know what I mean.

536
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,030
Xia,

537
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,070
don't worry. I understand.

538
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,150
You is my good friend.

539
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,310
She and Jiang Yingrui can't die in vain.

540
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,950
Inside the door,

541
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,030
I'll do my best to act.

542
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,230
And our old friends and colleagues

543
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,150
will come inside to door too.

544
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,750
This door

545
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,659
should be in an old castle.

546
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,310
There are many strange things in the castle.

547
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,710
Don't touch them,

548
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,190
otherwise...

549
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,550
Tan Zaozao.

550
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,110
Yes.

551
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,530
Wake up and listen!

552
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,270
Lanzhu.

553
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,370
This is a portrait drawn by an European painter.

554
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,710
The story behind it is very special.

555
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,389
It went through three buyers.

556
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,790
And they all returned it.

557
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,190
They said

558
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,350
after buying this painting,

559
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,659
they were followed by a girl in black

560
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,000
like a shadow every day,

561
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,710
and even in dreams.

562
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,670
In the end, they couldn't stand it

563
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,530
and returned the painting to the painter in a panic.

564
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,630
This painting

565
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,590
is indeed not very likeable.

566
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,400
I also investigated the painting of the lady in the rain.

567
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,860
Not to mention the buyers,

568
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,350
during the exhibition of the artwork,

569
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,590
many audiences also experienced

570
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,630
emotional fluctuations and hallucinations.

571
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,430
And later on, the author of the painting

572
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,310
had serious mental problems.

573
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,480
The official statement is that

574
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,360
someone was jealous of the author

575
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,150
and added hallucinogenic drugs

576
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,670
into the paint and canvas she painted.

577
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,870
As for why this happened,

578
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,270
no one knows.

579
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,550
How is Yi Manman?

580
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,960
He kept asking for raw meat.

581
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,490
But they said it's under control.

582
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,820
Tan Zaozao

583
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,870
Ruan.

584
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,070
You would help me inside the door anyway.

585
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
Why am I afraid?

586
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,390
I really have something to do.

587
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,050
See you inside the door later.

588
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,990
Stop! Stop!

589
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,250
I'm King covers the ground tiger.

590
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,310
I'm Cheng of five feet tall.

591
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,950
Same team.

592
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,570
You're the one who contacted me on the forum.

593
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,750
Why were you sneaking around?

594
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,990
Is the deal above board?

595
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,090
If I call you on the street,

596
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,350
why did we contact each other secretly

597
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,550
on the forum?

598
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,870
You can call me.

599
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,710
Check your phone.

600
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,140
(All)

601
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,790
Sorry.

602
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,350
They asked me to silence my phone.

603
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,350
I forgot about it.

604
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,430
Did you bring the prop?

605
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,900
Do you think I'm stupid?

606
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,150
Buying and selling props is against the rules.

607
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,390
I have to check if you are a real buyer.

608
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,140
If you set me up,

609
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,230
I'll fall into your trap.

610
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,710
Darn.

611
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,350
I...

612
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,550
The prop is on the way.

613
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,270
I'll let you know when I get it.

614
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,870
Of course I'm a real buyer.

615
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,120
You don't even know who I am.

616
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
I don't know.

617
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,880
But the price has to be doubled.

618
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,670
Why?

619
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
Tripled.

620
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,030
I thought you don't know who I am.

621
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:52,840
I don't care.

622
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,290
You scared me just now.

623
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,850
I need to go to the hospital.

624
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,230
What are you talking about?

625
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,630
Ruan is more reliable.

626
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,790
Who?

627
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,390
Ruan Lanzhu?

628
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,530
You are from Obsidian?

629
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,350
We're good friends.

630
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,610
Are you closer to him than I am?

631
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Alright.

632
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,360
Since you're a friend of my good friend,

633
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,790
I won't charge you extra.

634
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,390
Also, I'll bring the prop to you

635
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,390
when I get it.

636
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,110
I'm going to enter a door soon.

637
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,770
I can't come here for nothing.

638
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,270
Take a look.

639
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,720
Are you interested in this?

640
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,070
This is also a prop in the door.

641
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,710
Thank you.

642
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,840
It's very precious.

643
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,520
What's the use of it?

644
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,480
I don't know.

645
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,790
At first, I thought

646
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,920
it could reflect damage or something.

647
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,790
But it didn't work.

648
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,790
But

649
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,120
you can take a look at yourself.

650
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,830
Can you stop talking nonsense?

651
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,800
Don't underestimate this prop.

652
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,270
Let me tell you.

653
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,950
It's important for girls to look in the mirror in the door.

654
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,990
What if

655
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,550
you see something in the mirror...

656
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,950
Stop. I'll keep it.

657
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,070
Thank you.

658
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,430
How do you pay?
