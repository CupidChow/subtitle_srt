00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,500
submarine

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm going to sleep

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm asking who marina is

5
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,480
Who are you?

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,320
Good night.

7
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,840
On this faraway road,

8
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,440
the higher the building, the closer it is.

9
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,920
The farther the distance is.

10
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
In the endless night,

11
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
I fall asleep.

12
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Let me accompany you to be lonely.

13
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Zhixian.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,720
The day and night are interspersed.

15
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,520
What's wrong?

16
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
When I'm alone,

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,720
the more I think about it,

18
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
the more empty my heart is.

19
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,360
If I can't find my way back after waking up,

20
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,400
let me accompany you to be lonely.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,280
The strange and gentle gaze

22
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,280
replace the loneliness I feel with you.

23
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,800
The starry sky in my eyes

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,000
is the wish in your heart.

25
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,520
A tearful past

26
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,800
is like a star.

27
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,880
The sun is going down.

28
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Are you staying for dinner?

29
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
You cook for me?

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,240
Sure.

31
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,680
But I only know how to cook ramen.

32
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,840
Ramen is fine.

33
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,800
But I don't cook ramen for free.

34
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,320
It's expensive.

35
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
Well,

36
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
how about this?

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,640
ramen

38
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,280
Only the noodles are expensive,

39
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,280
and noodle soup is best.

40
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,320
By the way,

41
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,840
the kind soup

42
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,760
comes from Drama Club brother.

43
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,280
It's Chinese.

44
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,440
You also fill them.

45
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,940
Rice.

46
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,020
Our names.

47
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,120
I hope no matter what happens,

48
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,480
that we've all got to face it.

49
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,320
Being careful

50
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,020
and be considerate.

51
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,980
It seems like I'm fleeing in a dream.

52
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,020
It will be more firm.

53
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,740
Song Ruan.

54
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,380
Please forgive me for my

55
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,780
impoliteness.

56
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,660
Please forgive me for my

57
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,540
hesitation and retreat.

58
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,020
Maybe it's because

59
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,020
I'm a bit stubborn

60
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,620
and not smart enough.

61
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,660
I just realized that

62
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
you're the one who can

63
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,580
help me go back to the past

64
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,060
and find my true self.

65
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,100
Thank you.

66
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,740
I love you.

67
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,540
I love you too.

68
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Life tells us that

69
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,300
it's easy for us to be happy.

70
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,540
No one can replace you.

71
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,940
I have a dream of you.

72
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,780
Goodbye until the dream ends.

73
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,140
When the next shooting

74
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,900
Song Ruan,

75
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,380
what are you filming?

76
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,580
You don't have any news.

77
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,820
Now the three-person video

78
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,100
is spreading everywhere.

79
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,940
The more you watch it,

80
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,900
the more you will be

81
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,340
exposed to the private life.

82
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,220
Do you understand?

83
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,180
Chief Cui,

84
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,900
I won't film the material

85
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,660
you want.

86
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,580
You can find someone else.

87
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,740
It's not up to you.

88
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,220
I'm warning you.

89
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,060
If you don't get the material

90
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,900
I want,

91
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,860
I will add to your

92
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,020
failure and

93
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,580
failure to achieve your goal.

94
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,260
Without this practical report,

95
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,900
you may not even get your graduation certificate.

96
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,700
But Chu Xingyan

97
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,580
never did

98
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,700
what you said.

99
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,380
I can't go to

100
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,420
make false accusations

101
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,220
and frame him.

102
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,420
This will have a bad effect

103
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,780
on his career.

104
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,660
You are a pirate.

105
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,460
You deserve this.

106
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,540
He is not.

107
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,140
I will find evidence

108
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,940
to prove

109
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Chu Xingyan's innocence.

110
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,100
Zou Ran.

111
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,140
Are you interested

112
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
in making a deal with me?

113
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,460
A deal?

114
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,380
You are the one

115
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,540
who is in charge

116
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,460
of organizing

117
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,380
Chu Xingyan's

118
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,580
documentary, right?

119
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,980
I want to buy it.

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,380
You can bargain with me.

121
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,180
No.

122
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,620
What are you doing?

123
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,060
You can ask me anything.

124
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm not interested.

125
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,020
You can ask me anything.

126
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,660
I can give you

127
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,700
what Chu Xingyan can give you.

128
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,780
Even more.

129
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,180
Please keep your distance.

130
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,340
If you get closer,

131
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,140
I will call someone.

132
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,380
You are so arrogant.

133
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,180
Do you think he really

134
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,420
takes you seriously?

135
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,180
He just wants to

136
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,580
use you as a weapon

137
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,580
to make him angry.

138
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,700
He is not that kind of person.

139
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,740
He is your Jiang Feng,

140
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,060
who used fake news

141
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,500
to suppress his opponent.

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,300
You can't

143
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,860
be so straightforward.

144
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,860
You are protecting him.

145
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,060
Do you really think he will be grateful?

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,860
Don't be naive.

147
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
Don't think that you have a chance

148
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,300
to work for him.

149
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,420
He admitted it

150
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,180
in front of the media

151
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,300
a few days ago.

152
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,220
He already has someone he likes.

153
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,260
You are just

154
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,460
an ordinary intern.

155
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,660
Don't think that

156
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,980
you are a bad guy.

157
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
Miss Zong.

158
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,340
You can tell what is good

159
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,700
and what is bad

160
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,660
to benefit you.

161
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
It has nothing to do

162
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,580
with you.

163
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,020
Don't refuse me so soon.

164
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,060
If you agree to my conditions,

165
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,060
I can give you a million yuan first.

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,980
How about it?

167
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,220
Sell the video to me

168
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,340
and earn some money

169
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,900
so that in the end,

170
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,100
you will have more money.

171
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,900
I will have more money

172
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,340
after I listen to you.

173
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,380
Be careful that I report you online.

174
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,260
Fine, I will come.

175
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,700
Not abed laptops!

176
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,660
I dreamt of your face

177
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Under the starlight, I slightly feel hot

178
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,660
I want to walk with you

179
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,660
The long waiting of the four seasons

180
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Let's go eat

181
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Come here

182
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
These two days, I've been researching

183
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Two female models' social media platforms

184
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,660
I finally found a meaning to my name

185
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
So amazing

186
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Yes, in terms of catching small numbers

187
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Every woman is a detective

188
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Did this scene appear in your MV?

189
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
This is my suite

190
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
They went there at night

191
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
How could they take pictures here during the day?

192
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Look at the release time of this photo

193
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,660
This should be after your MV was shot

194
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Is there a possibility that

195
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,660
They entered this suite after you left the room?

196
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Look at the date

197
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
It's only three months left

198
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Two days

199
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Hotel surveillance

200
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,660
The night that is full of clouds

201
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,660
At least I am alone with you

202
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,660
The sun behind the moonlight

203
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Is the answer in your heart

204
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,660
The answer in your heart

205
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,660
A long wait in the hotel
