My Girlfriend II

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,400
Stop drinking if you can't drink.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Who said I can't drink?

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Who said that?

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,000
I said that.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Shuyan, drink it.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Xing Yan's stomach is at the bedside.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
Help me take it.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Does it still hurt?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Drink some water.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Drink it all.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
If you keep drinking,

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
your stomach will be empty.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Those fat bosses are really

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,400
hard to get used to.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
If I don't drink it,

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
they can't let you go.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Follow Song Ran.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,600
What kind of life are you pretending to be now?

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,800
You're already drunk like this.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm not like that.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
I know what I'm doing.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm everywhere.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,400
You...

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
If you give me two more beers,

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
can I still get some?

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,200
I'll just take it.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Get some?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Get some?

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Get some?

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Get some?

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
It hurts.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Get some?

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
It hurts.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Does it still hurt?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Does it still hurt?

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
You have to pay for everything.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
The more you want,

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
the more you lose.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
I just want to

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
act well

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,800
and be an ordinary actor.

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
It's not that easy.

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Enough.

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
All these years,

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
no matter how much you've suffered for the performance,

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
I've seen it in your eyes.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
God won't let down

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
someone who fights for his dream.

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
But

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
we have to take it step by step.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Health is the first priority.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
If you keep drinking like this,

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
your stomach will be empty.

56
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
You can only play the patient.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Your heart will be narrow.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Can you stop cursing me?

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm taking medicine.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
That's good.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Medicine.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're taking medicine?

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
Hurry up.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Chu Xing Yan,

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,400
what kind of person are you?

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
How is the sunshine?

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Can you shoot the backlight?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Just go forward.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's pretty.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
You can shoot the backlight.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
I can't shoot the backlight.

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
I can't shoot the backlight.

73
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
You can shoot the backlight.

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
What are you looking at?

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Don't run.

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Wait for a while.

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
We have another group of people.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
We have another group.

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
There is another group.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
You shoot a few good-looking people.

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Slow down.

82
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Wait, it's you again.

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
Wait.

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a dog with a very strong temperament.

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
He seems to be a little scared.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Come on.

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
What did you study in college?

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I studied to be a director.

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
Chu Xingyan.

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,240
Are you free tonight?

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,800
I want to treat you to dinner.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,760
Okay.

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
I cooked a few dishes.

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,760
Although it may not be as good as Michelin's,

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,520
at least you don't have to worry about the reporters here.

96
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,320
It's okay.

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
I don't eat Michelin's every day.

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,680
You live here alone?

99
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,080
How could it be such a big house?

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,440
I live with my best friend.

101
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
But he asked someone out today.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,520
You deliberately drove him away?

103
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,080
Don't talk nonsense.

104
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,800
He'll be back soon.

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Don't be impulsive.

106
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,720
Sit down.

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,000
I cooked quite well.

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,440
And I like fried eggs.

109
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,280
I treat you today.

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,640
I drink wine.

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,760
You drink tea.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,400
You drink wine. I drink tea.

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,480
Okay.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
I can't drink it.

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
I'll drink some.

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,080
You can only drink tea today.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

118
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
Try it.

119
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,160
You cook so many delicious dishes.

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,680
You treat me so well.

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,400
What are you doing?

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Congratulations to actor Chu Xingyan

123
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,400
on his sixth anniversary.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Okay.

125
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,760
Slow down.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
Don't drink it.

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,280
Cheers.

128
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
Cheers.

129
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,160
Thank you.

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,600
But I only debuted four years ago.

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
But six years ago,

132
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,160
you performed a play for the first time in school.

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,680
How do you know that?

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm your documentary director.

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Of course I know you well.

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,560
Actually, I want to tell you today

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,880
that persistence is a very precious spirit.

138
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,920
You're so successful now.

139
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
You haven't forgotten your original intention of being an actor.

140
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,680
You're really great.

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
So,

142
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
you must never give up.

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,600
You will become a very good actor.

144
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Still drinking?

145
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,440
Okay.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,920
Actually, I have one more thing to ask you today.

147
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
What?

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
Chu Xingyan.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,760
You like to flirt with people.

150
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you really like me?

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,600
Or is it just a game?

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,640
You're drunk after drinking two bottles.

153
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I'm not drunk.

154
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm just drunk.

155
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,640
Okay, enough.

156
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
Stop being drunk.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
I really want to be with you!

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
I want to be with you!

159
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
Isn't your performance

160
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
not my style?

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
Or

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
What kind of person am I in your heart?

163
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
A...

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
A star that you just want to conquer?

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Or a colleague who just works together?

166
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
You...

167
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Are you sincere about what you said to me before?

168
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Did you say that to all the stars?

169
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Or did you say it casually?

170
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
You...

171
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I remember how you look now.

172
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
You must be drunk.

173
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
We made a promise

174
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,360
We will never part again

175
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,360
We will never think about the safety distance

176
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Lying in your arms

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Giving me all the courage

178
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Waiting for the next shooting star

179
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Watching the time change

180
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Look through your eyes

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Travel with me

182
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Don't think about the deep and hard to understand

183
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Here, at this moment, only me and you exist

184
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Is it happy to be forgotten?

185
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,360
If I carry the white hair of longing with me

186
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Let me be alone with you

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,360
The night that is so dark

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,360
At least I want to be alone with you

189
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,360
The sun behind the moonlight

190
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Is the answer in your heart

191
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,360
A big and heavy rain
