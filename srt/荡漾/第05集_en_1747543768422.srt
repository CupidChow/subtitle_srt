00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To love To heal

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is...

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am...

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It has nothing to do with you.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Er Ran.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come here.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My life is messed up.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Xinyan, it's been three years.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're still mad at me?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Miss Lin, we're not even close.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't say things that make people misunderstand.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you have to be so cold to me?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're going to work together.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When we go back to the past,

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be the heroine of this movie.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We'll be working together for three months.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I really hope we can be like before.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Get along well, okay?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll be happy.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a good thing to be in a movie.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's no need to act in private.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You and Lin Hao Hao knew each other before?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're a ex-girlfriend?

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you jealous?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't worry.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're not in a relationship.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't be so self-conceited.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm starting from a work perspective.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to enrich your character.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Song Ren.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You admit you like me,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but you're so cold to me, right?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Work time?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please focus on your work.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't let anything get out of hand.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Did I tell you last time?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm the same to all men.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm all all bullshit.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I love you so much.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,680
Why are our countries surrounded by capital G?

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
pitiful

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,400
I was complete

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,080
I am White hustle

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Almost

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,040
Song ouran

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,320
Is the women also microwave?

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,300
How dare you!

50
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,700
And I told you

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:33,520
that you can't leave at

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,100
Can be not

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,160
You are so lazy

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,860
But luckily

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm not doing this for you.

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,180
Okay.

57
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,460
I'll go to the bathroom.

58
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,220
Okay.

59
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,100
Bye.

60
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,260
See you later.

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,300
Bye.

62
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Bye.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,460
Bye.

64
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
Bye.

65
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
Bye.

66
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
Bye.

67
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Bye.

68
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
Bye.

69
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,460
Bye.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
Bye.

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Bye.

72
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,460
Bye.

73
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
Bye.

74
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Bye.

75
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Bye.

76
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,460
Bye.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Bye.

78
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Bye.

79
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Bye.

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Bye.

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
Bye.

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Bye.

83
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Bye.

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
It's been three years.

85
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Why can't you forget him?

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
He hurt you so badly.

87
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Jiang Fang.

88
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
This is between me and Xin Yan.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
It's none of your business.

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
It's been so many years.

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Don't you understand my feelings for you?

92
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Hao Hao.

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,080
I know you've always been nice to me.

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
But Xin Yan is my first love.

95
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
I just want to go back to the way we were.

96
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
There are many reporters outside.

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
You should go back.

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
It's not good to be photographed.

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Jiang Fang.

101
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
This movie is really important to me.

102
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
I don't want anything to happen to it.

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
If you really want me to be good,

104
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
then finish it with me.

105
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Okay?

106
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Just wait and see.

107
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Hao Hao.

108
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
I'll let you know that

109
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
I'm the only one who deserves to be your male lead.

110
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Okay.

111
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Okay.

112
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Bye.

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
I'll tell my life

114
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,840
to tell you that happiness

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,600
is easy to achieve.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
No one can replace

117
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,080
the dream of having you.

118
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
See you again

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,960
until the dream ends.

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,280
Waiting for the summer to pass.

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,160
Watch the time change

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,960
through your eyes.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Travel with me.

124
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,360
Don't think about the deep and hard to understand truth.

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,960
At this moment, there is only you and me.

126
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:42,200
At this moment, there is only you and me.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,080
Come on!

128
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you for listening to my new song.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,040
I hope I can not only give you a beautiful experience,

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,520
but also share with you

131
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,920
my inner world.

132
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,240
This is the first time I tried to make my own lyrics.

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,480
Sometimes the fate of people is really wonderful.

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,560
I used to think that my heart was a lake.

135
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,480
No matter how big the storm,

136
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
it will remain calm.

137
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,440
But there is a person

138
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,640
who suddenly appeared in my life

139
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,360
and made this lake

140
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,720
rise again.

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,160
Is that person

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,640
you?

143
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes!

144
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,720
You have to calm down. You have to wake up.

145
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm not talking to you.

146
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
What's wrong?

147
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,680
You're rubbing against my arm.

148
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,840
Was my performance not bad?

149
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
How is that possible?

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,200
It's just average.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,680
What's wrong with you?

152
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
Do you think

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,840
my confession to you was right?

154
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
What confession?

155
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
I...

156
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,200
I didn't hear anything.

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
What are you doing again?

158
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,920
Water.

159
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,320
Have you made up your mind?

160
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,360
Yes.

161
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,360
The last time I met you before,

162
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,560
I wanted to learn your power.

163
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,800
Do you want to be my partner for that?

164
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,920
Then I have to try.

165
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
Not necessary.

166
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Really don't know whether I canそう it.

167
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,280
You can do it if you have difficulty,

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,920
but you still have some routine left.

169
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,360
Because today is gonna be azure

170
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
for onechuckling you,

171
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,240
I'll do my best to make it difficult for you.

172
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,760
After this,

173
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,960
I...

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,760
I think I must have done something not good enough.

175
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Mr. Chu, please be careful.

176
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,360
Don't think that you're a star and you can keep getting close to me.

177
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
You're late.

178
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,360
You...

179
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,960
You...

180
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
I... I'm here to work.

181
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
Don't mention what happened yesterday.

182
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,760
What happened?

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
I've forgotten.

184
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,760
You're still reminding me?

185
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
It's best if you forget.

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
Don't think about anyone else.

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,960
Let's go.

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Aren't we going to the horse farm?

189
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,160
Let's go.

190
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Aren't we going to the horse farm?

191
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,580
Mantis

192
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,440
Endure thinly, a gentle touch of Tarot

193
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,120
to you vs the back ocean

194
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:30,360
When the full moon shines, it stages the the launched queen

195
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,280
The wind does not smell like theoodle

196
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,900
You always long to meet

197
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:45,500
love you always long and wait

198
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,020
This skill has made a significant progress.

199
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,220
The angle of the foot is also quite detailed.

200
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,260
It's different.

201
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Thank you for your compliment.

202
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,820
It's mainly because I'm good at horse riding.

203
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,700
But...

204
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,940
I still like your original appearance.

205
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,620
What was my original appearance?

206
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,940
You're objective and casual.

207
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,980
You can't just say it.

208
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,380
But liking someone is just loving someone.

209
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,500
Its advantages and disadvantages are all covered up.

210
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,220
You're just saying it.

211
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,340
Why do you always say such strange things?

212
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,980
Let's end it here for today.

213
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,700
Goodbye.

214
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,220
What are you doing? Move aside.

215
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,140
You want to escape again?

216
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,060
I...

217
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,420
Do you know that escaping is also a way to like someone?

218
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,740
If you're like this, I'm afraid you'll dream of me at night.

219
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,660
How can I dream of you?

220
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,300
Really.

221
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,340
I...

222
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,220
Xing Yan.

223
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,020
Before the movie is released, we have to hold an internal night party.

224
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,220
All the main creators, actors, and investors have to participate.

225
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
The time is tomorrow night.

226
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,380
Take a look at the schedule.

227
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,460
If there's nothing else, go.

228
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,220
Okay.

229
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,220
Don't dream.

230
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,940
I'm not dreaming.

231
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,700
Wait.

232
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,920
He still remembers his crime,

233
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,360
but in the end,

234
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,020
he saved the whole world.

235
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,640
That's why

236
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,620
the culprit...

237
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,160
is 종� transforms to those with power.

238
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,840
It's like a moon

239
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,140
built as aち

240
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
to switch.

241
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,080
Then there must be some help.

242
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,340
Fine.

243
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,960
Tang Yeshua.

244
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,280
Be quick.

245
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,760
I will give me some help.

246
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
What's with you?

247
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,920
With the clothes you dropped in the New Year,

248
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,440
you will never do me any favors.

249
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,920
If you want가지고

250
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,980
we can start over.

251
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,220
Look after fix dark and light

252
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,340
Be my chain, be my skin

253
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,220
Burning from the taste

254
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Why do you disarray my eyes

255
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm dying, I always keep

256
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,100
Until my heart is empty

257
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,140
Together, broken

258
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,220
Brotherhood

259
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,580
I'm not happy, I'm lonely

260
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,180
Scat

261
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Let me be alone with you

262
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,980
The night without you

263
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,980
At least I'll be alone with you

264
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,980
The sun behind the moonlight

265
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Is the answer in your heart

266
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,980
A big ice-cold play
