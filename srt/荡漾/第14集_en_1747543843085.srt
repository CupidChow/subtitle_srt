1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I love you.

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
I like you.

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Should we

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960
be together?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Be my boyfriend?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Xing Yan!

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have good news for you.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You are selected by the crew.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Really?

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I said you would be fine.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Although it's just a small trick,

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will do my best

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to choose a good role.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's just a beginning.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will wait for you in a better and bigger role.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you for giving me such a good opportunity.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't say that.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's celebrate.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What do you want to eat?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to eat...

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
fried chicken.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't cry.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I only have to be in the crew to play the role of soy sauce.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can't get a good role.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If I am in the crew,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't deserve you.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't listen to them.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's take it step by step.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now we are at the foundation.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you think so,

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you will have more chances.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I said I can play the role of soy sauce.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not up to them.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I must hit them hard.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You look beautiful today.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do I look good?

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You look good every day.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's wrong?

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Xing Yan, go to the canteen first.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have something to do.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's that? Do you need me to accompany you?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I have a little stomach.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a little uncomfortable.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to go back and see him first.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then you go quickly.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Send me a message later.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chu Xing Yan.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How are you today?

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not with you.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She...

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She is not with me.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She...

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
She just left.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Aren't you uncomfortable?

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who said that?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Maybe you heard it wrong.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's okay.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm really sorry.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Quickly,

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
quickly.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Quickly,

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Gateway.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Robert.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Zhengyue.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where isedi'

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Weird.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Weird.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
I lost my graduation certificate.

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
A graduation certificate is like a piece of paper.

113
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,560
In our circle,

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
who will judge us?

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,720
That's our school graduation.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
We've been together for a long time.

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
I want to be like that, too.

118
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,080
You haven't graduated yet.

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
You're the center of discussion for everyone.

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
I am.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
Yi Wen is your girlfriend.

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,360
I don't want to be a copycat.

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
I also want to be the Lin Hao Hao

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
that others introduce to me one day,

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
but not Chu Xin Yan's girlfriend.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm afraid

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
there will be some differences

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,480
and some smiles.

129
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,800
Why didn't you say it earlier?

130
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
Why should I say it?

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,800
You forgot to know.

132
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't want to...

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
I've signed a new female lead today.

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
By my own way,

135
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
I can also stand on a very important position.

136
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
I know.

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,920
It's the Liu Zuo who has been

138
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
doing things to you.

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
I see the opportunity.

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
Why are you jealous?

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,480
Do you know what you're doing?

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,360
I know.

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
What about our relationship?

144
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,360
The feeling is like that picture.

145
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,120
No one will care.

146
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
In this world,

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
except your mother,

148
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
no woman will love you purely.

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
Let's break up.

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,120
Chu Xin Yan!

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
You just don't understand my good.

152
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,560
Remember,

153
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,560
it's not you who dumped me today.

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
It's me who's better. I don't want you anymore.

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
I can learn to walk

156
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,440
again quickly

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,840
Chu Xin Yan!

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Chuminister has truly asked me to dituse

159
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,240
every time you universe and trifling all these by boy

160
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Chu Xinyan, what do you mean?

161
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
I have to deal with my business first.

163
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Chu Xinyan.

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Chu Xinyan.

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Chu Xinyan.

166
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,360
Chu Xinyan.

167
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,520
Is the video we uploaded online true?

168
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
What's your relationship with the video?

169
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,360
Chu Xinyan.

170
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,520
Say something.

171
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Say something.

172
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,400
Yes, say something to us.

173
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,200
Say something.

174
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
Say something.

175
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,280
Chu Xinyan, say something to us.

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,360
Say something to us.

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Is there any impact on the video?

178
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
Is the video's promotion

179
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
affected by the video?

180
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
We are still investigating

181
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,080
the incident of the video.

182
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,840
When the investigation is over,

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,480
we will give you a clear answer.

184
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,880
What?

185
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,640
We are still investigating the incident.

186
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,240
After the investigation,

187
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,840
we will give you a clear answer.

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Please go back.

189
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,160
Are you insulting us?

190
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,120
We are investigating the incident online.

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Can't you say something?

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
Chu Xinyan.

193
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Chu Xinyan, can you...

194
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Will your male lead be sold out?

195
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,040
Chu Xinyan, will this video

196
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
make your male lead be sold out?

197
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
Is it the hotel's property?

198
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,760
Many reporters

199
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,840
are surrounding Chu Xinyan's house.

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,600
It has seriously affected

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Mr. Chu's normal life.

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
You are such a big brand.

203
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
In terms of privacy,

204
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
there is such a big hole.

205
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,320
I believe you will be done within ten minutes.

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,520
Xinyan, where have you been?

207
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,960
Do you know that I am worried about you?

208
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,560
I went out for a walk.

209
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,640
Recently, the reporters are watching you.

210
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
It's too dangerous for you to go out alone.

211
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You are in a bad mood.

212
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,720
It's normal for you to go out for a walk.

213
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
But can you tell me in advance next time?

214
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,840
I can prepare for it urgently.

215
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,120
I am sorry.

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
I won't do it next time.

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,680
I am not blaming you.

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,080
I am just worried about you.

219
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,200
I know.

220
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
I am fine.

221
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
Xinyan.

222
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
I said...

223
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
I am worried about you.

224
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Can you understand what I mean?

225
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,760
So where did you go last night?

226
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,880
I went to Song Ruan's house.

227
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
It's Song Ruan again.

228
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Do you like him?

229
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,440
How can you like him?

230
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,360
I have known you for three years.

231
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,600
I have always been with you.

232
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,680
How long have you known him?

233
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,080
He is just an ordinary ordinary person.

234
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
What's wrong with you?

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't you understand?

236
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,760
Don't you understand my heart today?

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,400
I am not like you.

238
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,560
I am just a normal ordinary person.

239
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
I am just a normal ordinary person.

240
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,160
Do you understand my heart?

241
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Chu Xinyan.

242
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,640
I like you.

243
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,720
I have given up many opportunities...

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,440
to protect you wholeheartedly.

245
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,440
I just hope that...

246
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
when you have seen the snow and the wind,

247
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
you will find that my heart is always flowing.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
You will know that...

249
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,520
only I understand you and love you the most.

250
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,240
Chu Yan.

251
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,120
I have always regarded you as my best partner.

252
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,360
But I am a woman too.

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
I long for love.

254
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,360
I long for the person I like to see me.

255
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,720
I long for a close and trustworthy relationship.

256
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
Chu Yan.

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
But you are the person I trust the most.

258
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,360
It's hard for me to marry someone you know.

259
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,920
Then why can't I?

260
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
He is different.

261
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,880
He is...

262
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,680
the person who I can show everything to.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I am gazing at you.

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,440
I was so close to you.

265
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,040
But you look far away.

266
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,280
But it's a very complicated thing.

267
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,160
I can't explain it.

268
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,680
I don't even know

269
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
what I'm thinking about.

270
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,240
But I'm sure

271
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
all these years of your efforts,

272
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,480
all these little things,

273
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,160
I'll keep them in my heart.

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,840
Without you,

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,120
I can never

276
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
reach the height I am now.

277
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm very grateful to you.

278
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,440
But I'm grateful

279
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
to love.

280
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm being too straightforward.

281
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,040
I really

282
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,200
don't want you to misunderstand me.
