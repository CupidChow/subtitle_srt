00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Girlfriend

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Wow, it's so amazing.

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm here to ask you about your shooting plan for tomorrow.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,700
After all, you're in charge of my solo documentary.

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,000
I have to make an appointment with you in advance.

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,200
Can I sit for a while?

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Sure, sure, sure.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Chu Xingran!

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
Song Ruan is really a celebrity.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
So amazing.

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,600
So handsome.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
So handsome.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
So handsome.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
So handsome.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
What did you say?

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
You're Chu Xingran?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Is he your ex-boyfriend?

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Don't talk nonsense.

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,400
I'm just a tutor in Song Ruan's class.

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
You're so timid.

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,000
What's wrong?

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Can you go back and discuss the shooting plan?

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Okay.

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
So handsome.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Really?

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
They really have a lot to do.

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
I haven't got the autograph yet.

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
Why didn't you ask me before?

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Why didn't you ask me before?

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
No way.

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you for today.

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm going in now.

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Good night.

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Just one sentence?

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Say one more sentence.

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm also sorry for today.

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Today is also the last moment to decide.

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Besides, you're right.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to learn to face some bad things.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then have you let go?

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
What?

44
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,000
Let go of those people who are bad to me

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
so that they can open up to me.

46
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm going in now.

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
Go home early.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm going in now.

49
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Go home early.

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Go home early.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
Go home early.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Go home early.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Go home early.

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Go home early.

55
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Go home early.

56
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Go home early.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Go home early.

58
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Go home early.

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Go home early.

60
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Go home early.

61
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Go home early.

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Go home early.

63
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Go home early.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Go home early.

65
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,000
Where are we? Why aren't we back yet?

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
We're on our way. We'll be there soon.

67
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,000
Hurry up. I'm starving.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
I know.

69
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
You're back.

70
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
You...

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Chu Xin Yan, what are you doing?

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
You're shameless! You're so mean!

73
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
Who are you to kiss me like that?

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Hey.

75
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,900
Su Shift,

76
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,400
I didn't think that I would ever believe in love again.

77
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Until I met you.

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I Afraid that I have to calm down

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,000
and that I will affect your life.

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,200
But I found out that I was more afraid that you would leave me.

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
We could be together forever.

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,460
My first previous face...

83
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,400
happen to be the one that she likes.

84
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,360
Her every move in the yard...

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,000
always comes out in my street pursuing her.

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Let's go

87
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,460
Let's go

88
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,020
What happened?

89
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,420
Honey

90
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,980
See the news

91
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,900
Chu Qingyan

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
in the hotel.

93
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Impossible.

94
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
He's not that kind of person.

95
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
I found the surveillance video of the hallway,

96
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,760
but the hotel's surveillance footage

97
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,720
will be covered every 3 months.

98
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,100
The surveillance footage

99
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,560
was covered a few days ago.

100
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,580
This video must have been edited by someone,

101
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
but we can't find evidence.

102
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
He said that those two people only stayed for 2 minutes.

103
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
How could they leave at 5 a.m.

104
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
You also believe in what a man says?

105
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
Look, the internet is on fire now.

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,400
Even the partner that Chu Xin Yan is working with

107
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,320
has made a statement to cancel the contract.

108
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,000
You must make it clear. Don't let him fool you.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
I'm going to find him.

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,840
What about those two female models?

111
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,160
They ran away. They said they were out of work.

112
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,360
They disappeared. They can't contact them.

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,920
Xin Yan, it's obvious that someone has planned to frame you.

114
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,680
We are very passive right now.

115
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Did you do this?

116
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,680
What can I do?

117
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,080
I can force Chu Xin Yan to open the door for those two models.

118
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,560
I can force her to spend the night with them.

119
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,040
The video was taken so clearly.

120
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Haohao, accept the reality.

121
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,120
Maybe she is not the Chu Xin Yan she used to be.

122
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Impossible. Impossible.

123
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't be sad.

124
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,200
You still have me.

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,960
You still have me.

126
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,680
The number you have dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

127
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,760
The number you have dialed cannot be connected at the moment.

128
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,960
The long white hair of yearning

129
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,760
makes me feel lonely with you

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,160
In the night that is so dark

131
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I feel lonely with you

132
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,160
The sun behind the moonlight

133
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,560
is the answer in your heart

134
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,440
A big ice-shaking palace
