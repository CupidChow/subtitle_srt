00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
According to the date of the photo of the INS,

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I found the two models.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then I entered the hotel corridor surveillance of the suite.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I clearly photographed their entry and exit time.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They were deliberately disguised

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
as leaving the new room.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And they performed repeatedly at the door of the room.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I took three shots.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I finally chose the first version

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and cut it into the video of the three-person video of the victim.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, with this surveillance,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it proves that you were maliciously harmed.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have called the police.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I can soon catch the person who framed you.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's great.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then, we will send the surveillance video to the PR company.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Soon, everyone will know that you are innocent.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sister Na has already informed me

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
that the movie will start normally according to the original plan.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Congratulations, Xing Yan.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
From now on,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
no one can call my boyfriend

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
a thug.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When I was young, my family was very strict.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Everything was arranged by my mother.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The only happy thing was that

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
my father brought me here to ride a horse.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your mother is too strict.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
She thinks riding a horse is a waste of time.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I am very envious of those

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
who are free on the horse farm.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I will never forget one day

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
when my father secretly stole my father's car.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was so happy.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That day, my father secretly brought me here to ride a horse.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was like how I am bringing you here now.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But not long after,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
when I just learned how to ride a horse,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
my mother found out.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
She had a big fight with my father.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She said that she shouldn't have brought me here.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But when I was young,

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was envious of children like you.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can get anything you want.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Unlike me,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have a toy.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to beg my mother.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's nothing.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I was young, I went to my neighbor's house to steal fruit.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was caught by a police officer.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was acting like a ghost at night.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Later, my father found out.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He broke several of my chains.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's great.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When I was young, I even ran away from home.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But the farthest place I went

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
was the door of the community.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Running away from home is also like running away from home.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why not?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's the only good thing.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The shop is about to reopen.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The time I spend with you

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
won't be long.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Miss Song.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hello?

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Miss Song.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm Chu Xing Yan's mother.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I want to buy you a meal tonight.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is that all right?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm fine, Auntie.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay. I'll send you the address.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She's a young lady who just came into my apartment.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,760
There's a small hotel in our house

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,800
with the best restaurants in the city

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
and the world's best chefs.

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,920
I hope Miss Song will like it.

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
Thank you, Mrs. Chu.

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,600
You're too kind.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,760
Hello, Chef.

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Miss Song, this way, please.

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Here, see what you want to eat.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Thank you.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
This is Evan, a chef who came back from France to study.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
He's good at cooking all kinds of top-notch Western dishes.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,480
We brought these ingredients from France.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,000
The cooking method is very complicated and the texture is very delicate.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Miss Song, you can try it.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
There are foreign words on it.

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't know them.

93
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,480
It's Spanish.

94
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Miss Song, take a look.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
If you don't like it,

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll ask them to change a Chinese-style menu.

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
No need, Mrs. Chu.

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
I can do it.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
In that case, I'll choose for you.

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Okay.

101
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,600
I'll have the one I usually eat.

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
Here, Miss Song.

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
You're welcome.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Please.

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Okay.

106
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
By the way, Miss Song,

107
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,840
I heard that your family also owns a restaurant.

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
Whenever you have a chance,

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
bring me to try it.

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,120
I usually like to try snacks from all over the world.

111
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,560
Our family is an outdoor farm.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,800
Snacks are like fried skewers and spicy hot pot.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,560
The price is relatively cheap.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,080
That should be very beautiful.

115
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Here, start.

116
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,400
Okay.

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
Miss Song,

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,640
if you have something to say, I'll just say it.

119
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,800
Okay.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll treat you as my goddaughter.

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
You don't have to work so hard anymore.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
You can choose from many positions in our company.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Also, give your parents a shop.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,640
Then your parents won't have to work so hard anymore.

125
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,040
What do you think?

126
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,400
Thank you, Mrs. Chu.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,720
But...

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,560
By the way, Miss Song,

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,360
what kind of boy do you like?

130
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,600
I have many friends who are good-looking.

131
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Mrs. Chu,

132
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,880
I appreciate your kindness.

133
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,360
But...

134
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,960
As long as you give up Chu Xing Yan.

135
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,840
Why?

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,800
Because...

137
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,720
you don't deserve it.

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,680
Okay.

139
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,240
Let's start.

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,680
Enjoy.

141
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,960
I'll treat you as my goddaughter.

142
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,880
You can choose from many positions in our company.

143
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,440
Also, give your parents a shop.

144
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,920
Then your parents won't have to work so hard anymore.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,760
What kind of boy do you like?

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,920
I have many friends who are good-looking.

147
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
I appreciate your kindness.

148
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,600
But...

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,160
As long as you give up Chu Xing Yan.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,040
Why?

151
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
Because...

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,640
you don't deserve it.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,960
If I can't even get my graduation certificate,

154
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,840
and I have to part with the Chu family,

155
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,280
can I really deserve it?

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Thank you, friends in the media,

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,920
and friends who care about movies all over the world.

158
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,480
Next, let's welcome the director, Lin Sen,

159
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,080
to tell us about the new journey of his movie.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
Thank you.

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,200
First of all, I'm honored to be the director.

162
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,160
After three months of preparation,

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,880
I finally meet you.

164
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Thank you for your support.

165
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,200
Now let me introduce our leading actor,

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,120
Chu Xing Yan.

167
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,680
Now, let Chu Xing Yan say a few words.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Thank you.

169
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,040
The first time I came to this city,

170
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,280
I felt her enthusiasm.

171
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,320
It's very suitable for our movie theme,

172
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
Back to the past, say I love you.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,080
I believe if it can really go back to the past,

174
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,200
this city must be full of beautiful memories.

175
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
I hope that when the movie is released,

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
it can meet everyone's expectations.

177
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Our beautiful heroine is so good.

178
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,720
What do you want to say to your fans,

179
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,960
and our lead actors?

180
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,600
Hello, everyone.

181
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,320
I'm actress Lin Hao Hao.

182
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm very happy and honored to be in this movie.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Thank you very much to the director and the actors

184
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,320
for giving me this opportunity.

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,800
The closer we get, the farther we get.

186
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,840
In this long night full of sleep,

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm left alone with you.

188
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,000
When the sun and the moon are at the bottom of the sky,

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,080
the more I think about it, the more I miss you.

190
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,680
I'm glad that I can't find my way home.

191
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,960
It's been a long time.

192
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm left alone with you.

193
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
Why are you so quiet?

194
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,280
I might not sleep well last night.

195
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,360
I want to ask you a question.

196
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,400
Hello, I want to see what you two are going to order.

197
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,320
She is waiting for me.

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,400
I've already ordered it.

199
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
You can start now.

200
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,480
The starry sky with the starry sky in my eyes.

201
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,720
It's the wish in your heart.

202
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,760
A part of the past that can't be erased.

203
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,040
It's usually a star.

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,960
At the moment when I'm trying to leave and go home,

205
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,440
is it happiness?

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,080
I want to be forgotten.

207
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:46,080
If I'm left alone with you,

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm left alone with you.

209
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,320
The night that is so dark and foggy.

210
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,360
At least I want to be alone with you.

211
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,360
The sun behind the moonlight.

212
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,680
It's the answer in your heart.

213
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,560
A big and heavy dream.
