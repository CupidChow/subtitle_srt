00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Love from the Ocean

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today, I want to take this opportunity to be with you.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,800
In this world, no one can happily do anything.

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
I can't. You can't either.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then what can we film?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Say something!

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What do you mean?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Your mother is quite strong.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't be unhappy. You're already so good.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Although you have some things that you're not happy about,

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you're rich. You even have a pretty girlfriend.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What girlfriend?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Miss Zhu. She's gentle, pretty, and sweet.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can I film your story?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you don't want to, then forget it.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I said forget it.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She's my agent.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you're not good at talking, then don't talk about love.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
President Le, I agreed to film the boy because

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I always thought the male lead was your brother, Liu Shu.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But now you suddenly told me that the male lead has become Chu Xin Yan.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Liu Shu's leg was broken a while ago.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He needs to rest for half a year.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We just set up Chu Xin Yan.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's a singer. Why should he be the male lead?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I, Jiang Feng, am his match.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He sings and plays.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But he's also from the acting department.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I've tried his acting. It's very good.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Plus, he has his own flow.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's our best choice.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
President Le, if he can be the male lead, why can't I?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My flow isn't bad.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And my plot can be cheaper than his.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why don't you consider me?

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Jiang Feng, this isn't a plot problem.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I know you're not on good terms with him.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But this movie is very important to our company.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You know me.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Everything is about the plot and the character.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't think about your feelings right now.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Since you insist on him being the male lead,

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll quit.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not acting anymore.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Jiang Feng,

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
your contract with the male lead was signed the earliest.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you want to break the contract now, you can.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Five times the contract.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not going to break it.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're just playing around.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Finish the movie first.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll recommend you a suitable role in the future.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And Chu Xin Yan's contract has been signed.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Unless she breaks the contract,

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't be the male lead.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Work well together.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I know.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're filming us.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The fans are outside. Don't disturb our filming.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, the fans are outside. We're filming.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You'll disturb our work.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The fans are outside. We're filming.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You'll disturb our work. Okay?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wait outside.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who are you?

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm a staff.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're wearing a badge. Are you a staff?

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't get a notice.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm the director of Chu Xin Yan's documentary.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know what's going on.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Tu Ruan.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Xin Yan.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let her in.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xin Yan.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm also here.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're hot.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Xin Yan.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're hot.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're filming inside.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Xin Yan.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're here now.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't seem to be late.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's good that I can get in.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Your fans are too crazy.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh my god.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's too scary.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hurry up and start filming.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was criticized by the lighting today.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There's not a single material that can be used now.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Xing.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When you're ready, tell me.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll get you a big actor.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No need.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There's a live one.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who?

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Get ready.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Get ready.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What do I need to get ready?

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Didn't you want to start filming earlier?

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Help me with a play.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is this?

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The one that's red is your lines.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know how to act.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's okay.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can read it.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This play is very important to me.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You help me with my work.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll help you with your work.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're friends now.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So many lines.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Just read it.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Get familiar with it.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I haven't done it yet.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to get someone else to do it.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Xia Luo Luo.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're the only one

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
who belongs to me.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Except you, there's no other girl.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You once asked me

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
if I have more shortcomings

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
or advantages.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I asked you if you have more shortcomings.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't care about that.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I like you.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I like you as long as you're here.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You also asked me

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
if you're the most beautiful girl

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
in this world.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In my heart,

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you are.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So you mean

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
you like me?

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Of course I like you.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I like you very much.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I like you very much.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is it love?

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's love.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's everything about me.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's my whole world.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There's no question.

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There's no kiss.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, cut.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, okay.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You just did it on purpose, right?

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What?

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You mean this?

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Miss Song.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're in the play.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're talented.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I've done everything you asked me to do.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Can we talk about the shooting plan now?

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Talk?

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Shake hands.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
She's a dog that needs a spiritual communication.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm so tired.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Now,

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
when I was a kid,

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
we had a wolf dog.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was old enough to die.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It hid in a corner.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It was not observed carefully.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It was observed on the spot.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It was then decided to shoot.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Song Rui,

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
your shooting is too casual.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You need to plan it.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Overall,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
the quality of the material is obvious.

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The strong reality

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
can make the audience's emotions fair.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, yes, yes.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're right.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I designed it myself.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Not bad.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I decided to increase the budget for this project.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Team Leader Cui,

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
in the next filming of the documentary,

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you need to pay attention

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to Chu Xin Yan's emotional life.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I received the news

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
that she has some emotional feelings.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We need to seize this opportunity

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and dig it up.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We need to make it big.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't worry.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I promise to be ready.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't worry.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I promise to be ready.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to be loved.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If I'm left with white hair again,

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
let me be alone with you.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In the night with the night fox,

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
at least I want to be alone with you.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The sun behind the moonlight

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is the answer in your heart.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A big screen finally shows the past.
