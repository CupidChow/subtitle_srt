00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Chu Xingyan.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The reason I'm holding this press conference today is to respond to some things.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think you've all heard about the so-called three-person video of me.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
I used to think that it was all fake, so there was no need to respond.

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
I can't fall into a self-proclaimed trap.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
But recently...

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
I met someone...

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,200
who made my heart flutter.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,000
I was afraid that this matter would hurt him, so I never dared to accept his love.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,200
But now, I want to make a change for him.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,400
At least, I won't make him feel that he's fallen for a coward.

15
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,800
So today, I want to clarify here that I, Chu Xingyan,

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,600
didn't have a girlfriend before, and I don't have one now.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
I won't do that kind of thing again.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,200
The videos that are circulating online are fake.

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I hope that you won't believe it and spread it.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Chu Xingyan finally responded!

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
The girl he mentioned is Lin Hehao, right?

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh my god, he's just showing off his love!

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,600
Although I can't control him, but the good guy CP is real!

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
If Lin Hehao forgives him, maybe he really hasn't done it before.

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
He's just a loser.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,600
He's the king of the sea, so Lin Hehao won't forgive him.

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
How do I explain the video?

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Jiayi!

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes!

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Lin Hehao is on air! He even sent a smiley face!

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
My CP is really getting a face!

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Who is the girl you mentioned in the press conference today?

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Who?

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
You didn't mention her name. How would I know?

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Just guess.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't guess.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
If you can't guess, then forget it.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Forget it.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Anyway, it's my...

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,800
girlfriend.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Hey, your girlfriend doesn't have a name?

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Her name is Song Niqiu.

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
What are you doing?

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
What's wrong?

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,000
You're not going home?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,400
We just officially got together.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
It's 8.30 p.m. now.

48
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,400
You're asking your girlfriend to go home at 8.30 p.m.

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I just don't want you to think that I'm...

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Okay.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
Please send me home.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Mr. Chu, what do you think?

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
What do you think?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,800
What do you think of him? He asked you to send me home.

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Come.

56
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to go home.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Are you really leaving?

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Are you kidding?

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
This secretary is acting really weird today.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Let's not talk about this happened today.

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
I really love him now.

62
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Thank you for beingуж

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,400
You also saved Long Ni, right?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
When did heُ

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
It's just that it's not the same.

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
You...

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you want to drink something?

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I want to drink water.

69
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Why are you so serious today?

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm afraid that I won't be able to go home for a week.

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
What do you mean by not being able to go home?

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
It's what you mean.

74
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm afraid that I won't be able to go home for a week.

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm afraid that I won't be able to go home for a week.

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm afraid that I won't be able to go home for a week.

77
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,100
You should be a kind description of a gentleman.

78
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm too lazy to go home.

79
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,100
I'll sleep on the sofa tonight.

80
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Sleep on the sofa?

81
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,900
Okay.

82
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Thank you.

83
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Are you hungry?

84
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Do you want to eat ramen?

85
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Don't bother me.

86
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Why are you standing so far away? Come here.

87
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
What?

88
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Come here.

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,500
Some people say that if the lines of the two's hands and feet can touch each other perfectly,

90
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,900
then it's a deal.

91
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,500
Have a taste of me.

92
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Give me.

93
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Come.

94
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I want to hug you tight

95
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I want to be with you forever

96
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Good night

97
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Good night

98
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Good night

99
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm going to sleep

100
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Good night

101
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm going to sleep

102
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
You sleep

103
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Good night

104
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Good night

105
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Good night
