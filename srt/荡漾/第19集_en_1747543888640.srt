00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Girlfriend

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a slow person.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But I will walk towards you step by step at my own speed.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Slow but fast.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Xu Yan, come here.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Xu Yan, you are not in the right state today.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, director.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay?

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By the way, Xu Yan.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This kiss scene is very important.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Think about it.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I always thought I was indispensable.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But in the eyes of Xing Yan, you are obviously more important than me.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Actually, Xing Yan also approves of you.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's different.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You have influenced Chu Xing Yan.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You have been here all the time.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It will affect her performance.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Slow but fast.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You are not in the right state today.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I didn't think it would be like this.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She needs to work without any rest.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The material of the documentary has been shot enough.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think it should be over.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I see.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You have got enough.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I once thought that one day I could really be the one who stood by Xing Yan and walked with her all her life.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I also thought that if that person was not me, who would it be?

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But even if I thought about it thousands of times,

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't expect that Xing Yan would choose a girl like you.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to deny that you must have a flash of light.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Since she has identified you with something I don't have,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't doubt Xing Yan's vision.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Losing to you, I lost because I was not content.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I gave Xing Yan all my emotions and my youth.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But in the end, what I got was my own life.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Miss Zhu, I am sorry.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't say sorry to me.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are not wrong.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Xing Yan is not wrong either.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Love is love.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Not loving is not loving.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will try my best to bless you.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Zhu Yan.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Xing Yan.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I am going abroad for a while to study abroad.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am going abroad for a while to study abroad.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It has been decided.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You have your dream.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I should also find my own dream.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Staying by your side,

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't control my feelings.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can only start over when I leave.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you don't have to worry.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have already hired an excellent agent to take care of you.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The work is almost done.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He will contact you after work.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I promise that your request for me

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
will be done by the next person.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't have to change to a new agent.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Zhu Yan.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
After I leave,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I must pay attention to the diet.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If it's not good,

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I should eat less cold and spicy food.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Drink less alcohol and drink more warm water.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't always stay up late.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Even if you are studying the script and practicing the lines,

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
don't forget the time when you are focused.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's hard to shoot.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When you are on a diet,

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you should pay attention to the intake of carbohydrates and nutrients.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a must for your body.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Also,

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know that you are doing your best as an actress.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You want to prove yourself.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But sometimes, you are too humble to pursue something.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Instead, you leave a mark.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The most precious thing on you

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
is the strong empathy and feeling.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
When you are filming,

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you should calm down and express your feelings with your heart.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can see that.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will try.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Pay attention to money.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't be emotional.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Money is more important than anything.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It includes your right to choose.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The rainbow is blooming

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The wind is blowing

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No matter where I go,

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I hope you can get better and better.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The fire is burning in the sky

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wish you happiness forever.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You appeared in the vast world

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I am holding on to the light

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are covered in light

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Melt me once

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Break the boundary

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And close the window of the mountain for me

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are covered in light

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Melt me once

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Break the boundary

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And close the window of the mountain for me

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am here.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sister.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Xin Yan, you are not in a good state recently.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, a little.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are a mature artist.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In your profession,

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
no matter your ability or attitude,

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you never let me worry.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I am always worried about you.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am always worried about you.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am always worried about you.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am always worried about you.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am always worried about you.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You have never let me worry about your attitude.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's wrong this time?

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because of some private matters.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It affects my work.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If it's private, I won't ask more.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But the company has to be clear.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A professional actor

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
will release the emotion completely in front of the camera.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Your performance not only represents you,

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but also represents me.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's the first time I've encountered this kind of thing.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You adjust it.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
As an actor, as long as you are in the film field,

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you have to make every emotion and emotion

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
for the shooting.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't need to teach you

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the principle of the scene is bigger than the sky.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I understand.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have a lot to learn.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Adjust your state quickly.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If it's too long,

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
some words will be spread too much.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It will affect your future development.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I know.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Drink some coffee to relieve the swelling.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The first time I came to this city,

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I felt its enthusiasm.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's very suitable for our film theme.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Back to the past and say I love you.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I believe

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
if it can really go back to the past,

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
this city will be full of beautiful memories.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I hope that when the film is released,

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
it can meet everyone's expectations.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You have been here all the time

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
will affect his performance.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The material of the documentary has been shot enough.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think it should be over.

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I want to fashionable image of you.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe we can make it less sandy.

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If you say you like it,

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we'll move to bookyers.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't be that accepting.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want to be excited.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to meet your newloaf.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
買,

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
ok.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm lonely.

178
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Chu Xin Yan.

179
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,760
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

180
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,720
She's here to be lonely with you.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,600
The star in the mirror.

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
At least I want to be alone with you.

183
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,000
The sun behind the moonlight.

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Is the answer in your heart.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,400
A big screen, finally the past.
