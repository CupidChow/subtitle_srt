1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I love you

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In my opinion, a good performance

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
must be unforgettable and touching

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I have played a play

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
where the heroine is dying

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The heroine is writing a poem for the heroine

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The performance is completely immersed

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heroine is crying while writing a poem

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Every time she recalls the play

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
she feels very sad

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then the audience...

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't care about the performance

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a play

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's fake, understand?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She loves to perform

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I shouldn't question her

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Maybe I made a mistake

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Baby

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Baby

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You are on the news

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Chu Xin Yan's studio stole a small assistant

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She hates CP and old-timey B

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's going on?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh my god

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Chu Xin Yan is cheating

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who is Song Ruan?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's really disappointing

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My sister is much prettier than that little three

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is Chu Xin Yan blind?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Chu Xin Yan is really hungry

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's wrong with this?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are Chu Xin Yan's girlfriend, okay?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The situation has developed so much

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What do you think we should do?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can ask the reporters to clarify this right away

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Stop

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your relationship with Guan Xuan and Song Ruan

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is not good for our movie

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How will the audience see you and Hao play the opposite role?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How about this?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I will hold a movie conference

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your relationship with Guan Xuan and Hao

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
will be a big hit in front of everyone

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It will be a big hit

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It will be a publicity for our movie

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Isn't it good?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Impossible, sister

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I said I wouldn't use emotional speculation

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But Song Ruan is my girlfriend

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How can I let her suffer this kind of grievance?

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You want to have a relationship with Song Ruan now

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you sure she can bear it?

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Xin Yan, the movie is about to be finished

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It will be released in half a year

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can just pretend to play a scene with Lin Hao Hao

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You break up with Guan Xuan after a year and a half

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can have a relationship with Song Ruan publicly

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is it not good?

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I really can't act

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But Song Ruan agreed

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who is so short-tempered?

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How can you report her personal information?

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ruan

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I just came back and saw a reporter downstairs

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stay at home these days

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't go out

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here is your package

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sorry to involve you

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will give you a tarot later

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
See how to help you fix your problem

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I will take it

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why did Song Ruan agree to do this?

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
These people are crazy

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are bullying me, right?

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is this?

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you crazy?

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ruan, you have to contact Chu Xin Yan now

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let her be clear

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Xin Yan

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ruan, how are you?

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll come to you right away

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, there are reporters outside

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's wrong with the reporter?

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You are my girlfriend

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't listen to Le Jie and their nonsense

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won't make a good show with Lin Hao Hao

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't be impulsive

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You love to perform so much

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You are so passionate about performing

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You have given so much information for this movie

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't want to destroy everything because of me

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm fine

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm just a nobody

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The netizens will forget me in a few days

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am willing to cooperate with the crew's decision

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You see, I play the role of the opponent of Lin Hao Hao

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so sad

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can you accept us to fight for the CP?

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't care

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Listen to me

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll come to you right away

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't come

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't want to see you now

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't lie to me

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I said I wouldn't let you come

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait for me

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Song Wan

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Miss Song

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Miss Song

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Miss Song

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's your relationship with Chu Xin Yan?

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Song

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Miss Song

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You used to be a fan of the movie

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why did you suddenly become her personal assistant?

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are you really the kind of special relationship that is passed on online?

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Miss Song

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you know the relationship between her and Lin Hao?

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Does Lin Hao know your relationship?

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Chu Xin Yan and I have never been

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Miss Song

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you sure that you are filming a personal film for Chu Xin Yan?

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Does she have other purposes?

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What is the purpose?

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Miss Song

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Miss Song, please respond

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Chu Xin Yan

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Mr. Chu

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mr. Chu

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mr. Chu

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Mr. Chu

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please ask

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What is the relationship between you and Song Wan and Lin Hao?

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mr. Chu, Mr. Chu

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Come and find Song Wan

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Does Lin Hao know?

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lin Hao is my colleague

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Song Wan

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is my girlfriend

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Chu

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mr. Chu

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Does Lin Hao know?

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Does Lin Hao know that you are replying?

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mr. Chu

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Chu

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Please tell us about your relationship

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please respond to us, okay?

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you respond to us properly?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Chu

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mr. Chu

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Mr. Chu

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mr. Chu

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Didn't I tell you not to come?

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,640
This song listen to you

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,220
I think he can't fight this

158
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,180
So very soft

159
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,080
After waiting with you, receding at sea

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,740
With a trace of light that can wipe out the wound

161
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,280
Burr

162
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,700
You don't listen to people

163
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you think you can bequal to love

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,000
You are covered in light

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,200
Like a piece of me

166
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
The secret is like a secret

167
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,200
It's easy to be romantic

168
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,200
You are covered in light

169
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Falling on my heart

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,200
The darkness is coming

171
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,200
It makes me unconscious

172
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,200
You are covered in light

173
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Like a piece of me

174
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
The secret is like a secret

175
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,200
You are covered in light

176
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I hate Song Ruan no matter what

177
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I don't want to do such a thing

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Since it's not from you

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I hope you can clarify

180
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Those things about Song Ruan

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
If you can cooperate

182
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm willing to do anything

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,200
At the moment of going home by train

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Is it happy to be hurt

185
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,200
If I have white hair again

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Let me be alone with you

187
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,200
The night with clouds

188
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,200
At least I can be alone with you

189
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,200
The sun behind the moonlight

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Is the answer in your heart
