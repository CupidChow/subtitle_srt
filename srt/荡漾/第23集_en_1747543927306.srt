00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Girlfriend

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You don't think I sent those photos, right?

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No matter how much I hate Song Ruan,

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I won't be able to do such a lowly thing.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Since it wasn't you who sent it,

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hope you can clarify

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that those things about Song Ruan are not just words.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't want to cooperate. I'm willing to do anything.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Chu Xin Yan, it's been three years.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You haven't answered any of my calls or contacted me for three years.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, you're pleading with me for him.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, I can clarify for him,

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but you must come back to me.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This won't do.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Why do you have to choose an ordinary person instead of me?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're the best match.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I worked so hard to get close to you.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I did it to deserve you.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to be with you, to be with you with all my heart.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't you understand? Love doesn't need a match.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As long as I love her, no matter what her status is,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
she's the best in my heart.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Status?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Status?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, back then,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was wrong.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Wasn't it?

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you still hate me,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
then come at me.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Song Ruan has nothing to do with us.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I won't help him.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You'll regret it.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, Sister.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Chu Xin Yan, why did you confess to the reporters that Song Ruan is your girlfriend?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You've messed up all the arrangements.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Zi Fang has decided to stop all your shoots before the public opinion is settled.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you don't handle this well,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you'll probably be replaced.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Take care.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sister.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hello?

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mom, how did you come in?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The whole hotel is under the house.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How did I come in?

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You should know very well

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
your current situation.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Do you still not want to come back?

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I admit

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that the situation is very difficult.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not the one who can't come back.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The situation is very difficult.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But I won't give up.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I firmly believe that I can stand up again.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Stand up?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you rely on to stand up?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you think you still have a chance to turn around?

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't be the main character, but I can be the supporting role.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If I can't be the supporting role, I can be the group actor.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm still young.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have the opportunity and experience to prove myself.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You were the top before.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now you choose to be the top.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you think this is a fallacy?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is only temporary.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I believe that time will give me a chance to clarify everything.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I won't let down a hardworking person.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Until older, I will not think about our relationship.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Young.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When it's because your reasons are there,

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
whoisz the most?)

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
though it's best not to wirghten your relations?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's fine.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then I will explain to you how to affect precious love.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,040
It's just one thing.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,960
I've made my choice for you.

77
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
If you still want to

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
walk on the path of an actor,

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
you must give up Song Lan.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
If you insist on making a choice for me,

81
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,120
my answer is

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
no.

83
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,640
In this world,

84
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
you don't need to make a choice

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
for everything.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,640
It's possible that

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
it's right to exist.

88
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
You're my mother.

89
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
I'm an actor.

90
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I may

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,160
inherit everything in the family in the future.

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
These are not

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,760
a conflict of insistence.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
It can also be a fusion,

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
a harmony.

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,400
Let's go.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
Is this where you work?

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,280
Why is there no one here?

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,160
Today is Sunday.

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
I don't need to go to work.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Silly.

102
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
That's where I usually

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,360
edit my documentaries.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,000
Stand still.

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
I have something to say.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
I've edited

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,400
all your personal documentaries.

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
Now,

110
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,760
I want to fulfill my promise

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
to invite you to edit.

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,720
Is it necessary to publish it now?

113
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Of course.

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,320
I want everyone

115
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
to see the real you.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,480
The best Chu Xingyan

117
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
in my eyes.

118
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go, Jiafeng.

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,960
Let's see

120
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
what's going on.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,680
They met each other and parented each other.

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,960
So I'm sure

123
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,900
Chu's wedding

124
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,880
can't end Ã¨

125
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,820
without a compromise.

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
We'll stand by each other

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
till we decide on it.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
This is Mr. Ma Xu

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
who recently entered the industry.

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,020
I think

131
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,380
his business development

132
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,360
is on fire.

133
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
I'm going to take a picture of you today.

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,440
It's beautiful.

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
Look at you.

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
So it has to be you.

137
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
It has to be you.

138
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
Come on.

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,280
Let's take a picture.

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,560
When I was young,

141
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,880
there was a wolf dog in our house.

142
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,840
It was about to die.

143
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,480
It was hiding in a corner.

144
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
I said,

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,960
what's wrong with you?

146
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Why are you so down today?

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
I kept pushing it.

148
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,760
I kept thinking that

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,680
it would play with me.

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
It was so cute.

151
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,480
It was still a kid when it played with me.

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,280
But then I felt that

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
I was a bad boy.

154
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,800
I didn't let people die in peace.

155
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,120
It was the first dog in my house.

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,920
I didn't raise any animals later.

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Because I've been raising

158
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,080
animals for many years.

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,240
The feeling of death

160
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,600
is really like a person who died of a family.

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
It feels like that.

162
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
It feels like you're breathing in needed oxygen.

163
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I thought

164
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,760
the one in the pictureThen I realized

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
I'm dead.

166
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Their death is too strange.

167
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
They chemed your eyes.

168
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,240
My life began to grow inside of me...

169
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,740
Welcome Social Social

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,460
Opening...

171
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,000
What is your dream?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Free until the last breath

173
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,960
Come here.

174
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,680
Free...

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,440
In my opinion,

177
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
good performances

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
must make the audience

179
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
feel touched and touched.

180
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,160
Sometimes I wonder

181
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,600
if there is a parallel universe

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
with such a story.

183
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,520
But their stories

184
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,760
are not left with regrets

185
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
by others.

186
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
We just

187
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
performed them.

188
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,760
We made up for their regrets.

189
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
I think

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
it's a very meaningful thing.
