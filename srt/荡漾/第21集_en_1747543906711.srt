3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's start with the pre-recording of the sword dance.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And then, Xing Yan,

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
help me make a play.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Chu Xing Yan,

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
are you ready?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You have to cooperate with me

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
in today's play.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, ready?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come on, start.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A-level seven, three-level two, four.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Cut.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you really want to be with those people?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Money and people,

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which is more important to you?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I have my own difficulties.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Stop.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's going on?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Chu Xing Yan,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this is a big play.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Even if the camera can't capture you,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you have to be serious.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can't be in the play.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Director, do it again.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, Xing Yan,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
give more emotions.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Give more.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's do it again.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, ready?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Start.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are they so important to you?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Money and people,

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which is more important to you?

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have my own difficulties.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Stop.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Your expression is very inaccurate.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't take the play.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Stop.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm here.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You should look at me.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you understand?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't think this is good.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Director, do it again.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jiang Feng,

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I think this is perfect.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's do it again.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come on, next play.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you for your hard work.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Chu Xing Yan.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You're welcome.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Have some water.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This play

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
can only shoot your back.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's so busy.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's so arrogant.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's his turn.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He can't play.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's okay.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm glad you finished shooting.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you tired?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Xing Yan.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Jiang Feng said he was not feeling well.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He came to play for you.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's not feeling well.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He can't play anyway.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Director, what are you doing?

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Come here.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't disturb the camera.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, we're ready to start.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come on, start.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Start.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A-game, start.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Count three times.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ready, start.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you really going to be with them?

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Money and women

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
are more important to you.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I have my own

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have my own

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have my own

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have my own

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have my own

143
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I have my own

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I have my own

145
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
I have my own

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have my own

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have my own

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
My own

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have my own

150
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have my own

151
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
I have my own

152
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Big Angle

153
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,940
Don't see you making them feel so pathetic.

154
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,580
What is to...?

155
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,860
I want to look around with you

156
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,540
and harvest all my romance

157
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Do you want to sounds fromä¹Ÿ?

158
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,260
if I can take you anywhere

159
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,220
Has it come to you?

160
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,100
No, it hasn't been.

161
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,180
What time is it now?

162
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,420
We should have gotten this in time.

163
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Jiang Feng wants me to shoot him

164
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,180
and put my faith at the bottom.

165
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,180
He's the person again.

166
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,300
Doesn't he play well?

167
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm sorry.

168
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,780
Did you

169
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,140
wait for me like this in the studio?

170
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,020
The money was very popular.

171
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,100
But I sold it

172
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,220
and it's gone.

173
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,780
You're popular now.

174
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,540
How about I ask the driver

175
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,860
to send you back first?

176
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,660
I want to accompany you

177
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,540
to help you practice.

178
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,940
I've almost memorized it.

179
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,020
I had a nightmare

180
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,100
in my dream.

181
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,660
What dream?

182
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,140
I dreamed that there was a bad guy who saved me.

183
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,140
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

184
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,060
Hit him.

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,940
I know I didn't do well enough before,

186
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,460
but I really can't lose you.

187
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,860
I'm done with you.

188
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,780
Let go of me.

189
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,300
Did you forget that we

190
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,820
almost had an umbrella in the warehouse?

191
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,340
Did you forget the promise we made

192
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,740
under the wutong tree in the school?

193
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,100
Don't think about leaving me.

194
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,460
If you want to leave,

195
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,940
I'll stand here and wait for you.

196
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,140
From my whole life,

197
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,700
I'll remember our past over and over again.

198
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,300
I'll remember our past over and over again.

199
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,060
But

200
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,860
even if I can get a little bit of

201
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,060
your memory back,

202
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,460
I'm willing to.

203
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Are you stupid?

204
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,260
It's beautiful.

205
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,220
Very good.

206
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,540
Liu Yan Yan, take a break.

207
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,740
Let's prepare for the next part.

208
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,580
Xin Yan, your hair is messy.

209
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,820
It's so sweet.

210
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,060
So good.

211
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
You're so good at it.

212
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,940
Er Ruan.

213
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,620
Er Ruan.

214
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,940
What's wrong?

215
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,020
Lin Hao Hao and I were just acting.

216
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
What's wrong?

217
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,380
I...

218
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,380
I know you're good at acting.

219
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,380
Don't care about the way the camera looks.

220
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,820
That's the need of the character.

221
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,580
It's a performance.

222
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,900
It's fake. Understand?

223
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,580
I'm really standing in front of you.

224
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,620
In my eyes,

225
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,740
you're in my heart.

226
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,220
Don't ask me what happened just now.

227
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,700
But you were

228
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,940
also looking at Lin Hao Hao like this.

229
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,980
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,140
I...

231
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,260
I know I should understand you.

232
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,500
I should believe you.

233
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,700
I thought I was ready to do it.

234
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,020
But...

235
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,420
But I really saw you confessing to a girl.

236
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Kissing.

237
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,580
I...

238
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,300
I can't be like you actors.

239
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,380
Be so rude.

240
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,180
Understand?

241
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Er Ruan.

242
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,100
Let me calm down.

243
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,220
Listen to me.

244
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,740
I want to calm down for a while.

245
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
I should be more happy.

247
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,580
Er Ruan.

248
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,900
The night is so noisy.

249
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,980
At least I'm alone with you.

250
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,980
The sun behind the moonlight

251
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,340
is the answer in your heart.

252
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:45,020
A big bottle of wine and a big bowl of rice.
