00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
People say that true love is undesirable.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But a woman who falls in love

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
always believes that

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
she will be that lucky girl.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll send you off.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Rest early. Good night.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Didn't I tell you not to come to me?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm just a host. It's not good for me.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's be apart for a while.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then...

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That day, we...

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That night, did you also

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
get a beautiful memory?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, that's it.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I lost.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But if a serious person is destined to be defeated,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
can I still believe in love?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Baby, it's been a week.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why are you still crying for that bastard?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm already crying for myself.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How can I be so stupid?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How are you stupid?

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The stupid one is the man

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
who doesn't believe in love.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A high-quality party.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here, all the best

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
handsome and beautiful women

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
in this city are gathered.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How childish?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not childish.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are also all kinds of snacks. All for free.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Free?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Free, free.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Luan, no matter how happy you are later,

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you have to remember

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to keep yourself in and out.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't wander around in a happy and carefree way.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you understand?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How about I go back?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Look, you're making me look like I don't even exist.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So awkward.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're here, let's go.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ran Ran, I'm going to meet my friend.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You have to remember what I said.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then I...

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You have fun first.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Dessert, is it good?

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's good.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why don't you go to my room later?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have better food there.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No need.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm just a little hungry.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm just thinking

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
of protecting you.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you doing?

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So ridiculous.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This person is so weird.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why are you following me?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sorry.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There's a masked man chasing me.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let go.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is my room.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Get out.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You...

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You look like a ghost.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why are you so stubborn?

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're acting so real.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What real?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How do you want me to save you?

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm not going to tell you.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm just going to tell you.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm just going to tell you.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm just going to tell you.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How do you want me to save you?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like this?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to get out now.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please move.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You want to leave just because you just came?

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't you like acting?

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then I'll play with you until the end.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you doing?

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Give it back to me.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't do it again.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're acting so real.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not fun to be a little white flower.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't make fun of me.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're a rogue.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You don't know me?

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why should I know you?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let go of me.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're a pervert.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry, baby.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I scared you.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Look.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I bought you your favorite beef.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And your favorite crab sticks.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry, okay?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're all talented.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're like a horse that hasn't been released.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're right. We're not going there anymore.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you buy the shrimp paste?

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Of course I bought it.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Put it down.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're a little conscience.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's eat.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, no.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was late for a few days of internship.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Will I be fired?

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Director Cui, your home-cooked food.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Song Nuan.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wait for me there.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A little artiste.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you making a personal movie?

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You said you were going to change resources and gain benefits.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're just trying to make a fool of yourself.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're so useless.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Director.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was late this morning because of the road...

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Xiaosong.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you like to blow the stars?

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Chu Xin Yan, do you know?

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now, there are a lot of famous singers.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There are 5 million fans.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Our magazine is going to make a personal documentary with her.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How many people want to see it?

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm making a documentary?

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But I just had an internship for a week.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Xiaosong.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When this is done,

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I promise you to transfer.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you, director.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will try my best to complete it.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't expect to have such a good opportunity after the internship.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yuan's Roadside House is ruined.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's endless, right?

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When are you going to stop bothering me?

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who's bothering you?

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm here for work.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Say it. What do you want?

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Signature?

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't be so self-willed.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm not here to find you today.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm looking for Chu Xin Yan.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is there a possibility that I am Chu Xin Yan?

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are Chu Xin Yan?

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've seen a lot of fans.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've never seen anyone like this before.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you have any tricks, use it.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll play with you today.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Little mud ball.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Song Ruan.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This craft is very real.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mr. Chu should know that we are a sample magazine.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Miss Song, compared to your female magazine,

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have a deeper impression of you.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mr. Chu, let me tell you the truth.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
At this stage, I'm in the middle of a feast for men.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All men are the same in my eyes.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just like cabbage.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's get to know each other again.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You are so passionate.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What do you mainly do in your magazine?

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Producer and director.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Producer and director.

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Big director, big producer.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Looking forward to seeing your work with 9.0 points.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hello, Chu Xin Yan.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You are a sample magazine?

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How do you get me a record?

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, I know.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mr. Chu, do you believe me?

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
How do you want to shoot?

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
To shoot a male artist,

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you have to use the perspective of a female fan.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My strategy is

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to turn my lens into a female fan

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to show you the real side.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You are the best.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
To show you the real side.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Aren't you a man?

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How do you turn into a female fan?

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I am very company-oriented.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
As long as I get to work,

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I promise to shoot you clearly.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Clearly?

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
To what extent?

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Including my privacy?

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What privacy?

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well,

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Congress.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Congress is...

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's for later.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:33,740
You don't need the

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But as a partner, I have a condition too.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Tell me.

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I want your exclusive...

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're quite strong.

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why should I agree to it?

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When we shoot, everything will be under your command.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll be your producer.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Isn't that what's supposed to be?

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now that you're talking to me about these conditions,

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
is this your first time working with an artist?

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Little muddler.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
An intern?

214
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Forget it.

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not that I can't agree to it.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't bring an assistant this time.

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
When we shoot, you have to be my assistant.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can call me whatever you want.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I...

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Forget it if you can't do it.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, I'll try my best.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
These autographs...

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
For you?

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No need.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll analyze how to shoot every day on the bed.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I hope that through Director Song's shooting this time,

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can show people a different side of me.

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sure of it.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Liking me...

230
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
isn't something to be ashamed of.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The sun is the answer in your heart.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A big ice finally melts.
