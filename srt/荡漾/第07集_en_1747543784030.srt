00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's going on with the photos on the Internet?

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They're fake.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If these videos are spread out,

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
do you know how much it will affect our Chu family?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're ruining the reputation of the Chu family.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If your father were still alive,

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
how would he look at you?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If my father were still alive,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
he would definitely believe me.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're saying I don't trust you, right?

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All these years, you've been using the name of acting

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to change your name to a Japanese name.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're using the name of acting to change your name.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You think I don't know?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You have no trust in me anymore.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The Chu family can delete your news on the Internet.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You must follow my arrangement.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Come back and join the company with me.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't need to. I have my own arrangement.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Being an actor is my dream. Don't change your name.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I entered my new apartment,

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so I couldn't leave my old house

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and enter the place where my father lived or missed.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But right before him I opened my door.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I still didn't â€¦

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There was nothing.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Did you find my room?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The room that the plays had been playing for the past five years.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's been rather a life force then.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't think so.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,800
What's the matter?

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,160
You...

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,240
You're okay!

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,420
Bye!

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,020
What are you really afraid of

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,900
Are you okay

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,660
Does it still hurt

40
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
I'm not.

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,140
Compared to being hurt,

42
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,500
isn't it more embarrassing to be seen by you?

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,220
What's there to be embarrassed about?

44
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,860
When I was little,

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,820
my dad used to chase me with his blood.

46
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,340
In this world,

47
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,500
everyone wants to change others.

48
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,180
Not to mention the strong parents.

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,340
They just hope

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,940
their children can do whatever they want.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,860
What do you mean?

52
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,620
Which side are you on?

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,540
I'm on your mother's side.

54
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,020
After all,

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,180
I also have my own child to take care of.

56
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,740
You still say...

57
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,180
But I'm also on your side.

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
I'm on someone's side

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,900
because

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,420
he's determined to do what he likes.

61
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,820
There's a saying,

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,940
my life has a firmness that I can't control.

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,620
You are you.

64
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,620
You don't need to be recognized by everyone.

65
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
As long as you have a clear conscience,

66
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
no one can stop you.

67
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
You are you.

68
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
You're really good at making documentaries.

69
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,940
You're good at everything.

70
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,700
No one can replace you.

72
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,620
With you by my side.

73
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,100
On the way we each go,

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,020
there will be a lot of obstacles.

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,500
Whether you can go on your way

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,300
depends on how determined you are

77
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
and how brave you are.

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,300
Thank you, Niannian.

79
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
You're welcome.

80
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Time changes,

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,500
through your eyes.

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
But your dad is really cruel.

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
With me,

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
don't think about

85
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,900
the deep and difficult feelings.

86
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,100
Here,

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,500
there's only me and you.

88
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Miss Song.

89
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,900
Where's your camera?

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Chu Xingyan isn't in a good condition today,

91
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,500
so I didn't film.

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,900
Since you're not filming,

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,300
why are you still here?

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,300
I just want to be a friend today

95
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,300
to accompany her.

96
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,900
Accompany her?

97
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Miss Song, you're too kind.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,700
Xingyan doesn't need friends.

99
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
After so many years,

100
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
only an agent like me

101
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
has the right to accompany her.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,900
You like her?

103
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

104
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm good to Xingyan

105
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,900
because of my job

106
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,700
and my appreciation for her talent.

107
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,500
But then,

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,700
don't you still admit

109
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,100
that you have feelings for her?

110
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,300
What do you know?

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,700
We're comrades.

112
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,900
After so many years,

113
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,500
her career is my career,

114
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,300
and her business is mine.

115
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,500
I won't let anyone

116
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,900
affect her future.

117
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,100
So Miss Song,

118
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm not going to let you

119
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
bring unnecessary rumors to Xingyan.

120
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Hello?

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Hello?

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Hello?

123
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Hello?

124
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Hello?

125
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Hello?

126
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Song Ruan,

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
let's go out for dinner tonight.

128
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
Why?

129
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,700
You're so good at comforting people.

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,500
I have to treat you to something good.

131
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
No need.

132
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
I'm going to eat instant noodles.

133
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,700
What instant noodles?

134
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,100
Are you coming or not?

135
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,900
If you're not coming, I'll go find you.

136
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Don't come.

137
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Then send me the location.

138
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Okay.

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
I'm going out now.

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
I'll never listen to anyone.

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Zhu Yan,

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,100
I remember now.

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
In that 4MV,

144
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
I shot two scenes in my suite.

145
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,100
The next day,

146
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,900
the two female models in that MV

147
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
knocked on my door

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,300
and get the surveillance footage of the hotel,

149
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,340
it can prove that

150
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,060
they are really looking for cosmetics.

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,020
Okay.

152
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,500
I've ordered.

153
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,820
Why don't you order?

154
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,820
You are being framed and blackmailed

155
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,340
and said you are the King of the Sea.

156
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,940
You are the King of the Sea.

157
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,980
The night with clouds and foxes,

158
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,180
at least I'm alone with you.

159
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,300
The sun behind the moonlight,

160
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,620
is the answer in your heart.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,240
The science collection series of

162
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,140
Yun memory season 1,

163
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:58,900
has a
