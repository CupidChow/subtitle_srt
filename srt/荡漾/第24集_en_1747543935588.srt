Episode 16

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello, everyone. I'm actor Lin Hao Hao.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm recording this video today to talk about Chu Xin Yan and I.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We indeed had a relationship.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's start from college.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We were together for a year, two years, three years.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, we were together for three years.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But we ended up breaking up peacefully.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
After college, we never contacted each other again.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Until now, we were just colleagues.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Later, when we were working together,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I saw Chu Xin Yan and Song Ruan's sweet love story.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was truly happy for her.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They truly loved each other. They never let me down.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think that in this incredibly realistic world,

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
being able to stick to love and believe in love is a very precious thing.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will bless them.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I also hope that everyone can respect and understand them.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jian Yu, I'm not the one who caused the scandal. Why did you drive me out of the crew?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All the people in the crew already know that it was you

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
who secretly took photos of Chu Xin Yan and Song Ruan for the reporters.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In order to get a role, you really did a lot of things.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You made my crew look so dirty.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sister, let me explain to you.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can accept an actor, right?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I can't accept that he's not a good person.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will take all your scenes.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Also, there is no possibility for us to work together again.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sister Luo!

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, right. The two models have already submitted their cases.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You will be facing a criminal case.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,640
Xia roasting

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,120
Just close the window of your heart for me

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,840
You are covered in light

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,960
Like a piece of me

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,960
The secret is like a secret

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,960
It's enough to be romantic

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,960
You are covered in light

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Falling on my heart

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
The darkness is out

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,960
And make me unconscious

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,960
You are covered in light

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Like a piece of me

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Loving and hugging each other

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Is enough to be romantic

47
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I will give you a kiss

48
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,960
You are covered in light

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Like a piece of me

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Loving and hugging each other

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Is enough to be romantic

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
You are covered in light

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Like a piece of me

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Loving and hugging each other

55
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Is enough to be romantic

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I am covered in light

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Like a piece of me

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Loving and hugging each other

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Is enough to be romantic

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
You're going to work hard.

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,000
You must have reached the letter.

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,880
Didn't you put this children's section among them?

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
Then maybe...

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
Your daughter can read.

65
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,640
I did.

66
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,560
But I can't do anything

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
It's like a movie.

68
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Can you marry me?

69
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
Stick going and eat both of you

70
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,920
Ten-cheers

71
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,840
Only one thing I wish to say baby, it is you

72
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,320
Promise me one small thing, you will be my Christmas

73
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,160
At the corner of the city, I'm waiting for the moment to go home

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,840
Is it happiness?

75
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,440
Or sadness?

76
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,240
If I'm carrying white hair in the car

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,240
Let me be alone with you

78
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,880
The night with the clouds

79
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,000
At least I'll be alone with you

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,960
The sun behind the moonlight

81
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,200
Is the answer in your heart

82
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,080
A promise is finally made
