00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My Girlfriend

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,200
Sometimes, he's passionate. Sometimes, he's cold.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,800
But it was obviously him who was the one who took the initiative.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,400
His eyes, his words, they all made people blush.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
What exactly did he think?

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,400
But why did he act like a different person when I was about to start a relationship?

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,800
How come you are so upset because of a man?

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
This man is like a kite. He's in your hands.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,000
The key is that you have to learn how to let go of yourself.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
I want to, but I can't see his pulse.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Is his feelings for you really important?

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,800
The important thing is that you have to figure out if you like him or not.

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I do like him, but...

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
why do I feel like he rejected me?

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
How can you say that first?

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,400
This man is like a cat. The more you chase him, the more he runs.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,400
If you don't chase him, he'll get curious and come over.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
What should I do then?

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I'll have to wait for him to come back.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,600
You've picked him up. Stop contacting him.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me tell you, if he's cold, you'll be even colder.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,200
If he wants to contact you, you shouldn't mind him.

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Who hasn't had a little temper yet?

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,600
How dare you come to such a flat place with me?

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Aren't you afraid that I'll use some evil intentions and kidnap you?

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
If it's you, then I'll kidnap you.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe...

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm the one who's going to get caught.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,600
I can sit here.

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
That means I'm willing.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
I like you.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
I like you.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Should we be together?

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:41,800
standing

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Chu Xin Yan,

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,800
just what is going on with you?

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
You're too fierce.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
Xing Yan.

40
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Have you done

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
your job?

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,680
Am I being too ungrateful?

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Chu Xing Yan.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Come out and have some coffee.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,640
Why are you drinking coffee in the middle of the night?

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
Aren't you afraid of being heartbroken?

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Chu Xing Yan.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
Have you

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
fallen asleep?

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
No call?

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
No.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,240
Are you done yet?

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
You're not done yet?

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,800
Senior, are you meeting someone in friendly 2009?

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,320
No!

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,400
We'll meet at the company,

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
why can't

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
meet for free?

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,040
I think

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
no.]

61
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,540
Songran

62
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,260
You are out of battery

63
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I want to have a look

64
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
But everything you see here has battery

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
Pei Tong, you stopped here.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,920
It should be a short cut.

67
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,400
I don't know.

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,840
I've talked to the hotel.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,600
They can call the electrician.

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,920
Why?

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,080
The one who is in the city is here.

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
These electrician problems

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,520
are just a small problem for me.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,920
I'll solve all the problems in our house.

75
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
Okay, I'll just put this on.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,960
What's wrong?

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,840
It should be a short cut.

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
Let me check it again.

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Come on.

80
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Coming.

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,480
Ini?

82
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,120
The leg.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
How flat it is.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,000
Look.

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,240
You wouldn't bend over with these earthquake motion practices.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
Here.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,560
How long has it been?

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,360
Abruptly.

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,240
Uncle, why don't you try to read through,

90
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,160
This seems bad.

91
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
gods

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,700
my

93
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,780
cake

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,720
You have the cake.

95
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,900
You should come again.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
We can have this cake over united phones.

97
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,260
You see.

98
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,440
What if all our friends

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,500
come to our house at the same time?

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,240
Come instead.

101
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,160
You're so naughty.

102
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,360
You really torment me.

103
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,980
You PVP punk!

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,380
Lin Yan, what are you afraid of?

105
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,500
I don't know.

106
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,820
Maybe I don't want to really...

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,420
fall in love.

108
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,500
I don't know myself well.

109
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,220
When you persuaded me,

110
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,060
I remembered everything.

111
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,340
You didn't say that.

112
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
Why am I standing in front of you now?

113
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,260
You told me that you don't know yourself well.

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,540
You don't even want to

115
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,940
fall in love with me?

116
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,540
It's not about hard work.

117
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,780
Like today, the power was cut off.

118
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,060
You tried hard to fix the circuit.

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,220
So what?

120
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
We're in the dark now.

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,020
Can you say that you didn't work hard?

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,500
If I say that

123
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,740
I can make all the lights in this room

124
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,820
shine.

125
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,380
Why?

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,940
Maybe for our parents.

127
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,340
It's right.

128
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,580
My parents are nice.

129
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,660
We are always loyal to st cookie.

130
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,540
How could this be?

131
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,580
I just got too excited and jumped.

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,620
Then why didn't you turn on the light?

133
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,540
I just want you to feel the darkness for a while.

134
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,820
Zhu Xun Yan.

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,980
I want to tell you that there is a difficulty.

136
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,740
You thought you would climb mountains and climb mountains.

137
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,340
You thought you would go to the mountains and sleep.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,060
But in fact, it was that moment.

139
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,220
I also understood one thing in this moment.

140
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,820
You made me fall in love with you.

141
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,500
You made me have the courage to open the door to you.

142
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,780
I chose to walk towards you.

143
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,100
After falling in love with you,

144
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,660
I took a step forward.

145
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,660
What about you?

146
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,620
Why are you not as good as me?

147
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,060
Zhu Xun Yan.

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,700
You are not as good as me.

149
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,500
Let's face this matter face to face.

150
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,060
Okay?

151
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,340
Forget it, I don't take your advice.

152
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,180
Forget it, I didn't tell you.

153
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,180
I'm here alone

154
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:25,180
The night with the clouds and foxes

155
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,180
At least I'm alone with you

156
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,180
The sun behind the moonlight

157
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Is the answer in your heart

158
00:11:46,180 --> 00:12:00,180
A big ice-cold
