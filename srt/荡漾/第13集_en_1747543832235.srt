My Girlfriend is an Alien

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The movie is about to start.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How could there be such a scandal?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mr. Le, the video was edited by a bad person.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Xing Yan was really framed.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Le Jie, we've known each other for so many years.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You should know that I've never done anything

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that would hurt my conscience and my professional ethics.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This time, someone is really behind this.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a businessman.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't care if this video is real or not.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I care about the return on investment.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
To me, you're a very high-quality product.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If one day you lose your job,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
whether I take the initiative or not,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the world will ask me to abandon you.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, all the investors are so optimistic.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They are deliberately delaying the progress of the project.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will pause the movie for a while.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mr. Le, I know this is a difficult situation.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We are willing to lower the price

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and try to buy some time.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't worry about the real price in this industry.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As long as the PR is in place, the public will forget about it.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
At worst, we will go abroad to develop.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't worry.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How about I go drink with you?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I remember you always ask me to go to the same place

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
whenever you're in a bad mood.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to be alone today.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why are you here?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to be closer to you.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How long have you been here?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I want to be with you.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to be with you.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to be with you.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to be with you.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to be with you.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to be with you.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hello.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't blame yourself for the moment of difficulty.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Don't punish yourself.

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,040
You also think it's my fault?

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Yes.

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,960
Your fault is that you shouldn't have

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
appeared outside my door

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,240
and used my long chair.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
If you do this again,

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll be fired.

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
I should have said more

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
to people like you.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
I can make a big profit.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,720
You're not doing business,

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,680
you're so greedy.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm not greedy.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Business is really greedy.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,120
And...

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
Your fault is that last night

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
you said so many strange things.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
You made me think about it all night.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,240
You didn't answer my call today.

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,000
You didn't reply to my messages.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,320
You're really unreasonable and unpredictable.

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
What's going on with the video?

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
Those two female models

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,760
really went to my room

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,040
to find cosmetics.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
The second half of the video

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
was edited by someone maliciously.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,360
I believe you.

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,680
Why?

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
Didn't you...

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,080
Because

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
during the shooting,

78
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,480
I saw you in person

79
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
in the video.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
You're hardworking,

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
hardworking,

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,480
and hardworking.

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
I want to tell everyone

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
about your shining point.

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,680
If you don't tell me,

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
I'll be the one who's going to be the one

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,280
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
who's going to be the one who's going to be the one

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
who's going to be the one

90
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
and I'll tell you in person.

91
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,240
But if I can't

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
clarify this matter

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,040
and I become

94
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
everything after I fall into the water,

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
will you still stand by my side?

96
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
If I have the same problem

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
as you do now,

98
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
and only you know the truth,

99
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
will you still stand by my side?

100
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,080
If I can sit here,

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
it means I'm willing.

102
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
If I can sit here,

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,840
it means

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm willing, too.

105
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,000
How do you charge the chair?

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
I'll pay for it.

107
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
This is not my home.

108
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,160
My home is in the suburbs.

109
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,160
It's far away and there are few people.

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
It's good that there are few people.

111
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,080
It's just right now.

112
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,040
You can sit here.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
But if you live in my home,

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
my dad will have to pay for it.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
Then write something to pay for your...

116
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,320
Which one else can it be?

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,360
Nothing.

118
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,040
Are you sure you want to go to my home?

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
Go and have a look.

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Here.

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,520
Drink some water.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,280
Thank you.

123
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Come on.

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,160
Yuan,

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,200
your new boyfriend

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
didn't tell you about it?

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
This young man

128
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
is really handsome.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
But why is he so familiar?

130
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
He looks like a celebrity.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,200
What's his name?

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,280
No, no, no.

133
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,840
Mom,

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Mom,

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
a ugly man is a strange man.

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,760
He looks like a handsome man.

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
He looks like a celebrity.

142
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,040
It's normal, right?

143
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,200
How old are you?

144
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm 26 years old.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm a Shuhu.

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
Shuhu people are all like this.

147
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
They don't get along well.

148
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Get along well?

149
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,560
Get along well?

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
How long have you known my daughter?

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
It's...

152
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
Two months.

153
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
Have you ever been friends?

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Yes.

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
What's your

156
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,120
daughter's gender?

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,680
Dad.

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
It's hard to say.

159
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Do you like drinking?

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Occasionally,

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
I have a hard time.

162
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,320
Have you ever drunk with her?

163
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,280
Dad.

164
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Have you?

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
I've had a little drink.

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
A little drink?

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
Do you have any idea?

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,000
No.

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,800
I don't have any idea.

170
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
You're not honest.

171
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
Since you like my daughter,

172
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
you have no idea.

173
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,320
How is that possible?

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
Dad, what do you think?

175
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Are you two colleagues?

176
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,840
Kind of.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
How much do you earn a month?

178
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Quite a lot.

179
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
More than 30,000 yuan.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Not really.

181
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
It seems to be a high income.

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
What's so hard to collect?

183
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
5 million.

184
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,960
How much?

185
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
One month?

186
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,160
You're a big worker.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,440
5 million a month?

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
Sometimes,

189
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
you must...

190
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,560
It's a probably not good business or something.

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,440
As a businessman,

192
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,560
you have to be sharp.

193
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,480
Even if I had one month,

194
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
the business profit must be very good.

195
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Do you think your strategy would be 없ut?

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
How can it be possible?

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,800
I've invested in the course of career,

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
so this time I...

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,080
I won't talk to you for something wrong.

200
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,840
You did suffer.

201
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
Show some gratitude.

202
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,000
I told you not to come.

204
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
You have to come.

205
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
Your dad is a tiger.

206
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
It's hard to get along with him.

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,120
You see it?

208
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,400
Eat watermelon.

209
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,160
Is it good?

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,600
I planted it myself.

211
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
What do you think?

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,760
Sweet.

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,240
You are the joy of my life.

214
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,200
The high-ranking star

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,040
actually appeared in my little yard.

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm going to sleep in my guest room tonight.

217
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,600
Stay here with me to eat watermelon.

218
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,640
It's so strange.

219
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
You're exaggerating.

220
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,800
We are all just ordinary people.

221
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
Then you are an ordinary person.

222
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,040
How dare you come to such a peaceful place with me?

223
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,400
Aren't you afraid that I will tie you up

224
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
with some evil thoughts?

225
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,280
If it's you, then tie me up.

226
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,480
Maybe I'm the one who's going to make a profit.

227
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,400
I want to run away with you

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
and collect all the romance.

229
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm willing to go anywhere with you

230
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
and spend time with you.

231
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:54,360
I want you in every dream.

232
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,680
Chu Xinya.

233
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,040
I hope you are the joy of my life.

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
Eat watermelon.

235
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
It's cold in the night.

236
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,360
I want to hold you tight.

237
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,920
I will be with you for the rest of my life.

238
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:34,520
I want to hug you tightly.

239
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,800
I like you.

240
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,880
I will be with you for the rest of my life.

241
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm trying to find the time to go home.

242
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Is it happiness?

243
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
Or sadness?

244
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,400
If I'm missing you with white hair again,

245
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,720
let me be with you.

246
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,520
The night is so boring.

247
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,680
At least I'm alone with you.

248
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,680
The sun behind the moonlight

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,120
is the answer in your heart.

250
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,800
It brings us happiness.
