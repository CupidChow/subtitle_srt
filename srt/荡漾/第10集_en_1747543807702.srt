Episode 16

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Song Ruan, I'm an actress.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's not easy for me to like you.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Song Ruan, you're not the kind of girl

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
who can be easily deceived by sweet words.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You're the only one in my life.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If I need to use the whole world to exchange you,

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm willing to do it.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's dark.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Song Ruan, wake up.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who are you talking to?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm thinking about our shooting today.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you okay?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You were so drunk yesterday.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You actually...

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I drank the whole bottle.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't remember what happened after that.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You want to deny it?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I really don't remember.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then why are you still telling me...

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Stop talking.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's discuss the shooting content.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm scared.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have a feeling...

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
that there is something wrong.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why are you so nervous?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're blushing.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You still remember the last night, right?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I...

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't remember.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,240
Want to marry me?

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,120
Will you marry me?

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,220

I'll ju feel happy for you.

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,060
I can apply it or urgently do it.

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
If you're sick,

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
I can give you more time.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,880
If you don't decide now,

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,640
I can leave now.

46
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,600
Put it all inside.

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Chu Xin Yan, stop your hunting game.

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't want to be your prey.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,120
What game? What are you talking about?

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,720
Isn't it?

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,920
Once you get it easily,

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
you won't cherish it anymore.

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm just a passerby.

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I can't afford to be your prey.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,720
I just want to live a quiet life.

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,920
You clearly are in love.

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Then tell me,

58
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,320
what do you like about me?

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm lonely with you.

60
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,720
I want to look at you with a smile.

61
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,520
Every time I see you off,

62
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
I'll be sending you off to your house.

63
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,320
I feel that I haven't done enough in some places.

64
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,720
I don't know how to love you.

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I thought that our current interactions

66
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
would have a huge effect.

67
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's separate for a while.

68
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Then, what do we do on that day?

69
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
That night, you also gained

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,720
a wonderful memory, didn't you?

71
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay, let's just do it.

72
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
You clearly are in love with me.

73
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,920
You clearly are in love with me.

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Then tell me, what do you like about me?

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,920
If you're not ready yet,

76
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,320
I can give you some more time.

77
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

82
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

84
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

86
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I'm an actress. It's not easy to act if I like you.

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,920
The sun behind the moonlight

88
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Is in your heart

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
You...

90
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,320
What are you doing?

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm going to take a shower. I thought you left.

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,520
I haven't finished my work yet. Why should I leave?

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,320
I just went out and made a call.

94
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,920
A call?

95
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Isn't the call over there?

96
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm going to take a shower. I'll be back in a minute.

97
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,920
Okay.

98
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm going to take a shower. I'll be back in a minute.

99
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
Okay.

100
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Why did he leave?

101
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
He did it on purpose, right?

102
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,320
When this lake is re-created,

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
is that person you?

104
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
The lake is re-created.

105
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Why don't I take a shower first?

106
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,120
The water has already turned impossible.

107
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,120
I can't leave when it is almost a day.

108
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,320
I didn't see anything like that.

109
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,920
It just seemed like something happened morning.

110
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,520
There is tremendous world rét governed by a lake.

111
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,320
If there were no lake,

112
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,920
the lives of people with the lake will be destroyed.

113
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm dying, I always keep

114
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,320
empty in my heart

115
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,400
It feels like the sun is rising

116
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,680
So my down head finally pick up

117
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
You so low it lingers so at my feet

118
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,080
I

119
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
What are you doing?

120
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm a director

121
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
You are going to shoot a documentary, right?

122
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,160
Then please feel the real me first

123
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,160
Please don't let me down

124
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,080
Please don't let me go

125
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm so scared

126
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,800
Today

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
What are you doing?

128
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm going to take out

129
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,960
Outer follicles

130
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,640
Because I don't have a portfolio

131
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,560
But

132
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,560
I want toism

133
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,040
I want to go back home to get my clothes

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll leave

135
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,000
