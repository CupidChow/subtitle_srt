00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not embarrassing

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to like me.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I really have no idea about you.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a bottle.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Compared to your magazine,

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have a deeper impression of you.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I have no idea about you.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Listen to me.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Song Ruan,

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
all men are beasts.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can't be a fish in the ocean.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your mission now

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is to make a good documentary,

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to raise your mind

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and to change your life.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please look again.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
the highest level of loyalty.

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
It's worth millions of dollars.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,560
It's only two hours a week.

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,080
No one can get it.

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,800
I don't understand

24
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,240
what you're thinking about.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Why are we here in this city?

26
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
It's for Le Tie's movie.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,520
Now that he's here,

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
and he suddenly changed his mind,

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,400
the movie industry is in chaos.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
He hasn't made up his mind.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,440
He's low on money.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,200
Xing Yan,

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
I can be the bad guy.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
When we're in the limelight,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
we should change our mind as soon as possible.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Not everyone has this chance.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,360
I learned acting when I was in school.

38
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,160
My dream is to be a real actor,

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,760
not a pop star.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,680
I have to change my mind this year.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,680
What can you do if you're less successful?

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,520
The market is looking up to you.

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,600
What's wrong with being a pop star?

44
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,200
You're running after the capital.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
You're a path of the poor.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
The more you walk, the narrower you get.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,720
It's better to take a step than to climb a mountain.

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
What if you can't act well?

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,240
To be honest,

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
you don't look up to me.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
I didn't say that.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
I just think it's hard.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
The cost is lower.

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,520
You have to act for three months.

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,560
You can't ask for leave if the cost is low.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
It will affect your exposure rate.

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
And the movie production is under pressure.

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,160
If you can't get a good score,

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
it will affect your reputation.

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,320
I told you.

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
I don't care.

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Do you know why I want to help you

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
to make a documentary?

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,680
It's because you're not on the top of the list.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,080
I got the news that

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,360
someone bought your video.

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
Do you think it's scary?

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
What video?

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
Don't you know if I'm on the top of the list?

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,480
I'm trying to help you.

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,480
Then go ahead.

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm not going to do that.

73
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,240
I'm going to help you.

74
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
I'm going to help you.

75
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,040
I'm going to help you.

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm going to help you.

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm going to help you.

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,120
I'm going to help you.

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
He has a soft-hearted face.

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Tell me what you want to say right away.

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,840
Tell me.

82
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Is it a trouble zone?

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Yes.

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
so want that person.

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,720
The very delivery that will keep me alive

86
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
and kill myoremia

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,880
still need to attend the surgery.

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,160
I tried to be a bad person.

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I tried to be a good person.

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
And I...

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Sister, do you know how much a signature can sell?

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
How much?

93
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,720
50.

94
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,520
500!

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
You can only make a small profit with just a signature.

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
You can sell that much?

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
But he is a person who is self-conceited and likes to release power.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,120
He's like a generator. His heart is smaller than a needle.

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,920
If he finds out that I'm selling his photos, I'll be in trouble.

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
You're right.

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,920
Chu Xin Yan is indeed not a good mouthpiece in the circle.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,520
I recently heard that he was talking with a female singer about a hotel or something about lyrics.

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,920
But he never released their love songs.

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Do you know what his nickname is?

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
What?

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Ding Hai Shen Zhen.

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
What does that mean?

108
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Stop talking.

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Think about it. If you're able to get along with him,

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,320
how many tarot cards can you get from us?

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
They're all top-notch.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,920
If there are too many clients, will the money be wasted?

113
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,120
Will Mr. Bao want to eat the rice?

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
Will he want to order the pork ribs rice cake?

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Sister, it's hard to get money.

116
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,120
But he is...

117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
But he's stronger than your beast.

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,920
You're still talking?

119
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Let's go shoot.

120
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Do you have any opinions about this shooting plan?

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,520
Do you know why I'm going to help you talk about the recorded footage?

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,520
It's all because you're being told that you're not saving money.

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,920
I received news that you bought some unethical video.

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,120
Do you think it's scary?

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,320
You arrange the schedule. I'll try to cooperate.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
And about the assistant...

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I can't be the full-time assistant.

128
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Since you can't be the assistant,

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,920
then your phone will be on for 24 hours.

130
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,720
No matter when I call you, you can't turn it off.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Why is the control so strong?

132
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
You're not as strong as your comrades.

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,720
You're the only one.

134
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay, no problem.

135
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
You have to promise me that you'll give me three hours of shooting time every day.

136
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,720
The message will be back in a second. It can't be more than two minutes.

137
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,320
I can't promise that. What if I have...

138
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Okay, I'll try.

139
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,920
But we have to keep a certain social distance.

140
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,520
Pay attention to our behavior.

141
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Who caught me earlier?

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,320
What's the social distance?

143
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,720
For example, the distance between us now, we can't be close.

144
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
If you get caught by bad people again,

145
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,920
you'll be giving me a head-on hug.

146
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
It's all an accident.

147
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,720
I won't believe it.

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Because I don't believe in love.

149
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Why?

150
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,920
Because men are the same.

151
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Once you get it, you'll be a beast.

152
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,520
That night, did you also get a very good memory?

153
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay, let's just leave it at that.

154
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Don't worry. I don't believe in love either.

155
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,240
Then have a drink with me.

156
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,840
This Chu Xingyan really has some old age.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,720
He even got me to film him. He's not even afraid that he'll get your image collapsed.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
But I can only film your back.

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,640
Whatever.

160
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,000
Just make her face bigger.

161
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,120
Who is that?

162
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,480
Mr. Song is a famous documentary director.

163
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
He's filming a documentary for me.

164
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Come closer.

165
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,720
Come on.

166
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,160
Push.

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,760
I told you to talk about work.

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,680
Mom.

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Cooperation is my job.

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm the real one.

171
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Right, Mr. Song?

172
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,760
Mom.

173
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't mind the camera.

174
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,880
Just say what you want.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Say it.

176
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
You know what I want to say.

177
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,760
I've been training you since you were a kid.

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,440
I've spent so much effort and energy on you.

179
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,880
I hope you can inherit the family business.

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
I don't want you to be a film director.

181
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,760
How long will you take to get back to the company?

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
What do you mean?

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
Is my job not serious?

184
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,200
Or is Mr. Song not serious?

185
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
Don't you think he's serious?

186
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
Even if you don't respect my choice,

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,400
you should respect Mr. Song.

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
Can I be a foodie if I respect him?

189
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
Can I make the family business go up a level?

190
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Why not?

191
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
I'm not joking.

192
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,440
You've been an actor for so many years.

193
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Are you the best actor or the best newcomer?

194
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Has the industry approved you?

195
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
Are you running for director?

196
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Are you running my business?

197
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,680
Will I get the award?

198
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,880
This isn't going to work.

199
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,560
I've made it all ready.

200
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,400
You can handle it.

201
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Stop it.

202
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Did you take it?

203
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes.

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
I'll keep it.

205
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,000
I won't let my family down.

206
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
I'll stick to it.

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,640
The material is quite good.

208
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,840
What's this?

209
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
What are you doing?

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm just trying to take a picture.

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
To see how professional you are.

212
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,760
Don't take my card.

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Gu Xinyan.

214
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,920
I'll take it.

215
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,720
You can't take it.

216
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,760
You asked me to take it.

217
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
You can't play tricks on me because I'm good-tempered.

218
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,080
Today, I'm going to take this opportunity

219
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,640
to be your last.

220
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,440
In this world,

221
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,920
no one can do things happily.

222
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,440
I can't.

223
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
Neither can you.
