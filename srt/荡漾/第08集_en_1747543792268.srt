1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm done. Why are you still not ordering?

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,400
You're being framed and blackmailed right now.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,200
You're saying that you're the King of the Sea.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,600
You're the King of the Sea.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,800
Lower your voice.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,200
You think no one knows you with a mask on?

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,800
If I eat alone and get photographed again,

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
what if someone cuts me off?

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Just a meal.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,200
I should go back.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm busy right now.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm going to the hospital.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,800
I'll be back soon.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
I'll be back soon.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
I'll be back soon.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,800
I'll be back soon.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll just eat some instant noodles.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
What instant noodles?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
You eat instant noodles every day. Look at you.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,600
You can talk but you don't have to.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm coming.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Excuse me.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
I agree.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
Please enjoy.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Eat some to replenish.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,400
Hello?

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Hello, Xing Yan.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Did you and Song Ruan stop eating at the restaurant we often go to?

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
I'll think of a way to leave.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Someone told me that the reporter is at the door.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Your photo is still on the hot search.

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,200
You can't get photographed with Song Ruan.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Okay, I know.

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,800
What's wrong?

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
There's a reporter. It's so troublesome.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
What should we do?

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm going to eat instant noodles.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
My mouth is open.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
How would I know? I'm just saying.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
As you wish.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,400
Eat some instant noodles.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Okay, delicious.

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,800
Are there anything wrong?

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
Hold this.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
What are you trying to do?

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
You haven't eaten anything?

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm still hungry.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,880
おっ

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,720
well

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,960
line

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
To

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,840
Also depresses and reprimands a person.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,600
Why did you do this?

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Don't handshake with me.

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Zi Li...

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,680
ista...

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
igent?

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,320
Jetzt mache du?

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,200
Ge!

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Nich Ky!

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,600
My little manager said

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,360
you left your bag in the car!

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
But it's alright.

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,280
So we still have school.

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,920
No.

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,120
No reporters at all.

67
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,560
Song.

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
Your internship

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
will be over in two months.

70
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
I've given you

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,920
such an important task

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,800
of shooting the documentary.

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
You have to do it well.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
If you can't do it well,

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll help you to transfer the certificate,

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,200
right?

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
What do you mean, team leader?

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
Is there anything wrong

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
with my documentary?

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
If you want to attract the audience,

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
you have to shoot some good news.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
Chu Xin Yan

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,880
met the girl

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,600
at the hotel two days ago.

85
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,280
You shoot this kind of thing.

86
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,440
Take her to meet the goddess in private.

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,160
Take a picture of her

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,760
as if she's a seaman.

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
She'll definitely be popular.

90
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
The documentary should record the truth.

91
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,680
She's not that kind of person.

92
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,840
I can't be a friend of her.

93
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,320
You have to be smart

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,000
and take some measures when necessary.

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
You're a woman.

96
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
She's a man.

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
When a man is under the protection,

98
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
he'll show his true face.

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,480
What are you talking about, team leader?

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't understand.

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,920
You're so smart.

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,760
If you can do it well,

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
I promise you'll transfer the certificate in advance.

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
The future is

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,200
more broad than you think.

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
But this is against

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
the professional ethics of the media.

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,840
This is a time of strong and weak.

109
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
You can step on others to get on the school.

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Others step on you.

111
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
Besides,

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
men are much worse than you think.

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,760
Don't look at him as handsome, right?

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't be deceived by the appearance, okay?

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
Okay, I won't say more.

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Do it yourself.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,560
Good.

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
drink some wine.

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:33,760
No.

120
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm not hungry.

121
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,800
Let's go.

122
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm not going.

123
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Xin Yan.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,520
You found my earrings.

127
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Xin Yan.

128
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Do you remember this earring?

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
This earring

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,560
was given to me

131
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,720
when we first dated.

132
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
You encouraged me

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,400
to stick to my dream of becoming an actress.

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,400
I'll always remember it.

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Every time I'm in trouble,

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
I look at it

137
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
and think about what you told me.

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm more confident.

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm just like the past.

140
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,800
In this world,

141
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
no one knows you better

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,560
than I do.

143
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Every word you say

144
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
has a purpose.

145
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
I can hear it all.

146
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,400
Xin Yan.

147
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,680
Is that how

148
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
you can help me

149
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
to read your mind?

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,080
It's hard for me to not read it.

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay.

152
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,320
Let's not talk about this.

153
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
Let's talk about you.

154
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm sorry

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
for the trouble I caused you.

156
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
It's not your fault.

157
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
I believe you're not like that.

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I can help you.

159
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
As long as you tell the audience

160
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,360
that we're a couple,

161
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,400
I can use my identity and status

162
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
to help you.

163
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
Thank you for your kindness.

164
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't need it.

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,120
Besides, we're over.

166
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Xin Yan.

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm the only one who can help you now.

168
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Why?

169
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
Because we're of the same height.

170
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,880
I want to see the scenery

171
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
with you.

172
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
You told me that.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
I was still young

174
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
and didn't understand the meaning of that.

175
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
I don't know

176
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
what price I should pay for that.

177
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,680
What price?

178
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,120
We're already

179
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,480
two different worlds.

180
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
Xin Yan.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,680
Are you afraid that

182
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,760
this will ruin your future?

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
Why are you here?

184
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,760
I didn't mean to.

186
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,560
I just wanted to talk to you.

187
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,360
Sorry to bother you.

188
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
What did you say?

189
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
It's not what you think.

190
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm not your who.

191
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
You don't have to explain it to me.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
Miss Song.

193
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Maybe we had a misunderstanding.

194
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
I apologize to you first.

195
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
You're so outstanding.

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,320
I wonder if you have time

197
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,080
to help me with a documentary.

198
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
Thank you for your compliment.

199
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,960
But I signed the contract

200
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,280
with Chu Xin Yan's personal documentary.

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
I'm only responsible for her.

202
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,040
That's a pity.

203
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,600
If you're interested,

204
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,800
we can talk about other cooperation.

205
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,280
She's my person now.

206
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,920
I'll decide

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,480
what to do next.

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
Why did you do that?

209
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,480
What?

210
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,240
Just like that.

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,640
You said I'm your person.

212
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
That's what you said.

213
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,640
You're my person.

214
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,760
But I just want to say

215
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,360
one percent of what I want to say.

216
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,400
You're shameless.

217
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,800
Why?

218
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,280
She's my junior.

219
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
We broke up long ago.

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
It's none of my business.

221
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,840
You don't have to explain it to me.

222
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,640
Why not?

223
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,120
You're my person.

224
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,520
You're here again.

225
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,160
What are we going to shoot today?

226
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
I can't.

227
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
There's a party tonight.

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can I go?

229
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,240
Why?

230
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
You want to drink?

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
But we've agreed

232
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,200
to shoot your life every day.

233
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
I didn't shoot anything today.

234
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,440
It's a deal.

235
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
I won't touch the ground.

236
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Will you drink?

237
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
Of course.

238
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,120
I'm a good drinker.

239
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Can I shoot you drinking?

240
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Sure.

241
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I'll drink.

242
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I'll drink.

243
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
