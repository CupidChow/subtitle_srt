1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I must be too tired recently.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I dream of Chu Qingyan?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's ridiculous.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're done.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Look at you.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Now you're always talking about Chu Qingyan.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Isn't this what you dream about every day?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This dream is a reminder.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't always run away from it.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But you don't know that he's a dangerous person.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He's always using me to step into his trap.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But once I step in, I'm done.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're rich and noble.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If he wants to use you, you can use him.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Use?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Think about it. What's the most important thing for you now?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a documentary.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You stand firm in your magazine.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then you become a real editor with a script.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And he's a top star. He has so many fans.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's a huge treasure.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If he wants to play, play with him.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
While he's interested in you,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
dig up his stories and secrets.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Maybe you can make a hit.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But that's not good.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you thinking about?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't you want your graduation certificate?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't you want to stand firm in your magazine?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't you want to realize your big dream?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Dream? That's right.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But...

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is a game.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're all players.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You take what you want.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't be too sincere.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you understand?

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay. I understand.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're scaring me.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello. You're Ms. Sun, right?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mr. Chu asked us to send you this.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He wants you to attend the party tonight.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Chu?

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, Mr. Chu.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you. You're welcome.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's this?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A dress?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Here you are.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Miss.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are...

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Chu Qingyan asked me to come.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Nan Yihang?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Who are you?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Director of his documentary.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're asking for Han An, right?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,560
Wrong? Then I'll call her.

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,220
Okay.

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,360
Hello.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,200
Zhou Yan, I'm already at Wanyan's place.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Where is Chu Xin Yan?

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,440
Wanyan?

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,120
Xin Yan has a notice today. She can't go there anymore.

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
She's shooting a poster.

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
It's not her.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,520
It's not her.

69
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,400
Then who gave it to her?

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,760
I've seen a lot of girls who pretend to be fans and want to get married.

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,720
Hurry up and leave.

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,880
We're pretending to be...

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
What are you doing?

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,920
Miss Lin.

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
I know this lady.

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,920
She's really Xin Yan's friend.

77
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,080
Okay.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,600
She's wearing a high-end dress.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,000
The quality is clearly different from the comparison.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
Her hair is also very rough.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
She's a newbie who just entered the circle.

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
She dares to wear the same clothes as Lin Hao Hao.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
I really thought that any female lead could play it.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
Dong Shi, Xiao Ping, you're bullying me.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,640
You're just helping her out.

86
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
It's okay. It's just a dress.

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,040
It's just that we all like the same thing.

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,080
But there are some things that you don't like

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,120
that you can match.

91
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,880
Here, let's eat something.

92
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,200
It's you.

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,640
What am I?

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
You...

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,440
Jiang Feng, you came at the right time.

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Could it be that Miss Song and I are fated to meet?

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,360
Can you take a picture for us?

98
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Sure.

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,640
I don't want to see you.

100
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm not going to see you.

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,840
I don't want to take a picture.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Are you crazy?

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,520
He's Lin Hao Hao.

104
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,480
Security.

105
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Where's the security?

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
He's here.

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
Drive this woman out.

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Okay.

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I can walk on my own.

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Let's go.

111
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I'm here.

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm late.

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Aren't you taking pictures of the poster?

115
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Since you're waiting for me,

116
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I'll take it faster.

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Xin Yan, why are you here?

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm late.

120
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Xin Yan.

129
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Let me introduce.

130
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
This is Song Ran from Dangyang magazine,

131
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
an excellent editor.

132
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,640
She's also the main person

133
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,240
in charge of my personal documentary.

134
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,840
She's also a good friend of mine.

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,640
I don't want anyone

136
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
to disrespect her

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
or treat her badly.

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Just friend?

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Well,

140
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,640
of the

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,600
present.

142
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
How is it?

143
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,380
Good, nothing much.

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
astes very delicious.

145
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Great.

146
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,940
Pork head.

147
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,040
Pork With northwest profile chips.

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
Who keep talking is you anymore.

149
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Can everyone be sure?

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Let me kill her.

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,040
再跟她聊聊天了

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Okay, bye.

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
Why did you do that?

154
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Ling Haohao

155
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,400
messed up your name

156
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
intentionally.

157
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
You always

158
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
do nice things.

159
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Why is it difficult

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,160
for you to get cheated

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:54,680
on something like that?

162
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,080
why you gonnaen

163
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Do you understand?

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,040
So,

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
follow me from now on.

166
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
Hold my big leg tightly.

167
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
No one dares to bully you.

168
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,520
Are you sure

169
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
Chu Xin Yan will be willing

170
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
to go back to the past with you?

171
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,720
Xin Yan,

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,080
have you seen this news?

173
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,120
There is a news that

174
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,760
C-Zinn, three characters, a small stream,

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,000
a hotel, three people.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
People on the Internet are guessing that it's you.

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
This news is covered with a video screenshot.

178
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,280
It really took you.

179
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,520
This is the hotel where you filmed the music video.

180
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,040
Although you have a mosaic on your face,

181
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,480
the slippers you wear on your feet

182
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,120
are the slippers

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
that the fans of the concert gave you.

184
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,320
Think about it.

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
What's going on?

186
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
If someone else has any unethical video,

187
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,120
you will really be in trouble.

188
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Jiang Feng, Jiang Feng.

189
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,640
Jiang Feng.

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,960
Jiang Feng.

191
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,680
What's your opinion on

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
Chu Xin Yan's three-character search?

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know much about Chu Xin Yan.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
She is very attractive.

195
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
It's normal for her to have many friends.

196
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,200
Can you tell us more about her?

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,760
Tell us more.

198
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,480
Song Ruan.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,760
Song Ruan.

200
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,520
Song Ruan.

201
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
This is Chu Xin Yan's

202
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
good friend.

203
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,360
She is also in charge of

204
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,840
shooting her personal documentary.

205
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
She must know Chu Xin Yan better than I do.

206
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,320
Song Ruan.

207
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,360
Song Ruan.

208
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,720
Song Ruan.

209
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,440
Song Ruan.

210
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
Why did Chu Xin Yan choose to

211
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
let you take her personal documentary?

212
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,040
Is Chu Xin Yan's personal life

213
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,240
really chaotic?

214
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Tell us more.

215
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,160
You are a young lady.

216
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
Why did she choose to let you take her

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,360
personal documentary?

218
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
What's the relationship?

219
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
Why did she choose to let you take her personal documentary?

220
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
During my shooting,

221
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
she has never violated

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
her moral behavior.

223
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
She has never had any

224
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
unethical relationship.

225
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,200
I hope you don't believe

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
the gossip on the Internet

227
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,680
and the malicious guidance of the newbies.

228
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Song Ruan.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
What's the relationship between you two?

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
You are a young lady.

231
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Why did she let you take her personal documentary?

232
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
Miss Yang.

233
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
We want to know.

234
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,480
I want to ask you...

235
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
What's the relationship between you two?

236
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
You are a young lady.

237
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,160
