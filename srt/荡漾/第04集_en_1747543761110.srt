00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I woke up so early to exercise.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I haven't slept enough and I haven't eaten breakfast.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's wrong, Song Da?

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You still have to get up early?

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why don't you run for a while and get some fresh air?

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please don't affect my work.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll go take a shower first. I'll treat you to breakfast later.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're a bit heartless.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I hope that I can be with you forever

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're like a flame in the air

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is that so?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My unease is scattered

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You appear in the vast world, grasping my light

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're covered in light

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Melt me once

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is better.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, Song.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Team leader, why are you here?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ouyang Zuo values you a lot.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He said that you're a newbie and asked me to teach you.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This artiste is late.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She didn't follow the notice and left.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Forget it. I'll wait for her.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, team leader.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I just took a picture.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Look.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your chance is wrong.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come on.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you want to make a man look good,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you have to lower your body.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like this, team leader?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Knock it up.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Like this?

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on. I'll help you.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This way.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Team leader, is that okay?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Team leader. Team leader, what are you doing?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Look.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This...

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Who? What are you doing?

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Misunderstanding.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm the chief editor of the Tang's Club, Cui Yongzhi.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm helping him adjust the position.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Song, explain it to me.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's our chief editor, Cui Yongzhi.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Chief editor Cui.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I thought you were a hooligan.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're doing this in the daytime.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm doing this for the documentary.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm teaching him how to adjust the position more professionally.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
More professional?

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Isn't this my documentary?

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I should be the one to adjust the position.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Besides, the contract emphasizes that

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
in order to protect my privacy,

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
only one cameraman is allowed to follow up.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes. Yes.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll leave then.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I won't bother you.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Song, good luck.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm leaving.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Good luck?

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Do I need to worry about it?

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How is it?

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you okay?

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm fine.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't just stand there. Have breakfast.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why is this girl so generous?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How did I know she's that kind of person?

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm just here to work.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No matter what you do in the future,

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you have to protect yourself first.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to resist the front-runners of this kind of workplace.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The main thing is that I didn't see it before.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What didn't you see?

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think you're very cruel to me.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so soft to others.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This kind of person is a stubborn person.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's a stubborn person.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you put up with him once,

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
he will challenge your bottom line endlessly.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next time, I'll...

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Next time? There's still next time?

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I just said it.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Forget it. It's no use telling you.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're so skinny.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You should work out your body first.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll teach you some defense techniques.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have to calm down when you encounter something.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Especially someone like you,

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
who has a weak body and physical condition,

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you can't compare yourself to others.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What should I compare myself to?

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do you think?

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How would I know?

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course, you have to compare yourself to skills.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Skills?

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come on, Awu.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Give me your fist.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you okay?

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm fine.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm fine.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm fine.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Today, I'll teach you a shoulder drop.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's do some exercises.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A fist fight.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If the opponent reveals a hand,

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
hit me.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
First, do a shoulder drop.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Grab his arm with your other hand.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You have to stick your upper body to his body.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Put your hand in his wrist.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This will be easier to use.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Turn around and close your legs.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Use your hip to touch his abdomen.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then,

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
pull your right arm towards your waist.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Come on, let's try it.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Here we go.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, the upper body is too far from me.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have to put your foot closer to me.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This will make it easier for you to lift your hips.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Turn around.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Turn around.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Come on, three, two, one.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you okay?

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Use your power of the red square.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What red square?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not okay.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm fine.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Use your power of the red square.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What power of the red square?

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the power of your ancestral 18 times.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your ancestral 18 times?

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Three, two, one.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Think about the safety distance.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Lie in your arms.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Give me all your courage.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Tell me,

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is he taking advantage of me?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What advantage?

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are you listening to me?

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm being serious.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's wrong with him?

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He took me to practice defense today.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm about to fall apart.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He made you fall apart?

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not what you think.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's taking me to the edge.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like the cannon ball against Luo Jin.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Think about it. He's going to fall apart.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He just wants to play with you.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
See if he's interested in you.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Stop.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Acting is acting.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll help you.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The front is the peach blossom.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The back is the peach blossom.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Look, the peach blossom.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Chu Xingyan and me.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's such a big star.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who am I?

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You don't lack legs.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And he's acting like that

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
because he likes you.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want to be a fish in his fish pond.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There can be many fish ponds.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He has his own sea.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have your own waves.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just heard you say that

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
he's gentle, considerate, and caring.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Except for missing occasionally

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and not knowing how to make public relations.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He's not lacking at all.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Imagine falling in love with a handsome guy.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How interesting.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Remember,

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
more friends, more ways,

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
more partners, more families.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't want to fall in love now.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I just want to finish my job.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not a conflict with love.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can pay the public expenses

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
while you're in love.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Such a good thing.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can't go.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't make the same mistake

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
for the second time.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He doesn't suit me.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He doesn't suit me.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Remember,

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
he doesn't suit me.

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's so troublesome.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't be nervous.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm looking out the door.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's not hiding from you.

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So many reporters.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I guess he's a star.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go back.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Lin Hao, come and look.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Look over there.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Lin Hao, come.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come and look.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Look at the camera.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Lin Hao, look at the camera.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Look at the camera.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Look here.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look at the camera.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, okay.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're so annoying.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, okay.

224
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Are you here to shoot a new drama?

225
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Hao Hao, you are the best female lead in this season.

226
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Do you have anything to say?

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Sorry, sorry.

228
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,080
We don't accept any interviews.

229
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,160
Please continue to follow the official news.

230
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,800
Thank you.

231
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Please forgive us.

232
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay, okay.

233
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
Please forgive us.

234
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,080
Please forgive us.

235
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,240
Chu Xinran, you're so nice.

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
Chu Xinran.

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
They haven't been on the same stage for three years.

238
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
Is there a new drama to cooperate with?

239
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Say something.

240
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,120
Chu Xinran.

241
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Chu Xinran.

242
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,200
Say something.

243
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Please give us some news.

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
You and Mr. Lin are going to break up.

245
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,080
Chu Xinran.

246
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
Chu Xinran, you're so nice.

247
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Is there a new drama?
