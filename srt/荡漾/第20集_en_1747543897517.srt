1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Girlfriend

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Chu Xin Yan,

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I came here today to say goodbye to you.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The footage of the documentary is enough.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We can stop filming.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What do you mean? You are my girlfriend.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Even if we finish filming, you can stay by my side.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What's wrong?

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
There are some things

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that even if we say it clearly,

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it's meaningless.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ruan Ruan!

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why are you here?

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Shouldn't you be filming in the crew?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You came out so casually because you were irresponsible to your crew.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You let the crew save you.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know how to be a businessman.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You also know that I'm always on the air.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then why did you leave me with a Yuan Si Tan?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why did you come and leave my world?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was too naive.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I only found out today

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that the gap between us is this big.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No one will bless us, your family, fans, or friends.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want you to suffer from unnecessary pressure because of me one day.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I'm afraid to bear those bad eyes.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Chu Qing Yan.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why are you so stupid?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That star, Chu Qing Yan,

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
was shining because of you.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You lit up her world.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You saved her dream.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How could you not deserve her?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
She doesn't deserve you.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because of me,

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
my brother was able to put that girl in my apartment.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ruo Ruo, you're sauteingbetween the dishes.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ruo Ruo.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not as cute as you'd think.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,280
are all under the spotlight.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Your relationship

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
is not about two people.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,120
You have to think about it a lot.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,240
Why not?

48
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
If you want to leave today,

49
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,440
I'll tell everyone

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
about our relationship.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
Are you crazy?

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,560
I don't care

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
what others think about this relationship.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
I only care about you.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you understand?

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,920
Where are you going?

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,600
Don't be like a child.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm a child.

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,200
Let go.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,080
No.

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
No!

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,560
What's wrong?

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
If you hold me like this,

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
I won't let go.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
Get out of the way.

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
Why are you so angry?

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,160
I said

68
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,200
Chu Xin Yan

69
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
is not the same Chu Xin Yan.

70
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
She is in the studio

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
and making love with that vulgar person every day.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,720
She doesn't care about your feelings.

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,600
Shut up.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Okay.

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,040
Only I love you sincerely.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,480
As long as you say it,

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll kick Chu Xin Yan out of the crew.

78
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
I'll be the one to do it.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
I'll be the one to do it.

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
I'll be the one to do it.

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll be the one to do it.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll kick Chu Xin Yan out of the crew

83
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,160
and make you feel bad.

84
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,600
Don't touch me.

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
I don't need it.

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
Do you think I don't know

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,040
that you made the video of the three-person group?

88
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
No matter how much I hate them,

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
I don't want to use this kind of method.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
And

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,920
even if Xin Yan doesn't like me,

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,760
I won't accept you.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
You are never

94
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
as good as her in my heart.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,040
Chu Xin Yan.

96
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
Wait and see.

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
Do you really not want me to go back?

98
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
Today's show

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,360
is over.

100
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,320
Chu Xin Yan's

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
awards

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,820
Brown-necked

103
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,400
Hello.

104
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,680
Excuse me.

105
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,060
Still come?

106
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Who doesn't want to?

107
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,560
Stop it.

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
You have to film today.

109
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,040
You're welcome.

110
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
How is it, Song Da Hao?

111
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Is your work hard?

112
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,040
It's not hard.

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,720
It's just that you talk too much.

114
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm almost blind.

115
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Do you want to order a bowl of chicken soup?

116
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
No.

117
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,760
I can handle it.

118
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
I get used to it.

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,160
You are fabulous.

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Then I'll try to wear a wig for you.

121
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll talk less in the future.

122
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
What's wrong?

123
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll go first.

124
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,480
The big branch has requested

125
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
to adjust your score.

126
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Adjust?

127
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
What do you mean?

128
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Well, Xun Yi.

129
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
The branch requested

130
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
to adjust your score with Jiang Feng.

131
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,680
There may be some changes in the range.

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,480
He'll be the team leader in the future.

133
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
You're the man?

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,680
How is that possible?

135
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,480
We've signed the contract.

136
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm the man.

137
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,400
The situation is complicated.

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,680
The branch has always admired Jiang Feng.

139
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
That's why we set up

140
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Jiang Feng to be the man.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
But now...

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,880
Now he's the boyfriend of the branch.

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
So the branch strongly requested

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,880
to let Jiang Feng be the man.

145
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,360
We have no choice.

146
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,660
But you know the Final Fantasy cer were

147
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,400
not released.

148
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
When the three crimes conspirated,

149
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,540
the entire Something Branch

150
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,680
is under the influence

151
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,080
of his control.

152
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,860
So Song Xia graceful

153
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
said to Appear!

154
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm隻八頭弄哔.

155
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
OK.

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,600
what��� Guys,

157
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,040
Stop!

158
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm the suggestive one.

159
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,960
You're the quack.

160
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
In a fist fight,

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
you're theята.

162
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
We're helpless.

164
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,480
We can only

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
have three years of peace.

166
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm sorry, Xing Yan.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,800
I've tried my best

168
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
to get what you want.

169
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,560
But Zifang's attitude is too tough.

170
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
I have no room to back down.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,920
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,680
Don't let him falling in love.

173
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,920
I can't blame him.

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,440
You've suffered a lot.

175
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
