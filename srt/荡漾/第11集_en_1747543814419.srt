00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,160
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
Episode 27

3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,640
OK, very good.

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Very good, very handsome.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,000
OK, raise your chin a little bit.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,720
OK.

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm done here.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
Please take a rest first.

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,920
Xiaodi, turn on the light.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,440
OK.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Thank you.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
Here, the light is on.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,600
Put it here.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,360
Hello, director.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,320
Well, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm late.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
There's a traffic jam on the way.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,160
I thought you weren't coming.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,280
I have a planned shooting plan today.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Why don't I come?

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
I'm a very public figure.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm afraid you're embarrassed.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
Why should I be embarrassed?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm sorry to see you.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm a very professional person, OK?

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Hello, graduation party?

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,080
Forget it.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm not going.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
You can go by yourself.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Why don't you go?

31
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,960
Why are you eavesdropping on others' calls?

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,880
Eavesdropping?

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
What eavesdropping?

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,200
We're so close.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,240
I don't have to eavesdrop.

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
So why don't you go?

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,480
There are people I don't want to see.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,520
I don't know what happened specifically.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,280
But I think

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
running away

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
can't solve the problem.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Sometimes the more you run away,

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
the more he feels

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
you care about him.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,520
So you have to learn to face everything.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Only by facing it

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,360
can you really let go.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,560
It's not as simple as you think.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,520
My ex-boyfriend?

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
You haven't let go of him?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,880
Stop gossiping.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,520
I hate it when a couple is together for three years.

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Finally, they're together again.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,680
But they still go back to the past and say they love each other.

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,080
This is not a movie.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,680
It's obviously a love story.

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,600
I'm so thirsty.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,880
My couple is going to be a couple again.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Chu Xin Yan.

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,520
Do you think you can win this?

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
This movie

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,480
is still behind the scenes.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
What time is it?

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,960
Xin Xin doesn't answer me.

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
Are you all here?

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
Let's start.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Let's start from the first scene.

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,880
Sorry.

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,520
I decided to attend the graduation party.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,760
I won't read the script today.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
So you have to learn to face everything.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Only by facing it

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,680
can you really let go.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not as simple as you think.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
My ex-boyfriend?

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
You haven't let go of him?

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
Junior.

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
It's been a long time.

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
Why are you so pretty again?

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
Senior.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,080
It's been a long time.

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,960
Why are you more handsome than before?

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,400
Really?

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,480
Can I be closer to you?

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Can I be closer to you?

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
Of course.

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh no.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
Baby.

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,800
Ever since we broke up,

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,360
I've been missing you all the time.

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
I really know I was wrong.

92
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,160
Let's make up.

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,120
I'll treat you well.

94
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
Okay?

95
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,720
Let go!

96
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,240
Xun Yan.

97
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
The script is so good.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,160
It's a big hit.

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Let's continue.

100
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Let's watch the second episode.

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
Let's cheer up!

102
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,620
descrip сво sur-ré- kindly

103
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,200
Let's carry on alright?

104
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
Remember toThanks, let's go.

105
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
See you.

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
See you.

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Thank you.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,800
Come here.

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,040
I heard that the assistant coach and we are going to have a good time.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
Really?

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,000
I heard that the assistant coach is closer to Song Ruan.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,600
Ruan, you said you wouldn't come.

113
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
I figured it out.

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
Escaping is not a solution.

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
The more I am,

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
some people may think I care more.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,160
You finally figured it out.

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,840
Drink.

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000
Ji Bai Qi, Song Ruan.

120
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
What are you two doing here?

121
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,080
Nothing.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,240
How about we play the treasure hunt adventure?

123
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,040
Sure.

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,080
That's great.

125
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
That's great.

126
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,880
Let's grab the bottle.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Sure.

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,640
I'll grab it.

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,920
Song Ruan.

130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I have a question.

131
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,640
Song Ruan,

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Song Ruan,

133
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,920
I heard that there is a rumor that you and the big star Chu Xin Yan are working together.

134
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Is that true?

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
Chu Xin Yan?

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Chu Xin Yan.

137
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Yes.

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Then is that star like what the Internet says,

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,600
living in chaos and having a beautiful girl as her partner?

140
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,640
Is there any internal gossip?

141
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
It's not that exaggerated.

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
It's just like ordinary people like us.

143
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,360
Sometimes we may have more troubles.

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
You're so sly.

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,360
They make so much money.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
What's the big deal?

147
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah.

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,840
Are you still together?

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
No.

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Don't be too self-willed, okay?

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Song Ruan is with the super star every day.

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,040
Who cares about the past?

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,680
Really?

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
Song Ruan, are you in love?

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
No, I'm not.

156
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't listen to him.

157
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm just making a documentary.

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it also with the star?

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,320
It's her.

160
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,600
Chu Xin Yan.

161
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,120
I promise I'll make a documentary with the star.

162
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
I love you.

163
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
Chu Xin Yan.

164
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Really?

165
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,160
Yes.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,480
Are you serious?

167
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,080
I don't know.

168
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,840
Song Ruan.

169
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,560
I know you want to prove that you're doing well.

170
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,480
But you don't have to lie to satisfy your heart.

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm not lying.

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,280
You're just bragging.

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm not.

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm serious.

175
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,800
I love her so much.

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,680
I want to see her photos.

177
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
I usually take documentary photos.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
I don't take photos.

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,040
Call her and let us hear her voice.

180
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
She has work tonight.

181
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,960
I can't bother her.

182
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
Enough.

183
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,440
Don't force her.

184
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,160
Let's eat something.

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Okay.

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay.

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,120
Cheers.

188
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
Have fun tonight.

189
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Okay.

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,960
Here.

191
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,640
Have fun.

192
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,920
Song Ruan.

193
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,080
You should work after graduation.

194
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,760
Don't be so self-conscious.

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
So romantic.

196
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Song Ruan.

197
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,320
Who is he?

198
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,960
Who is he?

199
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,840
Do you know him?

200
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Who is he?

201
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,080
Who is he?

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Why is he here?

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,080
Here.

204
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,120
Why are you here?

205
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
You want to set me free, right?

206
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,840
Listen.

207
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,160
The voice in my heart.

208
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,240
It seems like a dream.

209
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
I'm here to ask you about your plan for tomorrow.

210
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,720
After all, you're in charge of my solo documentary.

211
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,480
I have to make an appointment with you in advance.
