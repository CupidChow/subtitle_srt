1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,389
Grandma often insulted me for behaving like my mom.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,020
I just came to realize that.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,409
Mom she talked about is the one who gave birth to me.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,859
Excuse me, I'll reserve it now.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,149
You're like my hero.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,919
I don't want others to look down on us again.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Got it?

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,559
Hey! What are you doing?!

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,729
Let go of me!

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,560
Who hurt my son!?

11
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,639
Mrs. Venus, please help me!

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,640
(Mr. Kul, please pay the down payment now.)

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,680
Hello? Kong.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,670
Where is Max?

15
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:28,799
Bastard!

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,689
What right do you have to hurt other people?

17
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,690
Can't you see how much he hurt Top?

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,630
I don't trust Max

19
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,989
since I've found out he works for your mom

20
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,619
to spy on us and Kanya.

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,030
How could you do this to me?

22
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,899
I've always treated you well.

23
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,980
Recent hot news reveals about Mrs. Venus, the owner of Youth Club,

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,479
The insider spills the tea

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,520
that the man with her in the car is not just her friend.

26
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,999
Who can I trust from now on?

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,489
But now, all of you, get out.

28
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,150
Get out!

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,680
Please make yourselves at home.

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,930
Jate.

31
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,929
Please take a picture for us.

32
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,620
Sure.

33
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,350
This is Jate,

34
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,749
my wife's friend.

35
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,799
He's also our family's photographer.

36
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,989
1... 2...

37
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,520
Done.

38
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,259
Nus, this is Mr. Manop.

39
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,969
He'll be co-investing with us.

40
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,229
I asked Mr. Manop and his family to join us for a meal

41
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,279
so that we'd get closer.

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,889
It's my pleasure.

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,579
It's a beautiful house you have.

44
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,409
It's Nus' family villa.

45
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,790
We usually come here for vacation.

46
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,559
Oh, Kong. Come here.

47
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,699
Is this your son?

48
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,589
He's my middle child, Kong.

49
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,069
Is this Copter?

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,660
Yes.

51
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,659
They're probably the same age.

52
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,159
What about you guys go and play together?

53
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,689
- Want to ask your friend to play together?
- Yes.

54
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,499
Okay, then take care of your friend.

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,759
Go play with your friend, Copter.

56
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,309
Don't be naughty.

57
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,309
Then you guys better take care of the guests,

58
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,609
I will take care of the children.

59
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,709
I'll leave it to you.

60
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,569
Sure.

61
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,599
This is great.

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,179
So the children would become closer.

63
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,489
Maybe they could work together when they grow up.

64
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,099
That'd be great.

65
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,720
Please go ahead.

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,210
Copter!

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
You murderer!

68
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,439
I can assure you.

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,380
Kong didn't mean it.

70
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:37,429
It was an accident.

71
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,289
But their son's dead.

72
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,839
If it wasn't Kong,

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,630
then who's the culprit?

74
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:42,839
Wat!

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,919
How can you say he's the culprit when he didn't do anything?

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,419
I will never invest in anything with you ever again.

77
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,059
We shall never work together in this lifetime!

78
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,109
You see?

79
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,790
Everything is ruined because of him.

80
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,840
I'll never accept you as my son.

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,119
(V Construction's trying their best to go on despite -39% margin, signaling a tremendous loss.) -
(Thachai's ready to take his first year of office after a landslide win, devoted to helping the people.)

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,689
If you agree to the deal I offer,

83
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,860
we can work together.

84
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,649
I'm willing to accept any offer.

85
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,649
Thank you so much for helping.

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,330
One more condition.

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,969
The issue about your son.

88
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,459
End things swiftly.

89
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,789
Make sure no news is leaking.

90
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,819
I don't like it when people dig up scandalous things

91
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,499
that could ruin our business.

92
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,260
You have my words.

93
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll make sure he has no presence.

94
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,679
One more picture.

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
1... 2... 3...

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,669
(Wait for me, Kong.)

97
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,190
(I'll find a way to fix this someday.)

DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,969
On the topic of the morality of this election's candidate,

107
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,759
Mrs. Venus' case has been widely brought to attention.

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,790
The instance of scandal between her and her male friend

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,430
seems to signal a romantic affair.

110
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,289
As well as, the student under her support resorting to violence.

111
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,429
I think this has a negative impact on our team.

112
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,279
We might have to postpone the publicity of Mrs. Venus' candidacy.

113
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,009
Isn't that just running away from the problem?

114
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,139
No, it's not.

115
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,189
We have to step back and prove ourselves.

116
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,900
Otherwise, all the things we have been building will end up in ruins.

117
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,569
I have resigned from the university to prove my innocence.

118
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,679
I was planning to fully support Mrs. Venus up.

119
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,309
But when the game gets dirty like this,

120
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,309
I don't think we can use the conventional way to get back at them.

121
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,499
That's only when we have enough evidence.

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,959
Just wait a little longer.

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,360
There will be enough evidence.

124
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,249
If we're not going to start clean,

125
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,960
then we have to take it all the way.

126
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,940
We don't have that much spare time for waiting.

127
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,219
Thank you so much for visiting my grandma.

128
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,189
But you should go home and rest.

129
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,899
I know that you're going through a lot on your own.

130
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,029
Even though I can't help,

131
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm rooting for you.

132
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,270
And for your sister too.

133
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,009
It's totally fine.

134
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,410
You can cry if you're sad.

135
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,510
Who do you like then?

136
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,470
Tell me who.

137
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,750
Pali.

138
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,749
Is it okay for me to visit?

139
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,749
Why wouldn't it be?

140
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,439
I was afraid

141
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,270
that you'd still hate me.

142
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,760
I don't hate anyone.

143
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,969
Nor am I still angry at anyone.

144
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,209
There have been things that were beyond my control.

145
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,139
So I just let it be.

146
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,820
I want to move on already.

147
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,490
You're so strong.

148
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,279
We're all going through a lot.

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,689
Let's support each other

150
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,370
and get through it together instead.

151
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,910
I've heard from May

152
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,930
that you want to meet your real mother.

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,159
So...

154
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,229
I and Kanya want to help you out.

155
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,830
So we did some research.

156
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,320
Maybe it would make you feel better.

157
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,200
Thank you so much.

158
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,989
That handsome boy's friend, May,

159
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,389
just transferred me some money again.

160
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,440
For having him sing here?

161
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,879
If I really helped draw people into your place.

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,009
Then I'm glad.

163
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,469
Then you would have me here for a long time.

164
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,129
Well, as long as that person's willing to cover your pay.

165
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,860
It's nice to be handsome.

166
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:06,209
People even pay you to be hired.

167
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,430
Hey, Peem. You're early.

168
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,100
I heard everything.

169
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,749
So what?

170
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,829
I quit.

171
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,029
Why are you being so dramatic?

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,599
I didn't pass the audition by myself.

173
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,909
I got this job because someone bribed you.

174
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,910
I want to take responsibility.

175
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,729
Do you feel that guilty?

176
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,730
I do.

177
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,999
Let's do this.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,209
Play me a song, any song.

179
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,849
Huh?

180
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,619
Just do it.

181
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,259
Just one song.

182
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,259
I want to hear.

183
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Go on, Peem.

184
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,950
You didn't bring your car, did you?

185
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,749
Then let's take Tam home first.

186
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

187
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,280
If you like her, you should just tell her.

188
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,300
Not everything can wait.

189
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,470
How did you know?

190
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,079
I'm your friend.

191
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,359
What sort of friend are you?

192
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,479
Did you just realize it now?

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
A bad friend, perhaps.

194
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,829
I'm worried that she might feel bad.

195
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,629
Because you used to be in the talking stage with her.

196
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,389
And if I happen to tell Tam how I feel.

197
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,060
Tam might think that I and you are fooling around with her.

198
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,340
Honestly,

199
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,319
if you're really sincere about your feelings for her,

200
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,490
then the past isn't a problem.

201
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,509
I think

202
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,620
you should let Tam be the one to judge.

203
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,269
I'm just...

204
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,270
I'm just afraid.

205
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,479
I'm afraid to lose a friend.

206
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Just like how you did.

207
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,409
Don't be afraid.

208
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,839
Sometimes if you don't say anything,

209
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,130
you might end up losing everything.

210
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,109
I'll take my leave.

211
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,689
You can go wherever you want.

212
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,359
Just get here on time.

213
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,230
What?

214
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,979
Let me tell you what.

215
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,089
I hire you because you're good at playing the instrument

216
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,359
and at singing.

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,029
Haven't you heard your own voice before?

218
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,949
But the tips she gave me,

219
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,089
I consider that my tips.

220
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,599
Am I guilty of that?

221
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,090
I'm just taking the tips from your friend.

222
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,889
Would that be okay?

223
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,870
Of course it is.

224
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,739
Why are you so worked up about it?

225
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,659
Are you embarrassed to have someone paying for you?

226
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,929
Let me tell you something.

227
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,039
First off, you should be proud of your skills

228
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,329
because you're good with your instrument and singing.

229
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,919
Second, you should say thank you to the person giving you the money.

230
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,309
Your friend, that is.

231
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,899
For me,

232
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,940
I'd call her a true friend.

233
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
Seriously.

234
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,590
Kong.

235
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,589
Come on, let's go.

236
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,320
What?

237
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,320
Where are we going, Gun?

238
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,179
Why are people in this house acting all mysterious?

239
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,459
It's suffocating, you know?

240
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,260
Kong.

241
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,709
This is not the time to be all curious.

242
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,710
Let's go.

243
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,080
What the heck?

244
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,310
Gun.

245
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,060
Let's talk about it later.

246
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:34,259
What's going on?

247
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's get out and talk.

248
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,239
What the heck?

249
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,789
Where are you taking me?

250
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,939
We're meeting Mom at our countryside villa.

251
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,920
Good.

252
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,379
I want to talk it out with Mom too.

253
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,089
I can't stand this situation anymore.

254
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,289
I don't even know what others are thinking of our family right now.

255
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,290
Stop.

256
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,139
You guys listen to me.

257
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,720
Our family's situation is not in a normal state right now.

258
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,290
The one who caused Mom's accident

259
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,430
is our very own Father.

260
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,790
How can that be?

261
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,620
Listen.

262
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,660
Our parents parted ways long ago.

263
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,899
They meet occasionally

264
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,079
to maintain their social status.

265
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,749
So Dad would seem like a famous businessman

266
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,429
who lives a conventional life.

267
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,429
But the one who has to bear all the unconventionals

268
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,090
is mom.

269
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,650
We can no longer run away from the truth.

270
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,939
Dad is ruining everything.

271
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,870
In a time like this, can I ask you...

272
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,530
Can I ask you guys to be on Mom's side with me?

273
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,209
I'm ready.

274
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,210
We should get going.

275
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,970
Hey.

276
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,969
What are you doing in my room?

277
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,409
Grabbing my stuff.

278
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,579
I made up my mind.

279
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm planning to donate the stuff I don't need anymore.

280
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,160
But I think I'll keep these,

281
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,700
my dad's bracelets.

282
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,080
And I'm here to talk to my dad.

283
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,699
What?

284
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Talk to your dad?

285
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,969
Your dad

286
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,579
isn't here anymore, is he?

287
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,779
Yeah.

288
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,149
My dad passed away.

289
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,710
In this very room, actually.

290
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,170
At first when I let you stay here,

291
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,180
I want to feel like

292
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,039
there is someone still living here.

293
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,920
To hear some sounds.

294
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,570
But I'm just lying to myself that my dad's still here.

295
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,100
But I'm glad that it's you who live here now.

296
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,280
And I'm sure my dad's glad too.

297
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,500
No need to be scared.

298
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,199
My dad would love you too.

299
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,560
Trust me.

300
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,459
Thank you so much.

301
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,999
For everything.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,779
For the things you told me and things you never told me.

303
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,560
Thank you so much, really.

304
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,669
Don't be so sentimental.

305
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,979
I don't like it.

306
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,179
Then

307
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,179
I have a question.

308
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,400
What's the scariest type of money?

309
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,770
Money shortage.

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,199
Oh?

311
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,879
Wrong.

312
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,879
But I'd consider it an interesting answer.

313
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,879
Then try telling me the right answer.

314
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,149
I want to know what you're going to say.

315
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,539
Money cut.

316
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,480
Ouch!

317
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,819
Cut my butt.

318
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,169
Are you cussing at me or Karn?

319
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,040
At you!

320
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,430
By the way.

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,560
I think we should let Mink come back and stay here.

322
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,299
Karn doesn't know this place.

323
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,399
And on that day,

324
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,100
I'll be the one to lure Karn out of the house.

325
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,670
Why did you decide to take me here?

326
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,000
Seems fun, isn't it?

327
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,810
I'm excited every time I see you.

328
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,370
You would be more excited than ever this time.

329
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,170
Then you go get the stuff.

330
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,439
You know,

331
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,429
I'm the goddess of this place's favorite.

332
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,399
Whenever I invite anyone here, no one agrees to come.

333
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,139
There's only you

334
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,610
who let me do whatever I want.

335
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,389
Let's see

336
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,389
who would be the luckier one

337
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,890
between me and you.

338
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,069
The CCTV at Karn's place should all be gone already.

339
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,310
Just like what Mink said.

340
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,360
The key is on the lamp at the entrance.

341
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,899
Damn it.

342
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,189
I feel like I'm going to war.

343
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,370
It's similar, actually.

344
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,809
It's similar in the fact that

345
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,290
you can really die from it.

346
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes!

347
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,040
Perhaps today's not your day.

348
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,629
You should go ahead into the bedroom.

349
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,090
There's one drawer by the bed.

350
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,790
I keep the important stuff in there.

351
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,649
Where are you going?

352
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,099
Suddenly quitting is pretty rude.

353
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,770
I don't find it fun anymore.

354
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,199
Here.

355
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,020
Take a sip to cool your head.

356
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
I want to go home already.

357
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,829
Why don't you try one more time?

358
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,129
You're definitely winning this time.

359
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,829
The goddess was just teasing you just now.

360
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,359
That'd be a waste of time.

361
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,560
My luck is not here.

362
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,619
If you're bored,

363
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,910
we can go somewhere else first.

364
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,719
Can we go to your place?

365
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,109
I've never been there before.

366
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,579
I don't think that's a good idea.

367
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,359
I'm not comfortable with that.

368
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,409
My dad's there.

369
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,409
I went through your Instagram.

370
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,410
Didn't your dad pass away?

371
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,169
The ghost of my dad.

372
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,170
He's very vicious.

373
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,530
Then let's go somewhere else.

374
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,179
Where shall we go?

375
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,540
To my house.

376
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,019
It's much more fun there.

377
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,279
My luck's there.

378
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,190
Let's go.

379
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,859
Get up.

380
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,480
Quick.

381
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,659
Is there anywhere else where the stuff would be kept?

382
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,219
(Go check the drawers downstairs.)

383
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,740
(The one at the bookcase.)

384
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,080
Who are you texting?

385
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,769
No one.

386
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,400
Password?

387
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,119
Anywhere else?

388
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,179
I've been looking all over.

389
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,519
He must be coming back.

390
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,189
(Can you try looking in my bedroom one more time?)

391
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,460
Okay.

392
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,970
Karn!

393
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:10,120
Stay still.

394
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,090
Karn!

395
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,540
What are you doing?

396
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,609
Stay still!

397
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,250
Hey!

398
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,359
Still!

399
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,940
Hey!

400
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,050
Karn!

401
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,410
You bastard!

402
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,070
Hey!

403
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,520
Stop right there!

404
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,759
Hey, May.

405
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,969
Where are you?

406
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,889
I'm in my house.

407
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,889
Watching your kiddy game.

408
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,329
It's pretty simple. I saw right through it.

409
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,579
One problem, though.

410
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,579
That fox, your friend,

411
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,460
might be getting burned by the sun in the car.

412
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,310
Let go of me!

413
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,180
Karn!

414
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,250
Let go of me!

415
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,110
Karn!

416
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,670
You bastard, Karn!

417
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,419
That's loud!

418
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
Karn.

419
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Karn!

420
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,690
Hey!

421
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,440
Karn!

422
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:42,440
Do you want me to call the police?

423
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,540
Damn it!

424
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,169
I sent someone over to get the stuff.

425
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,449
The plate is 3571.

426
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,759
You can hand it over to him.

427
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
It's for everyone's safety.

428
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,909
Here it is.

429
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,190
Thank you.

430
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,270
May!

431
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,100
Let's go.

432
00:26:30,101 --> 00:26:31,319
Before he drives after us.

433
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,400
He wouldn't be able to use his car for a while.

434
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,070
Damn it!

435
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,070
The shop is closed.

436
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,449
Karn.

437
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,400
Why are you here?

438
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,759
To see Mink.

439
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,969
You know she doesn't usually come home.

440
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,969
Why are you looking for her here?

441
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,639
What are you guys on about?

442
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,809
You really don't know your sister.

443
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,009
Including your friends.

444
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,859
What sort of friends are you?

445
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,569
They are ganging up together.

446
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,570
Ganging up together doing what?

447
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,550
What are they up to?

448
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,959
Stealing.

449
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,959
Both your sister and your friends

450
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,569
are about to be in trouble.

451
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,319
Go tell them to return all the stuff to me.

452
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,989
I'm giving you two days.

453
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,989
And I mean, all the stuff.

454
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,360
You tell your sister, she knows.

455
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,619
Where's Mink?

456
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,209
I'm asking you where Mink is.

457
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,289
What rights have you to meddle with my sister?

458
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,589
And what the hell is wrong with you?

459
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,109
Don't you know what your sister's facing?

460
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,429
How can your family let her get hunted down and hurt like this?

461
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,069
Huh?

462
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,089
Do you even know that she needs to fight for
her life to get the evidence for the lawsuit?

463
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,759
Why does a girl have to go through all these damn things on her own?

464
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,759
Mink?

465
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,209
Getting hurt?

466
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,919
Getting hunted?

467
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,119
What the hell?

468
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,299
There you go.

469
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,100
You never cared about your sister.

470
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,850
Mink.

471
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,289
Don't stick your nose in.

472
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,050
Mink.

473
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:33,319
Come out, let's talk.

474
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,740
Guys.

475
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,899
Mink's gone.

476
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,410
My dad's bracelets are gone too.

477
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,169
Have we ever been here before, Gun?

478
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,780
Of course, we have.

479
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,690
When we were very young.

480
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,530
Let's go.

481
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,240
Mom.

482
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,200
Is there anything I can do to make you hate me less?

483
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,800
Mom!

484
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,800
Mom.

485
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,830
(No!)

486
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,410
(Let me play with you!)

487
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,150
(No!)

488
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,070
(Let me play with you!)

489
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:16,500
(No!)

490
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,490
What's going on, Mom?

491
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,060
(Let me play with you!)

492
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
(No!)

493
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,119
Why do I feel like it happened before?

494
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,480
(Let me play with you.)

495
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,239
(Copter!)

496
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,959
It's like I was the reason someone fell down the stairs.

497
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,180
At this place.

498
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,939
How can you say that to our son?

499
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,069
Why not?

500
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,389
He's the culprit.

501
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,946
- Did you see with your eyes that he did it?
- It's okay, Kong.

502
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,259
This has nothing to do with you.

503
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,540
Murderer!

504
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,839
It's a long time ago, Kong.

505
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,089
I wanted you to forget about it.

506
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,530
But it has become the reason you're being forgotten.

507
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,090
I made the wrong choice, Kong.

508
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,990
Where is your middle child, by the way?

509
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,219
I don't want Kong to be on any media.

510
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,979
I want him to feel safe.

511
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,629
Because perhaps

512
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,680
someone might want to use his past against him.

513
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,849
Even though he didn't do it,

514
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm worried for my child.

515
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,709
All the evidence I have

516
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,710
should probably be enough.

517
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,469
Ever since what happened to Kong,

518
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,469
Dad decided to go on another path entirely.

519
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,089
He doesn't care about anything but money.

520
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,699
So I decided to leave the business we built together

521
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,699
for my own safety.

522
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,209
So I wouldn't have anything to do with the dirty businesses.

523
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,659
And after that,

524
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,389
it's all about gathering the evidence.

525
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,109
There's only Gun

526
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,220
who's working with Dad and helping me from afar.

527
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,010
There is a lot more dirty business Dad's doing with Thachai.

528
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,119
Thank you, Gun, for doing the right thing

529
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,510
even though you must be in a tough spot.

530
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,910
Mom.

531
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,719
Does Dad have to go to this extent with us?

532
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,119
He can do much more than this.

533
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,000
He's trying to pair up Kanya with Top, Thachai's son.

534
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,790
The reason why I'm trying to quickly send Kanya to the States

535
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,579
is not because of Pali.

536
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,670
But because of this.

537
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,759
Then why do you have Max reporting to you about me and Kanya?

538
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,919
Because I know I can't get close to you and your sister.

539
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,839
So I need someone to look out in my stead.

540
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,139
And I thought having Max watching over you

541
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,849
isn't like you're being trailed or anything.

542
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,240
It's for everyone's safety.

543
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,719
The first day of your party

544
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,049
when someone barged in and wrecked it,

545
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,299
those were your Dad's people.

546
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,009
He meant to play me over

547
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,719
ever since I announced that I'd become Thachai's competitor.

548
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,899
He believed that the party was actually Youth Club's event.

549
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,619
That means.

550
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,209
Max's incident is what ticks them off.

551
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,629
Since our people hurt his son.

552
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,589
That's the spark to all the fires.

553
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,369
He just wanted to win at first.

554
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,299
But now,

555
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,210
I believe they're planning to do anything to destroy us.

556
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,250
I'm sorry, Mom.

557
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,090
Thing is

558
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,429
I've always thought the world was such a nasty place all along.

559
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,429
I've only looked at things from my perspective

560
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,120
so I've never noticed other people's problems before.

561
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm really sorry, Mom.

562
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,459
I needed time

563
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,090
and a lot of patience for this day.

564
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,289
To bargain with someone of power,

565
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,830
we need power ourselves.

566
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,569
But for Max's case,

567
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,179
whether he's to be proven right or wrong,

568
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,540
we need someone to help him out.

569
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,940
He's in danger.

570
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,079
Throw away the stuff you don't need.

571
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,720
We don't have that much space.

572
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,989
(I'll give up the house.)

573
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,640
(I don't think I'll be signing the contract anymore.)

574
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,380
Hello?

575
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
Top.

576
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,230
How are you doing?

577
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,919
Kul.

578
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Do you love me?

579
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,430
Of course, I do.

580
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,649
If you really love me,

581
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,509
you have to help me destroy Max.

582
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,239
I never want to see his face ever again.

583
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,549
Do we have to go to that length?

584
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,059
We can just throw him in jail.

585
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,679
That's not enough.

586
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,759
If I'm in pain,

587
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,759
he shall be in more pain than I do.

588
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,460
But that's...

589
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,119
But what?

590
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,809
You do what I say.

591
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,599
Do you think I don't have a video of you?

592
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,120
The one you were sleeping with me.

593
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,239
If you don't help me,

594
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,240
you're the one who'll also get in trouble.

595
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,999
From what happened,

596
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,969
the university's come to a conclusion to have you suspended

597
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,979
until the case is completely investigated.

598
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,930
Professor.

599
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:42,769
If I'm not guilty,

600
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,769
do I still have to lose years of my life?

601
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,560
I think the penalty you get is already very light.

602
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,329
(This is obviously intended murder.)

603
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,839
(What he did to Top is just too much.)

604
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,239
(Men can't be trusted. He seems quiet
but has got more anger than we think.)

605
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,780
(The penalty's too light. Maybe he's got a powerful backup.)

606
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,769
Luang Por.

607
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,439
What do I do?

608
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,439
If my future has to end this way,

609
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,439
how can I go on living?

610
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,979
Will anyone believe me

611
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,979
that what I did

612
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,980
was a self-defense?

613
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,889
Will there be any sacred being to save me?

614
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,890
Let it be.

615
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,280
We have to own up to what we did.

616
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,829
The problem is right in front of me.

617
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,649
How can I let it be?

618
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,259
If I don't fight,

619
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,329
I die.

620
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:11,589
That's the truth.

621
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,089
My world and yours are different.

622
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,929
We can't use the same solution.

623
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,439
Do you understand me?

624
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
I have a problem.

625
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,109
This minute,

626
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,019
I don't want anything else.

627
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
I just need someone

628
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,979
who would stand by my side.

629
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,539
Just that my only father, would embrace me,

630
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,539
would embrace me,

631
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,270
console me,

632
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,849
and tell me we'd get through this together.

633
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,520
But I can't even have that.

634
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,150
You've never been anything for me.

635
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,569
(This is the devil in human form.)

636
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,129
(He's like this at this age, what would he become when he grows up?)

637
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,130
(Why not just give him a death sentence?)

638
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,059
Yes, Top?

639
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,129
Have you met Max, your best friend?

640
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,499
No, I don't see him.

641
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,249
He probably wouldn't come back here anymore.

642
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,729
I'll look for him somewhere else.

643
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,729
Is that so?

644
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,480
It's fine.

645
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:37,539
If you don't see him,

646
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,449
my guys must have already seen him.

647
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,929
They're quite impatient.

648
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,149
Let go!

649
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,060
Hey!

650
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,780
Let go!

651
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:45,430
Stop kicking!

652
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,790
Let go!

653
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Let go of me!

654
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,829
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

655
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,499
Top wouldn't let Max slide.

656
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,309
He wanted me to help destroy Max.

657
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,220
But I didn't want to.

658
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,090
Stop the car!

659
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:53,599
But you're not fond of Max.

660
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,919
Why would you help him?

661
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,710
I'm not fond of him

662
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:58,050
doesn't mean I want him to die.

663
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,559
You're calling me a thief?

664
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,079
And when you're defending her,

665
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,740
how much do you think you know about her?

666
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,830
Had your share of fun?

667
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,169
It's nice to be you.

668
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,809
To be able to meet your family.

669
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,739
You have no idea what I did.

670
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,320
I made a lot of mistakes.
