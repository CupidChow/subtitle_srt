1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,489
Have you found the gun?

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,340
Where is it?

3
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:03,609
As you saw it.

4
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,119
Max took it.

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,640
What if he hurt someone someday?

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,640
For the worst, that person could be you.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,220
Kong.

8
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,580
Someone leaked a news

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,870
that you killed someone when you were younger.

10
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,659
They even posted that I had an abortion.

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,939
I think it's the reaction when they knew we've got the videos.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,109
Mom already exposed them with all the evidence,

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,250
but still, we can't accuse them of anything?

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,620
I knew it.

15
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:30,899
You really abused her.

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,850
Do you want to see it from another angle?

17
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,891
Let's watch the file she asked you to risk your life to get from this house.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,379
But you had no right to make up the story about violence

19
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,759
to get back at someone like this.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,909
Are you okay, Gut?

21
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,710
Where are you?

22
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,099
(Your brother is with me.)

23
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,740
(Keep this in mind.)

24
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,179
(If the clip gets leaked, )

25
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,359
(your brother will be gone forever.)

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,290
(Keep this in mind.)

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,619
Max, you asshole!

28
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,840
You're the cause of every bad thing

29
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:53,879
that happened to my life, aren't you?!

30
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,176
If you hadn't been such an asshole to me,

31
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,239
I wouldn't have done it.

32
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,369
You shithead!

33
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,649
How could you do this to me?!

34
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,420
Kul, stop.

35
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,360
There's only me

36
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,700
who can tell you what or what not to do.

37
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,770
You got that, Kul?

38
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Kong!

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,389
May!

40
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,670
This whole thing started because of me,

41
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,959
so I'll be the one to end it.

42
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,789
May!

43
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,579
May, wake up and talk to me!

44
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,700
May!

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,700

46
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,850
May!

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,139
- May, wake up. - Go and delete all the CCTV footage.

48
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,650
May.

49
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,859
Mr. Top, we have to go.

50
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,300
Come!

51
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,599
May, wake up.

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,259
May, wake up and talk to me.

53
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,449
May, wake up.

54
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,940
May!

55
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:53,439
May!

56
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,270
Hurry up!

57
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,670
May!

58
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,750
May, wake up.

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,110
May!

60
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,140
May!

61
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,200

You're almost in the doctor's care now.

72

Here.

00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,630
Your father's here to look over you too.

74
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,959
May!

75
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,490
Please wait outside.

76
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,429
Get lost, all of you.

77
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,659
Don't stick your nose in.

78
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,119
Calm down, Peem.

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,119
We all care about May.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,149
You care?

81
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,929
If you really cared,

82
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,789
things wouldn't have been this f**ked up.

83
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,809
Hey.

84
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,570
Hey!

85
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,619
Don't stick your nose in.

86
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Peem!

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,649
All of us here are sorry.

88
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,510
No one wanted this to happen.

89
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,269
It was an accident.

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,309
An accident?

91
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,099
Stop being so over-optimistic.

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,879
It's just like how you let your sister ruin our lives.

93
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,879
It wasn't an accident.

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,409
It happened because of carelessness.

95
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,409
Your sister couldn't even give May

96
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,209
a single word of apology.

97
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,990
Hey, Peem.

98
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,079
But that was Mink's business, not Pali's.

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,329
Honestly, even if you live under the same roof

100
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,539
it doesn't mean that you'd agree on everything.

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,649
On top of that,

102
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,719
Pali knows that and he's trying to take responsibility.

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,199
Don't try to act like a goddamn hero now.

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,229
Don't you forget that the reason why May's lying there suffering

105
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,779
is because of you.

106
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,529
You've been keeping the damn gun

107
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,199
but couldn't be responsible for it.

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,949
So everything's now f**ked up.

109
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,119
Hold on.

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,909
What's going on?

111
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,909
Why don't I know about any of this?

112
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,690
Hey.

113
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:59,289
Why are we blaming each other?

114
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,749
You'd better blame it on the culprit.

115
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,480
Top.

116
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,189
That bastard was the one who shot May.

117
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,189
The target was you, wasn't it?

118
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,379
I'm blaming you two.

119
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,379
What the hell have you guys done

120
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,949
that you'd go as far as taking each other's lives?

121
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,949
I was forced to.

122
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,039
He took my little brother.

123
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,649
What should I do if my brother was killed?

124
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,889
And I have to be your victim over and over?

125
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,659
Do I always have to be the one to blame?

126
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,789
Let me really ask you one thing.

127
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,789
Why do you always hate me?

128
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,149
Answer me.

129
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,400
Max.

130
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,659
Because I see myself in you.

131
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,199
I see the me I don't want to be.

132
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,049
I see the me who's a loser.

133
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,589
Then there's nothing wrong with me.

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,590
It's you.

135
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,989
Max!

136
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,079
Hey!

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
Stop.

138
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,299
Since things have escalated this much,

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,699
all of us must be responsible for this.

140
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,999
Especially May.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,099
If she doesn't have a gun in the first place,

142
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,189
this wouldn't have happened.

143
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,819
Even if May didn't have a gun,

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,019
it could have been anyone.

145
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,549
It's actually because of your greed.

146
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,779
Don't you think I wanted this?

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,829
When you have nothing,

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,189
you have no choice.

149
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,379
Don't you stick your nose in how I live my life.

150
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,949
Especially you who have no idea.

151
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,519
Especially you who don't have the right to say that.

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,439
Getting to know May just makes your life better.

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,329
In the end, you're no better than I am.

154
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,139
It's different.

155
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,480
Because I'm actually her friend.

156
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,730
And I don't expect anything from her like you do.

157
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,500
Hey!

158
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,309
Hey!

159
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,369
Hey!

160
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,029
Stop!

161
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,469
Stop acting like a mad dog.

162
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,689
It doesn't help make things better.

163
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,119
But let me do this for my mental.

164
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,329
I gave in to you too much already!

165
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:34,920
Hey!

166
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,700
Stop it.

167
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:36,839
We're friends!

168
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,830
Enough!

169
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,530
Ow!

170
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,479
Hey! Tam!

171
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,099
What kind of friends?!

172
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,549
People who met by chance

173
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,899
and treated each other like shit aren't friends!

174
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,639
But you have no right to hurt Tam too.

175
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,550
Hurt?

176
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,079
The one who was hurt is in there.

177
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,839
We don't even know if she's going to live.

178
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,279
What a waste.

179
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
That she fell for someone so stupid like you.

180
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,060
Okay.

181
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,949
If everyone wants to find who caused this whole thing,

182
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,249
I'm the one.

183
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,369
It was me who brought everyone together.

184
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,609
Do you know why?

185
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,609
Because I thought we all could be friends.

186
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,679
That we would love each other.

187
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,350
But if I can't make all of you love each other,

188
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,969
just go on and hate each other.

189
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,569
If you are just going to hate each other anyway,

190
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,189
then let me ask for one thing.

191
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,910
Don't you do any sh*tty thing like this again.

192
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,589
I don't care who you hate.

193
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,710
You must help my brother first.

194
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,739
(There were two gunshots at Miss Venus' press conference.)

195
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,230
(But the situation has escalated even worse than anyone could imagine.)

196
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,799
You betrayed me.

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,030
Yet you still have the guts to see me?

198
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,749
Tell me where Thachai's safehouse is.

199
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,039
One where he kept my friend's brother.

200
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,870
The kid has nothing to do with this.

201
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,180
You guys made it worse.

202
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,989
I told your mother many times before.

203
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,889
That she should end this.

204
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,399
But you still want to win.

205
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,390
Why do you think we would always give in?

206
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,019
Is it because you gave in,

207
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,759
so we should do the same?

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,660
Gun!

209
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,909
Are you willing to give up everything you have

210
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,730
just for what you want?

211
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,310
Even those who love you?

212
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,310
Dad.

213
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,899
I don't know why you do the things you did that we couldn't understand.

214
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Let's take a picture.

215
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,489
Kong.

216
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,879
Please take a picture for us.

217
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,019
From how you seem to hate me so much

218
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,400
to pretending I don't exist.

219
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,730
I'm envious of Gun to whom you taught everything.

220
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,139
I'm envious of Kanya whom you embrace.

221
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,819
But I'm the middle child

222
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,760
who never gets anything from you.

223
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
But still,

224
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,270
When I was younger, I've always wanted to be as brilliant as you are.

225
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,790
I just want to see you in that light again.

226
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,420
One where I see you as my hero.

227
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,829
He's here, sir.

228
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,190
Bring him in.

229
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,059
I only get to see you clearly today.

230
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,199
So this is him.

231
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,689
The middle child who brings misfortunes.

232
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,900
The one causing trouble endlessly.

233
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Just as your dad mentioned.

234
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Your dad traded this off.

235
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,700
So that you can still roam around freely.

236
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,689
And you want your stuff back

237
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,059
what have you got to bargain?

238
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,389
Huh?

239
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,560
I guess I only have my life left.

240
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,490
Is that good for a bargain?

241
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,419
You've got guts.

242
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,499
Had we met a little earlier, it would have been fun.

243
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,669
Your parents must be stressed out

244
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,669
having a child one like you.

245
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,830
I don't think I can beat your son on that.

246
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,559
He's got all your qualities.

247
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,430
He's good at spending money.

248
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,959
Good at exercising his power.

249
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Good at threatening others.

250
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,180
He's even good at taking pictures without consent.

251
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,959
Your dad still doesn't know you're secretly seeing my friend?

252
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,869
My friend gives in to everything you say.

253
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,539
Still, you threatened him and blackmailed him.

254
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,539
He shouldn't have fallen for you.

255
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,209
You said he's just a friend.

256
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,619
Is it because you're like this

257
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,819
that he becomes this way?

258
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,899
He's my son.

259
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,739
It's my business how I raise him.

260
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,920
Don't stick your nose in.

261
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,280
Top!

262
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,190
Hurry up!

263
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,890
Top.

264
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,309
You're actually not this kind of person.

265
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,019
But you're doing this just to please your father.

266
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,989
You just want him to love you, so you're willing to do anything?

267
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,739
Then what do you want me to do?

268
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,739
If you know it's wrong then stop.

269
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,129
It's not that hard.

270
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,130
Stop saying nonsense to my son.

271
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,930
If a dad wants to see his child's life ruined,

272
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,790
that's not love.

273
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,190
I've seen it before.

274
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,599
Why are you listening to him?

275
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,879
Get rid of him.

276
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,129
Show me

277
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,220
what a worthless one like you can bring to my table.

278
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,020
You're never worthless.

279
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,919
Hurry up and do it!

280
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,089
Get rid of him.

281
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,980
Shoot him.

282
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,559
Hurry up!

283
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,319
I'm freaking worthless, Dad!

284
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,569
I can't be the one you want me to be.

285
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,949
I can't do it.

286
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,079
Can you hear me? I can't do it.

287
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,459
I can't.

288
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,599
I can't take it anymore.

289
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,260
I really can't take it anymore.

290
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,969
Top!

291
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,319
Why did you do this, my son?

292
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,150
Top!

293
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,349
Top, my son.

294
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,409
Top!

295
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,729
Why did you do this?

296
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,789
You can't die.

297
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,370
You heard me?

298
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:32,979
This is my command, you must live.

299
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,639
Get up.

300
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,519
Top!

301
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,090
Get up.

302
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,599
Why did you do this, my son?

303
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,260
Freeze. This is the police.

304
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,890
Sit down.

305
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,090
Sit!

306
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,690
Mom.

307
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,820
Kong.

308
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
Top.

309
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,010
The patient's no longer in a critical condition.

310
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,129
I express my condolences for the loss of Mr. Thachai's only son.

311
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,899
It's something no one wants to see happening.

312
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:42,480
And it shows how important the family is to a child's development.

313
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,909
But at least, someone decided to make the situation better.

314
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,850
It's that Worawat turns himself in to the police.

315
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,779
He gave useful information and evidence about

316
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,329
the corruption in over 300 construction concession projects

317
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,229
that he and Thachai have long coordinated.

318
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,079
Including the involvement in all other semi-illegal businesses.

319
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,768
Furthermore, I've received the consent

320
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:11,359
of the victim to publicize the video

321
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
even though the counterparty has passed away.

322
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,279
I'm guilty of the violence incurred.

323
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,020
But I want everyone to see this video

324
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,160
because I want to speak my side of the truth.

325
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,439
It's better than doing nothing and taking the blame.

326
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,489
And so that the other victims who've been hurt by him

327
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,790
would be freed, mentally.

328
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,359
To no longer feel like you're the victim

329
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,540
who has to live in fear and keep quiet.

330
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,779
Just in case you would feel better after hearing this.

331
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,620
May is safe now.

332
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,219
Oh? Mom.

333
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,509
Kul.

334
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,570
Mom.

335
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,140
Gut!

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Come here.

337
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,610
Mom.

338
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,739
Excuse me for a second.

339
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,749
I'll be right back.

340
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,750
Sure.

341
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,929
It must have been tiring,

342
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,350
for you to become someone like me.

343
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,939
It's my mistake.

344
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,929
For letting someone like you influence my thoughts.

345
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,169
I used to want to win over you.

346
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,739
I actually still want to now.

347
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,479
But I won't use that method anymore.

348
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
I don't want to become someone like you.

349
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,190
Sure.

350
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,019
Mr. Good Guy.

351
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,570
Don't go running and crying to your mom again.

352
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,290
I wouldn't.

353
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,430
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,919
Actually,

355
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,009
your expensive clothes do look as worthless as trash when it's dirty.

356
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,009
Especially when it's worn by someone like you.

357
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,440
Here, here.

358
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,940
Oh?

359
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,210
Thank you.

360
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,969
Oh? Max.

361
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,499
You're back?

362
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,059
I saw you in the news, you were so cool.

363
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,559
I barely got out alive.

364
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,300
How was that cool?

365
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,669
It's cool that you didn't give up.

366
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,440
You know what?

367
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:32,710
You're now my idol.

368
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,369
By the way, no one's chasing after you now, right?

369
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,929
I think it's ended.

370
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,360
No more.

371
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,800
Hey.

372
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,839
Let's stop doing this.

373
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,659
What are you doing, Max?

374
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,720
Hey.

375
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,430
Max.

376
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,610
Don't let anyone catch you again.

377
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,960
Have you guys seen Luang Por?

378
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Where did he go?

379
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,740
I guess he decided to leave me too.

380
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,840
I won't leave you.

381
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,499
(The table's turned! Max's actually the victim.) (be freed, mentally.)

382
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,599
(To no longer feel like you're the victim)

383
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,229
(who has to live in fear and keep quiet.)

384
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,170
At least all these crappy things ended.

385
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,080
Now there's only you left.

386
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,380
Guess what just woke up.

387
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
The answer is

388
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,750
me.

389
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,060
Bastard.

390
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,650
You're crying like a baby.

391
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,309
You're really something.

392
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,799
When you said you were going to say goodbye to the others,

393
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,910
it sounded like something bad was going to happen, you know?

394
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,779
I really didn't want to be here.

395
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,500
There's nothing here that can make me feel good anymore.

396
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,460
Would you like to come with me?

397
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,499
You can come live with me in the countryside if you want.

398
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,499
I have nothing against that.

399
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,100
So we can sell this house.

400
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,099
It's fine, Dad.

401
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,409
But.

402
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,629
Is it okay if I live in that house alone until I graduate?

403
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,629
Do you want to live there alone?

404
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,630
How will you live?

405
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:19,009
Actually, it has always felt like living alone.

406
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,350
Nothing's barely changed.

407
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,550
Don't worry.

408
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,869
My mom and I are taking care of Tam.

409
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,559
There's nothing to worry about.

410
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,449
So that everyone can live the life they want

411
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,660
and we don't owe each other any favors.

412
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,530
We're home, Grandma.

413
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,070
Tam.

414
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,670
I'm sorry for not having told you so many things.

415
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,860
A lot of things I do cause trouble for others.

416
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,039
Don't be upset.

417
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,039
I'm not upset.

418
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,979
And I don't think it's your fault.

419
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm just sorry something like that happened.

420
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
I'm sorry too.

421
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,830
But can I ask for something?

422
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,999
Yeah.

423
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,019
Sure.

424
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,020
From now on, I want you to trust in me.

425
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,899
We can take it slow.

426
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,530
And you can see whether I live up to my words.

427
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,370
Let's try.

428
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,800
Let's try it out together.

429
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,010
Are you hungry?

430
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,279
I've never tried this before.

431
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,790
Will it be edible?

432
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,829
There, there, Mr. Kong the rich guy.

433
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,829
It's just cutting up vegetables.

434
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,829
What 'rich guy'?

435
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,830
I'm just a nobody.

436
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,290
But I'm glad that we have each other like this.

437
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,929
You don't have to worry about anything anymore.

438
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,839
My mom said she would look after you too.

439
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,890
While I will take care of you the best I can.

440
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,870
Why are you smiling?

441
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,469
I've always thought that if I were to have a boyfriend,

442
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,469
I would like something vigorous.

443
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,030
I want to feel excited all the time.

444
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,589
But that's nothing compared to this.

445
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,109
How is it right now?

446
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,160
I have a peace of mind.

447
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,430
You know what?

448
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,669
The only good thing that happened to me this year

449
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,810
is probably meeting you.

450
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,230
May's not here anymore.

451
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,739
(Whether you want to know or not, )

452
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,470
(my condition's better now.)

453
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,589
(I've caused a lot of problems in the past.)

454
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,098
(Many of which might have made it hard for us)

455
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,690
(to look at each other the same way.)

456
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,207
(I'll probably go somewhere far away)

457
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:42,299
(and might never see you guys again.)

458
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,279
(If this were to be the last time we talk, )

459
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,089
(the only word I may say is)

460
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,410
(I'm sorry.)

461
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,079
Do you really want me to go?

462
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,610
I do.

463
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,960
Hmm?

464
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:31,769
I don't mean it like that.

465
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,979
I asked you what you think.

466
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,109
And you said it's a good opportunity.

467
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,110
I thought so too.

468
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,159
When you love someone,

469
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,020
you would want to support them in living the life they want.

470
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,850
You're saying something like an adult.

471
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,029
I got it from your Mom.

472
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,279
Are you guys close now?

473
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,689
Of course.

474
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,900
I might steal your place as her favorite child.

475
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
There.

476
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,749
Use this to keep yourself warm over there.

477
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,529
I will make sure to call you every day.

478
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,359
Until you don't want me to.

479
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,580
Are you afraid that I might change my mind?

480
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,449
It's not that.

481
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,510
I just want you to live your life.

482
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,739
If you don't feel the same way

483
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,749
or if you find something that changes your mind,

484
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,460
you can let me know.

485
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,309
You too.

486
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,310
Live your life.

487
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,560
For our relationship, let's try our best for now.

488
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,860
Let's take a family photo.

489
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,139
Kong.

490
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,190
Come and take a photo together.

491
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,290
Come.

492
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,909
Ready?

493
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,910
1... 2...

494
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,689
See you, Kanya.

495
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,230
Bye!

496
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,279
It seems like your smile is back.

497
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,029
Well.

498
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,480
The girls were into me and now you do too?

499
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,490
I'm good-looking, is it?

500
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,619
Bastard.

501
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,789
Are you catching feelings?

502
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,789
Stop blabbering.

503
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,240
What are you going to do next?

504
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,989
By the way, Mom gave me this place.

505
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,180
She says I can do anything as long as I don't cause trouble.

506
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,149
How's your mom doing?

507
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,819
She seems fine.

508
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,229
She and Prof. Jate are running her campaign.

509
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,980
They seem happy being together.

510
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,449
I just found out that they used to date.

511
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,849
They broke up because my mom had to marry my dad.

512
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,249
Do you think my Grandma and Grandpa in heaven would realize

513
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,039
that forcing my Mom to marry would have resulted

514
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:09,259
in such a messy situation?

515
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,519
If they still have feelings for each other and get back together,

516
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,199
then it's up to them.

517
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,770
I want her to be happy too.

518
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,279
Your Mom really cares a lot about others.

519
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,089
When she heard about my family,

520
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,670
she sent a doctor to see my Mom and Mink.

521
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,669
Her emotional situation has to be mended

522
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,259
so she won't cause trouble to anyone anymore.

523
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,700
Including herself.

524
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,909
By the way, Peem texted me.

525
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,809
He said Mink and Karn called him and May to apologize.

526
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,359
May wanted to just get it over with so she held no grudge.

527
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,749
As long as they don't do that to anyone else ever again.

528
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,230
Yeah. He probably doesn't want to talk to me.

529
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,959
I think you should give him some time.

530
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,169
Peem is with May now,

531
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,879
he's going to drop out for a month and go somewhere far.

532
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,450
He'd probably gather his thoughts and come back soon.

533
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,389
May wants to go to the States.

534
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,119
She will meet her Mom once and find something to do there.

535
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,580
She said here's not the place for her.

536
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,479
By the way, I happen to run into Kul.

537
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,690
Here.

538
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,380
I can now tell you guys what I went through

539
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,770
without being embarrassed about it. (Always rooting for you.)

540
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,949
(Life goes on, Kul.)

541
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,899
He said he wanted to try something new.

542
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,899
He actually finds it a pity to leave his old job.

543
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,409
It sure did pay well.

544
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,729
There are so many things we should be aware of.

545
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,029
Especially people.

546
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,449
I don't think he did anything wrong in the past.

547
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,699
But he just wants to take a break.

548
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,177
He doesn't want to take himself

549
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:47,139
into a circle where nothing's predictable.

550
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,959
He said he told his family everything.

551
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,630
They were sad to hear it but they came to terms with it.

552
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,450
I think someone like Kul would make a good influencer.

553
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,600
People are willing to love him.

554
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,699
Although he starts off by talking about his mistakes.

555
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,419
But he doesn't care, really.

556
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,889
Those who slander him don't help him pay for his house.

557
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,679
They don't give him money to use.

558
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,709
There's no reason for him to live up to other people's opinions.

559
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,619
It's true what he says.

560
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,330
That's so Kul.

561
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,199
What about Max?

562
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,600
He moved out of the temple.

563
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,029
My mom said he's renting an apartment.

564
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,079
Gun helped find a job for his dad so they'd have income.

565
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,330
Is it tiring, Dad?

566
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,620
For the study, my Mom's still sponsoring him.

567
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,230
What about you?

568
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,030
Me?

569
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,930
I...

570
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,339
I want to do my best.

571
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,940
So I won't regret it later.

572
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,199
I will take care of Tam.

573
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,659
If I happen to marry Tam, you have to be my best man.

574
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,829
Ew.

575
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,200
No.

576
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,109
Why not?

577
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,290
What's wrong with that?

578
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,690
Are you jealous?

579
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,109
Jealous my butt.

580
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,369
Are you out of your mind?

581
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,630
I and Tam are friends now.

582
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,809
Seriously, though.

583
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,459
Honestly speaking.

584
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,829
Whenever I think of this.

585
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,829
It pisses me off.

586
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,659
There, there.

587
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,289
Please don't be upset.

588
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,450
Bastard.

589
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,839
Why would you be mad at me?

590
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,229
We only have each other.

591
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,030
Do you still want to be mad at me?

592
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,239
You're right.

593
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,880
There are just two of us left.

594
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,540
I shouldn't have said those harsh words.

595
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,209
Hey.

596
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,869
Don't overthink it.

597
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,870
You did your best.

598
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,460
By the way, Kong.

599
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,200
If you had the choice,

600
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,080
would you have let all these things happen?

601
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,180
I would.

602
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,199
At least, all the things we went through

603
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,220
changed us from who we were when we first walked into this place.

604
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,280
Everyone grew up in their own way.

605
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,620
(May left the group.)

606
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,362
(Peem left the group.)

607
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:58,118
(Kul left the group.)

608
00:36:58,143 --> 00:36:58,815
(Max left the group.)

609
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,802
(Tam left the group.)

610
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,989
Who knows?

611
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,930
In 5 or ten years' time, when we're older

612
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,410
we might see all these as mere small problems.

613
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,840
We might become friends again.

614
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
May.

615
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,280
Sup.

616
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:30,769
We might meet here again.

617
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,369
And I would get to apologize to everyone myself

618
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,800
when everyone's ready to hear it from me.

619
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,329
That's a pop!

620
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,630
Welcome to the club!

621
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,149
But for now, there's only me and you.

622
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,339
Shall we start over nicely?

623
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,339
Where to start?

624
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,009
Let's start at

625
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,869
me and you going running to fulfill the vow.

626
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,870
One where you don't cheat.

627
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,020
Fine.

628
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,959
Bring it on.

629
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,850
Yeah, let's go.

630
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,270
Let's go.

631
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
("We will not leave anyone behind." - Venus)

632
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:07,130
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

633
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,130
Hold on, hold on.

634
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,549
What did you do to me?

635
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,920
You actually started it.

636
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,199
If she goes out with someone younger...

637
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,180
I'm fine with that.

638
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,579
They're 15 years apart.

639
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,870
What?

640
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,429
I think at this age,

641
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,580
finding someone on par would seem more appropriate.

642
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,309
No matter how much I like you,

643
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,669
you're 15 years younger than I am.

644
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,670
Finally, you admit it.

645
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,099
Do you believe in love at first sight?

646
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,629
When you fall for someone at first glance,

647
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,770
and you know he's the one.
