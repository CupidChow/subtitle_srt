1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,389
What if I accidentally say I want a car?

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,850
You got it.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,179
He seems rich,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,539
but he really looks down on others.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,909
I feel I don't belong there at all.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,909
But can you do something for me?

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,489
From today, I turn you into someone

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,360
who won't feel embarrassed about that anymore.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,729
That's it.

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,850
Am I still a kind person to you?

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,180
Pali.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,399
Because I don't sleep with you,

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,579
you sleep with someone else?

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,920
Tam!

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,089
You promised you wouldn't hurt Tam, didn't you?

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,969
If you still can't move on about Kanya

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,149
and can't start a new relationship,

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,810
just don't do it.

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,479
Pali, let's fight on this together one more time.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,189
I make up my mind already.

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,700
I won't let Mom control my life anymore.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,610
Dad.

23
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,470
(I trust in you that you're good on your own.)

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,499
(A kind person like you will be adored by everyone.)

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,120
(Just like the way I love you.)

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,589
Dad.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,139
Dad!

28
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,759
Dad.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,010
Wake up, Dad.

30
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,690
Wake up, Dad.

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,799
Wake up, Dad.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,039
Dad!

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,819
Wake up, Dad.

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,019
Dad!

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,460
Wake up, Dad.

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,069
(Do you want to come to America to live with me and your siblings?)

37
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,549
It's fine, Mom.

38
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,049
I made up my mind from the beginning that I would stay here.

39
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,370
(How can a girl live alone by herself?)

40
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,949
People can live alone regardless of gender.

41
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,489
You wouldn't care about me even if I was there.

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,659
I'd rather stay here and pretend that you miss me.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,069
(So you're planning to spend your money.)

44
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,790
(You sure know how to have fun with them.)

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,109
Whatever.

46
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,369
If you think money is the only thing that can make me happy,

47
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,769
I'll just stay until this money runs out.

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,290
And I'll have even more fun than you imagine.

(Kong: Let's grab something to eat.)

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,179
(How do you like it?)

60
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,569
(Sex.)

61
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,389
(Let's meet outside.)

62
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,570
(Tell me your size as well.)

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,050
Which shoe is the hardest to find?

64
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,989
You can't go unless you give me the correct answer.

65
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,390
Stop it.

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,889
The answer is

67
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,890
a lost shoe.

68
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,459
But it's here.

69
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I got it cleaned for you.

70
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,430
Hold on.

71
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,479
Where are you going?

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,129
You're my roommate

73
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,469
not my boyfriend.

74
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,710
Leave yourself out of my business sometimes.

75
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,879
You have so many secrets.

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,249
Do whatever you want.

77
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,249
Just keep yourself out of trouble.

78
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,950
I care about you.

79
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,910
Fine.

80
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,780
Bye Bye!

81
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,520
Is this your safe house?

82
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,080
I was going to have a chat over some beer first.

83
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,269
So I wouldn't seem too eager for sex.

84
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,499
Why bother talking?

85
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,219
Don't waste my time.

86
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,219
We don't want to know each other anyway.

87
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,799
You must be very good at relationships.

88
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,469
Not at all.

89
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,639
I don't even know what love is.

90
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,639
But I believe that sex is better.

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,499
Because you can actually feel it

92
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,960
and climax from it.

93
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,100
It's much more tangible than love.

94
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,870
May.

95
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,119
I'm leaving.

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Why the rush?

97
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,260
Here.

98
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,079
You think I'm selling my body?

99
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,889
Do you have to devalue me like this?

100
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,179
Devalue?

101
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,829
How is giving money devaluing?

102
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,279
For me,

103
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,369
money is the best way to say thank you.

104
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,080
Is it not so for others?

105
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,999
You...

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,129
What makes you become this way?

107
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,199
But it's good.

108
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,199
I've never met someone like you before.

109
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,379
I like it.

110
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Can I have your Instagram?

111
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,929
Then...

112
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,059
Is it okay if I want us to meet again?

113
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,630
I don't want you to be gone after tonight.

114
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,329
Are you seeing anyone?

115
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,799
I don't want any trouble.

116
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,119
I was married once.

117
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,149
But we broke it off.

118
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,150
Are you sure it's off?

119
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,250
I'm Karn.

120
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,430
May.

121
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,880
He still didn't agree to clear things up with you?

122
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,270
I called, but he didn't pick up.

123
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,289
He didn't reply to my messages either.

124
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,859
And now he's skipping classes.

125
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,349
I don't know what to do now.

126
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,310
It seems like

127
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,489
I'm in the wrong.

128
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,040
And I'm the one to ask for his forgiveness.

129
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,119
The thing you saw that day.

130
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,940
What do you think?

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,670
Does it seem like a misunderstanding?

132
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,540
What did I misunderstand, then?

133
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,559
What I saw was...

134
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:13,649
a girl with her clothes undone

135
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,949
and

136
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,520
she was on top of Pali.

137
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,069
Then, I'll excuse myself.

138
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,809
It might be better for girls to talk.

139
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,009
You stay.

140
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,659
It happened because of a man.

141
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,070
How can you leave it for girls to talk it out?

142
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,569
I wouldn't be this sad.

143
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,499
If Pali didn't tell me

144
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,619
that he would cut ties with all others,

145
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,100
that he wouldn't have anyone else,

146
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,640
and I happened to really believe in it.

147
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,600
You like him a lot, don't you?

148
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,720
That's why it hurts you this much.

149
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,219
If you can't think of any solution,

150
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,399
then just don't.

151
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,399
Go home and rest.

152
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'll help you figure it out.

153
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,400
Thank you guys so much.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Without friends like you guys,

155
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
I would be in bad shape.

156
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,829
Then.

157
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,830
I'll get going.

158
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,880
She shouldn't have met someone like this.

159
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,659
Pali is being too much this time.

160
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,659
Let me ask you frankly.

161
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,809
Are you mad because of what Pali did to Tam?

162
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,420
Or does it bother you that there's a crack in their relationship?

163
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,080
And now.

164
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,700
Kong might approach Tam.

165
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,789
Maybe you should leave some room for disappointment

166
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,790
so that you wouldn't be too badly hurt.

167
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,380
Who's that?

168
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,940
Mink?

169
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,790
Why are you here?

170
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,829
When did you arrive?

171
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,829
Can you not mess with me now?

172
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,439
Since when did you start caring about my whereabouts?

173
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,989
You can just answer me.

174
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,500
Fine.

175
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:24,499
If Mom or anyone else asked,

176
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,680
don't say you saw me here.

177
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,390
What the heck?

178
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,990
Nice.

179
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,729
We've got a good-looking singer.

180
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,400
Girls are flocking in.

181
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,259
If I really helped draw people into your place,

182
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,339
then I'm glad.

183
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,479
Then you would have me here for a long time.

184
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,160
Well, as long as that person's willing to cover your pay.

185
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,520
My pay?

186
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,149
You can send in song requests.

187
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,119
Whichever song you want to hear.

188
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,259
Or you can ask for something else.

189
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,890
I like catering to people.

190
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,570
Thank you.

191
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,480
Is "SOS" the name of a song or is it a cry for help?

192
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,539
Hello.

193
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,649
We're lucky.

194
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,099
My dad's not here today.

195
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,219
And I'm glad

196
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,960
that our time matches.

197
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,600
I can always make time for you.

198
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,649
Who could give you this much, Kul?

199
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,189
This makes me lose face.

200
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,189
She's just putting the down payment for me.

201
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,689
I have to pay for the rest.

202
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,769
That's why you come to me, right?

203
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,089
That's not it.

204
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,090
I miss you indeed.

205
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,870
I will make up for how much you miss me.

206
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,180
Why did you invite me over today?

207
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,419
Play some games with me.

208
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,699
But let me give you a heads-up.

209
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,140
I'm really good at this game.

210
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,970
Shall we?

211
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,399
Sure.

212
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
I'll give you a demo.

213
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,229
How was that?

214
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,399
Scored right from the first one.

215
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,209
Damn.

216
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,400
Let's have more of that.

217
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,090
Damn!

218
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,560
Scored again.

219
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,769
You try it.

220
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,119
Try.

221
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,849
This way, right?

222
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,309
Yeah.

223
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,630
Watch me.

224
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,940
Watch me.

225
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,120
Just you look.

226
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,080
Scored again.

227
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Damn.

228
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,500
You suck at this.

229
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,290
Why aren't you scoring?

230
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,289
I'll show you.

231
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,539
There we go again.

232
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,920
Look.

233
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,959
I do realize that ever since the project was launched,

234
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,299
there has been a range of responses.

235
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,829
The best person to speak on behalf of the project is probably not me,

236
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,579
but the representative of Youth Club.

237
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,730
He's one of the voices never heard by others before.

238
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,829
Hello.

239
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,229
The reason why I decided to join the Youth Club

240
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,279
is because I see the opportunity that no one ever gave to me.

241
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,999
It's the opportunity for fair access to education.

242
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,129
I've seen many friends ask for loans to pay their tuition fees.

243
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,259
I've always wondered why opportunity comes with a price to pay.

244
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,079
But Youth Club offered me help.

245
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,469
And I believe

246
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,370
that many people here would be given a good opportunity, just like I did.

247
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,579
In addition to the intriguing news,

248
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,299
rumor has it

249
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,979
that you're using this project as a stepping stone to your political career.

250
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,460
Is that true, Mrs. Venus?

251
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,539
I'm glad for the chance to speak up on this today.

252
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,479
So that I can speak out the truth.

253
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,819
First of all,

254
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,139
it's not true that I'm using this project as a stepping stone.

255
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,849
And what's certain and I would like to confirm is that,

256
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm actually deciding to pursue the political path.

257
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,539
Kong.

258
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Yeah?

259
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,909
Can I have a word?

260
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,820
What's up?

261
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,269
Well...

262
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,119
Are you angry with me that I joined your mom's project?

263
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,969
Why would I?

264
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,349
It's a good life opportunity for you.

265
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,200
Please don't hate me.

266
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,780
I'm afraid that I wouldn't be worthy enough to be your friend.

267
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,500
Max.

268
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,499
I've never thought that way.

269
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,499
I'm just worried about you.

270
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,229
Anyways, just make sure she's not using you.

271
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,639
Rest assured.

272
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,260
I'm always on your team.

273
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
Cool.

274
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,589
Max.

275
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,089
Why are you taking so many pictures?

276
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,069
Kong just had the CCTV removed.

277
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,070
Protect our safe house's secret.

278
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,409
Nothing.

279
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,419
I'm just snapping for fun.

280
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,700
An old building like this is quite pretty.

281
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,710
Let's head upstairs.

282
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,020
Chill.

283
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,799
I pretty much have some ideas in my head.

284
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,919
I have been doing some research

285
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,399
and think of a theme that could fit.

286
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,699
I want the theme to be something like this.

287
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,279
Playing some unwinding music.

288
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,479
So that the ambiance would be chill.

289
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,489
I don't want there to be any pressure that we must have fun.

290
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,270
More like,

291
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:38,349
you can join us if you come alone,

292
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,150
or have fun if you come in a group.

293
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,729
Who's going to pay for this?

294
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,550
I'll pay it in advance first.

295
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,159
I'll sell drinks on the day.

296
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,359
Once we get the money,

297
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,460
we cover the cost with that.

298
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,239
If you're going to take it that seriously.

299
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,529
Why don't we sell entrance tickets?

300
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,849
So it would be profitable.

301
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,430
Would people come if you have to pay for it?

302
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,779
There are lots of rich people out there.

303
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,289
This is no temple event where you get to eat for free.

304
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,210
Don't worry.

305
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:04,979
I'll get people coming.

306
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,940
By the way.

307
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,609
If the event is on Saturday

308
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,129
I'd be free that day.

309
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,009
I can take care of the music and singing.

310
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,319
If you guys enjoy my singing.

311
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,869
Go ahead.

312
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,729
Feel free to do whatever you want.

313
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,670
Just enjoy.

314
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,439
I can't really do much.

315
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,369
I'll just do the investing part.

316
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,529
And

317
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,530
I'll help Kong with anything.

318
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,779
What about you, Max?

319
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,859
Are you not planning to help anyone?

320
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,410
Or are you just planning to take free stuff home again?

321
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,999
I told Kong before.

322
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,929
I'd always be on his team.

323
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,639
I can help with anything.

324
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,249
I will help with serving the food.

325
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,769
Help cleaning.

326
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,319
I can help with anything.

327
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,669
I'm good with hard work.

328
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,670
Not just a talker like you.

329
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,719
What's the matter with you guys?

330
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,420
I'm not even sure anymore

331
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,799
whether you guys are just teasing

332
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,440
or if you guys really do hate each other.

333
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,270
You're no joke.

334
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,540
It's a gift from my family.

335
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,809
Is it going to be just us who do this?

336
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,560
Aren't Tam and Pali helping out?

337
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,080
Well.

338
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,279
I'll get them to join us.

339
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,129
I think it's time we talk.

340
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,510
Otherwise, it's going to keep being awkward.

341
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,590
Damn!

342
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,929
Don't tell me Tam and Pali used this place already.

343
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,029
I don't think they fought over any other issues.

344
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,249
I think they fought because of this.

345
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,919
It doesn't matter who had sex with whom.

346
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
As long as they use a condom.

347
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,240
What's wrong with you?

348
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,449
You suddenly froze.

349
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,349
Nothing.

350
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm just...

351
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,099
I'm just thinking.

352
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,249
If we're going to hold this event,

353
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,589
and we're collecting an entrance fee,

354
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,819
then we should make it a good one.

355
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,399
Let's set a theme.

356
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
So our event would have that gimmick.

357
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,800
Sounds fun.

358
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,609
Then let's do that.

359
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,610
I'll leave it to you, Kong.

360
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,390
(Kong: Let's grab something to eat.)

361
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,149
This next song will be my last song.

362
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,960
I'll see you again.

363
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,449
(No rhyme or reason, our paths crossed)

364
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:19,229
(Is it chance, fate, or a coin we tossed?)

365
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,049
(I don't know who it was that drove)

366
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:32,050
(Two lonely hearts to meet and fall in love)

367
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,559
(In this love we hold so dear)

368
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,819
(What is this force that pulls us near?)

369
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,620
(It is a question that's still unclear)

370
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,560
Hello.

371
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,919
We've met again.

372
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,079
You remembered?

373
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,469
I do.

374
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,470
I've actually wanted to see you for days.

375
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,100
But you wouldn't show up.

376
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,740
You like to miss strangers, don't you?

377
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,259
Um...

378
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,259
That note you sent me.

379
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,359
What does it mean?

380
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,469
If it's really a song's name,

381
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,290
perhaps it's just me who doesn't know it.

382
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,420
What do you think?

383
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,430
Are you okay?

384
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
Anything I can help with?

385
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,730
Did anybody hurt you?

386
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,659
You can tell me about it whenever you're ready.

387
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,320
If you want anything, just hit me up.

388
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,999
Then, I'll excuse myself.

389
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,459
So you can rest.

390
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Hold on, Peem.

391
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Can you help me with something?

392
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,550
Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?

393
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,979
I don't want to be alone.

394
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,530
I'm scared.

395
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,919
Why do you have so many bruises?

396
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,200
What exactly have you been through?

397
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,989
Let's go to the police.

398
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,700
Don't worry.

399
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,080
I'll go with you.

400
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,079
I told the police before.

401
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,200
But there's no use.

402
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,269
But I have my way of dealing with it.

403
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,270
I just need someone's help.

404
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,340
It'd be great if you're down to help me.

405
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,049
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

406
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,449
You don't have to do this, really.

407
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,939
We can meet somewhere else.

408
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,389
Being alone in a room like this.

409
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,589
Wouldn't seem so appropriate.

410
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,589
It would seem inappropriate

411
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,899
if others witnessed it.

412
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,249
But here,

413
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,619
no one can see us.

414
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,220
May.

415
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,399
I just want to spend time with you

416
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,509
when hearing something important.

417
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,839
Hear about what?

418
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,260
About what I asked you before.

419
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,560
Are you not going to give me an answer?

420
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,569
I'm just asking for you.

421
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,410
To give me a chance.

422
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,100
Do you think it's really impossible?

423
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,670
I...

424
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,080
I like Tam.

425
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,549
Even when Tam likes Pali.

426
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,550
Your best friend?

427
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,310
I wasn't expecting anything, May.

428
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,359
If it goes well for those two,

429
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,759
I would just be here.

430
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,720
I just want to be true to my feelings.

431
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,330
Why did you bring this?

432
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,290
What were you planning to do?

433
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,309
I wasn't going to do anything.

434
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,249
Then where did you get this from?

435
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,389
Why do you carry it around?

436
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,090
Don't you know how dangerous it is?

437
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,869
Do you even care about what I'm up to?

438
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,440
Can't we have a proper conversation?

439
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,530
Let me ask you frankly,

440
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,800
what were you doing at the police station on that day I met you?

441
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,379
To get this gun back.

442
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Back from what?

443
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,380
Back from what?

444
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,550
This gun is the evidence in my dad's case.

445
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,469
Which ended without any problem.

446
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,979
So I went to get it back.

447
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,479
And why do you carry it around?

448
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,129
What for?

449
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,930
Do you know how dangerous it is?

450
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,490
Kong.

451
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,610
My dad died because of this gun.

452
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,879
I just get it back and keep it.

453
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,149
To represent the only person who's on my side.

454
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,970
Is it wrong?

455
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,240
How can someone like you

456
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:35,110
understand how it feels to have no one love you?

457
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,200
May.

458
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,239
I want you to believe in one thing.

459
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,989
You're not alone in this world.

460
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,620
You still have me as a friend.

461
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,390
And this friendship

462
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,240
will make us love each other forever.

463
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,260
A friend.

464
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,530
A friend.

465
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,909
I want my gun back, Kong.

466
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,999
I really can't give you that.

467
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,869
I will keep this gun.

468
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,329
It's too dangerous when it's with you.

469
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,270
Kong.

470
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,260
May.

471
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:25,540
It's my dad's gun, Kong.

472
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,059
(Are you going to spend all your money tonight?)

473
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,059
It'd be great if it's all spent.

474
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,660
I want it all to be gone too.

475
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,810
You seem to enjoy spending money.

476
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,489
If you're this spendy,

477
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,569
how about spending some on me?

478
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,339
I have a side job.

479
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,340
I can do anything.

480
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,669
Don't stick your nose into my business.

481
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,890
And I don't fancy you.

482
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,509
KARN

483
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,690
Where did all your friends go?

484
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,429
Friends?

485
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,319
I don't quite have friends.

486
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,729
I only have trouble.

487
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,509
This guy?

488
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,279
Pali?

489
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,700
He needs to figure his life out first.

490
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,979
You know what?

491
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,479
I can do some fortune-telling.

492
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,879
From your looks,

493
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,339
Anybody can tell that your life is full of trouble.

494
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,639
But if you want me to look further ahead,

495
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,210
I can tell it would be a hundred times more hectic.

496
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,170
What the hell are you doing?

497
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,949
Huh?

498
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,889
I'm cleaning.

499
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,419
I'm living under your roof

500
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,420
so I should help out, right?

501
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,480
May!

502
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,970
What the hell?

503
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,639
Calm down.

504
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't throw a tantrum just yet.

505
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,329
You told me yourself

506
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,589
that we'd stay out of each other's business.

507
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,019
One more thing,

508
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,359
we're not in a relationship.

509
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,549
We shouldn't be fighting over this.

510
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,549
I understand about your private life.

511
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,360
I don't mean to stick my nose into it.

512
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:06,969
But this is my place.

513
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,119
You can't just bring anyone to live here.

514
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,029
Why don't you two move out together?

515
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,350
I think I'm being too kind.

516
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,650
Fine.

517
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,989
I'm sorry.

518
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,539
But listen to me,

519
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,819
Mink was abused by her ex-husband.

520
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,789
And the man's after her right now.

521
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,459
It's this big of a deal.

522
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,109
Do you want me to just let it slide?

523
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,910
And you believe her from just hearing that?

524
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,620
Mink is Pali's older sister.

525
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,340
What?

526
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,469
Yeah.

527
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,129
It's a big deal at the moment.

528
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,599
And she can't let her family know about it.

529
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Otherwise, everyone will be in danger.

530
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,210
Do you know who Mink's troublesome husband is?

531
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,339
Well.

532
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,809
She sent me a picture.

533
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,409
You should have a look too.

534
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,410
So we can stay alert.

535
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,480
Here.

536
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,299
I don't want you to be gone after tonight.

537
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,630
I've never met someone like you before.

538
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,150
Is it okay if I want us to meet again?

539
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,840
I'm Karn.

540
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,739
Are you seeing anyone?

541
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,660
I was married once.

542
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:28,689
But we broke it off.

543
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,689
Nice to meet you.

544
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,040
What's wrong?

545
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,439
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

546
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,169
Do whatever it takes.

547
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,179
Make Tam and Pali get back together.

548
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,769
Why do you care about Tam and Pali?

549
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,039
If I'm not happy,

550
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,820
Then I don't want anyone to be happy.

551
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,229
You should talk it out with Tam at Kong's party.

552
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,229
So you wouldn't have to face Tam alone.

553
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,679
I'll help you today.

554
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,039
This thing has to end.

555
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,879
And it has to end with you being happy.

556
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,579
I want to start again.

557
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,229
With you.

558
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,549
Pali.

559
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,049
What are you doing here, Kanya?

560
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,189
I want to tell you in person.

561
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,410
That I will get back together with Pali.

562
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,979
Did you mess with my money, Yam?!

563
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,329
I'm giving you three days.

564
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,929
If you don't come up with money to repay me,

565
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,099
You're in trouble.

566
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,489
I've seen that you like to spend money without thinking.

567
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,839
And I'm someone who can do anything for money.

568
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,419
Why are you here?

569
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,169
People here don't have fun the way we do.

570
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,889
You guys have a dress code.

571
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,019
A thief boss and the minion twins.

572
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,609
Where's my watch?

573
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,450
Where's my watch?

574
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:05,920
Kul!

575
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,219
Just because I'm poor so I seem to be the bad guy.

576
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,840
Is that it?
