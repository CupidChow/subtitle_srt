1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,639
What on earth are you doing?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,400
Are you stealing?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,839
Thanks for letting me live with you.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,839
I can tell even when I was on stage.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,599
You almost ate Kong up alive.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,969
Just keep going.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,200
I'll help you.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,550
Kanya!

9
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,559
Maybe this is how we're supposed to part.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,179
Why don't we get to know each other better?

11
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,399
Tam and I have decided.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,060
We're going to try learning more about each other.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,419
Why does it have to be Tam?

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,129
I'm scared you would be a jerk to Tam.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,560
Like how you did to other girls.

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,919
But if you break Tam's heart this time,

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,750
I'm not going to let it slide.

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,240
Come on, Mom.

19
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,749
I swept the floor

20
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,189
and filled up water bottles already.

21
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,890
Why do you want me to do so many things?

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,399
Will you be away for many days?

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,210
(After making merit, )

24
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,399
(I'll drive your grandma home)

25
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,629
(and stay overnight there.)

26
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,300
What?

27
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,669
You told me you'd hurry back, didn't you?

28
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,299
You left me here.

29
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,299
Mink and Pan always got to go with you.

30
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,889
Whenever a boy comes, he gets noisy.

31
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,049
(Stay there.)

32
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,049
(Buy your dad some food.)

33
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,589
He's not usually home.

34
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,589
(Well, go see him now.)

35
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,390
(Let him know you're home.)

36
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,899
Okay.

37
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,609
I'll tell him later.

38
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,580
(Later again?)

39
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:09,609
(Go now.)

40
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,770
(You keep saying this.)

41
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,240
(You won't do it in the end.)

42
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,010
Fine.

43
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,549
Mom, turn on your camera

44
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,370
so you will stop nagging.

45
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:17,819
Let's get it over with, okay?

46
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,510
Look.

47
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,880
Dad, show your face to assure Mom you're really here.

48
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,289
(How could you do this to me?!)

49
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,290
(You asshole!)

50
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,229
You scumbag child!

51
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,029
You have always been a jinx since you were born.

52
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,119
You'll see.

53
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,840
One day, your life will be f*cked up like mine!

Hey, take it.

00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,460
Thanks.

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,119
Tam gave it to me.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,099
Tam and I have decided.

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,290
We're going to try learning more about each other.

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,500
Kong, if you want to date someone,

68
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,660
can I be one of your choices?

69
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,400
What makes you clean the house late at night?

70
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,810
What made you came downstairs and saw me?

71
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,169
I'm hungry.

72
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,510
We don't have any food today.

73
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,550
Here it is.

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,779
Oh, I see.

75
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,269
You're her dearest kid.

76
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,269
Of course, there must be special food for you.

77
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,210
Why?

78
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,209
What did you argue with Mom about this time?

79
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,619
I forgot you two are always arguing.

80
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,360
Or you must be heartbroken.

81
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,119
I was guessing randomly but I was right.

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,829
Do you want to vent?

83
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,289
To your mind, what makes people like each other?

84
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,839
What a tricky question.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,299
You're the one who should give me some advice on that.

86
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,169
I asked

87
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,449
because I know you once liked him that much.

88
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:53,609
So, I want to know if everyone likes someone like Pali.

89
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,610
Someone fell for him?

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,789
Nope.

91
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,500
I was giving an example.

92
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,529
Hey, if you eat this much,

93
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,699
you'll get fat.

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,619
You said you didn't want to get fat, didn't you?

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,490
Just tell me if you want to eat some.

96
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,810
Wait.

97
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,720
You're putting it too much.

98
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,720
It totally ruins the taste.

99
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,269
Eat.

100
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,299
Open your mouth now

101
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,110
before it drops.

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,210
That's why I enjoy eating it.

103
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,789
People won't know if we're really bearing spiciness

104
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,550
or actually crying.

105
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,810
Well,

106
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,860
Pali asked me to return the bracelet to you.

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,939
But if you don't want to see it,

108
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,430
let me know.

109
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,240
I'll throw it away.

110
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,589
It's alright.

111
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,970
Please put it in my room.

112
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
You're getting fat.

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
This way, please, Luang Por.

114
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,779
I remember Mom told me she wanted to eat pizza.

115
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,179
Enjoy it in heaven, Mom.

116
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:58,180
(blessing)

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,879
Max, you have to practice today, right?

118
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
Be patient and work hard.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,499
I hope you can get the important opportunity.

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,930
I'll do my best, Luang Por.

121
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,049
The 8th place goes to Mr. Worawat Ruengwattanakit,

122
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,820
the business owner of a famous real estate company. (10 Richest Business Owners in Thailand.)

123
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,609
Why isn't Top's family included?

124
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,399
I think they're even richer than No.1.

125
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,169
They only rank business owners.

126
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,070
A politician doesn't count.

127
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:35,549
Kong's mom is becoming a politician, too, isn't she?

128
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,670
Do you think it's possible for her to even beat Top's dad?

129
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,380
Hello, Senior Top.

130
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,440
Hello.

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,439
Nobody taught you

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
how a junior must treat me?

133
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,489
I'm Max, first-year.

134
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,949
All of us here are professionals.

135
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,629
I'm serious about it, too.

136
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,310
I want to be a national-level athlete.

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,419
National level?

138
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,659
Then, your first goal is to bring me down.

139
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,380
That's already difficult enough.

140
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,660
What are you guys doing, huh?

141
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,019
Help me warm up.

142
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,240
Sure.

143
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,579
Would you like to do some stretching first?

144
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,669
Why did you even ask?

145
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,999
It's your duty.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,129
Sure.

147
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,560
I'll do that for you.

148
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,170
Hey, Kul?

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,820
You know him?

150
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,449
I know you must feel tired,

151
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,649
so I bought something for you to eat.

152
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,019
Come on, Kul, our dearest bro.

153
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,329
You came to work on time.

154
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,459
You know well I don't think of it as work.

155
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,210
I'm doing this with my heart.

156
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,969
Thanks.

157
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,900
Let me keep it for you.

158
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,309
The picture frame is used to tell a story about what's in it.

159
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,940
What we can see is what you intend to present.

160
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,390
What can you see in my frame?

161
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,719
Value, perhaps.

162
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,769
Your outfit, watch, shoes, and car key

163
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,350
altogether cost several millions.

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
How about your frame?

165
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,019
Professor, we call him a third wheel.

166
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,390
Kong is sitting between a couple.

167
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Mr. Kong, what do you think?

168
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,540
This frame is handsome and warm-hearted.

169
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,490
We'd better call him untrustworthy.

170
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,749
That isn't wrong

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,829
because what's inside the frame is

172
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,829
what we choose to reveal to others.

173
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,269
People won't know other related stories about it

174
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,119
that make the truth not always being told.

175
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,070
This could be similar to how you view me, Mr.Kong.

176
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,489
Hey, I'll go to our club this evening.

177
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,490
Join me if you're free.

178
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,800
Do you want to come with me now?

179
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm not going.

180
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,479
I'm not free today.

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,019
Hey.

182
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
But let me see your watch.

183
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,719
Wow.

184
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,979
Stunning.

185
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,380
Can I take a photo?

186
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,420
(I've finished my class. Where should I go?)

187
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,439
Happy Birthday!

188
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,099
Surprise!

189
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
That's your present.

190
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,629
What are you guys playing?

191
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,010
Stop pretending, okay?

192
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,340
Go ahead.

193
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,540
Show us what you've got.

194
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,219
Happy Birthday, Dream.

195
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,820
I'll give you the best service tonight.

196
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,520
Why haven't we met before?

197
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,809
Your schedule is tight, right?

198
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,569
Not at all.

199
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,289
Others aren't that interested in someone like me.

200
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,989
Come on.

201
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,140
Who wouldn't be interested in the top tier like you?

202
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,140
What?

203
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,860
Why?

204
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,759
Hello.

205
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,999
Yam, that client can't touch me like that.

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,029
Why are you suddenly becoming reserved, huh?

207
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm not.

208
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,100
But if she wants to go this far,

209
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,569
I can't accept this rate.

210
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,989
Don't tell me they paid the full amount,

211
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,219
but you took a lot of commission and left me with so little?

212
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,349
Stop. I'll handle it for you.

213
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,739
How?

214
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,440
The only acceptable way for me is to see the transfer slip.

215
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,560
(10,000 THB successfully transferred to your account)

216
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,799
I like it if you're this nice.

217
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,669
I don't like someone so mindful about skinship

218
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,499
because when I spend money,

219
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,230
I'm never mindful.

220
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,159
How kind you are, Dream.

221
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,810
If a person like me likes someone,

222
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,809
I can give him everything.

223
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,020
What if I happen to say I want a car?

224
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,600
You'll get it.

225
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,949
These days, many young people can afford to buy cars.

226
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,409
They make good money.

227
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,959
Luckily, I'm hard-working.

228
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,409
How talented you are.

229
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,049
You can afford to pay this high monthly installment.

230
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,769
I bet you're earning a high income.

231
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,079
Here you are.

232
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,560
Give me a second.

233
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,539
Hello, everyone.

234
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
Now, we're looking at

235
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,359
my new car.

236
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,680
Stay tuned for the next clip

237
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,759
to see where I'll take you on a trip with this new car.

238
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,759
It's as much as 300 THB?

239
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,509
Can you give me a discount?

240
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,399
Just think of it as joining me in making merit.

241
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,729
I can't.

242
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,269
These are large fish.

243
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,490
They give you as much merit as their sizes.

244
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,779
Is that so?

245
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,449
Auntie, do you know that

246
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,699
if you do meritable things for a twin,

247
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,799
your good deed will be doubled?

248
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,609
That's true.

249
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,069
Many of our previous customers came back here to thank us.

250
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,399
Alright. I'll take it.

251
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,300
Thank you.

252
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,549
Is that dude in your gang, too?

253
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,339
He looks so damn rich.

254
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,589
Should we just release all the fish we caught?

255
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,839
To have a good life in our next life, you know.

256
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,239
Thank you.

257
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,239
Asshole.

258
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,319
If we had hoped for merit,

259
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,319
we wouldn't have caught them to sell in the first place.

260
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,439
It's money that matters.

261
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,439
If we can earn, we'll have a good life in this life.

262
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,759
He seems rich,

263
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,759
but he really looks down on others.

264
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,469
May and Kong look rich,

265
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,189
but they aren't behaving like that.

266
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,979
By the way, you stayed overnight at their place.

267
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,419
Did you take any of their stuff?

268
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
What the hell are you talking about?

269
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,390
What?

270
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:11,269
I'm not a thief.

271
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,499
I stayed overnight

272
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,110
because I just wanted to sleep in a room with air conditioning.

273
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,789
Damn.

274
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,469
I had such a comfy sleep and felt as if I hadn't slept for many years.

275
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,239
Will you go there again today?

276
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,519
I think I won't go there anymore.

277
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,330
What?

278
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:30,140
I'm too different from them. I don't belong there at all.

279
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,939
Just forget about it.

280
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,259
I'll work hard and earn money to pay the tuition fee.

281
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
As you wish.

282
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,899
(Youth Club is ready to provide you with education funds.)

283
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,200
(Just submit your application for this project.)

284
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,159
Is that Kong's mom?

285
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,969
They're one of the richest families on the rank.

286
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,599
I think

287
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,029
if her son could only give you pizza,

288
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,169
you'd better rely on her instead.

289
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,449
Trust me.

290
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,759
There's an influencer flaunting his riches, right?

291
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,599
You'd better show off your poverty.

292
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,249
That's a new type, you know.

293
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,249
Then, join this project

294
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,479
and ask to be funded.

295
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,089
(Youth Club goes all out, )

296
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:17,915
(providing the funds to support talented teens.)

297
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,540
I guess they will like you.

298
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,000
True.

299
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,269
You're already living a dog's life.

300
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,890
To the max.

301
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,889
They probably like you a lot.

302
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,889
He's thinking about it.

303
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,380
He's thinking hard.

304
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,049
Will you really allow me to do anything I want?

305
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,129
Of course.

306
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,639
I'll do as I said.

307
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,309
Can you tell me already what you're taking me to do?

308
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,409
You'll find out soon.

309
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,459
Will I hit something?

310
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,920
You won't.

311
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,470
A few steps more.

312
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,400
You're almost there.

313
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,909
A few steps more.

314
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,499
We've arrived.

315
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,340
Peekaboo.

316
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,099
I have wanted to do this for so long.

317
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,579
Okay. Sure.

318
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,919
Who will ride first?

319
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,620
I want to ride pillion.

320
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,719
Here.

321
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,890
This is a popular photo spot people post on IG.

322
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,770
Stand here.

323
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:27,069
I want that fountain in the photo, too.

324
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,159
Smile.

325
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,099
One, two.

326
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,900
One more.

327
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:32,909
Smile.

328
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,910
One, two.

329
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,449
You aren't enjoying it, right?

330
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,179
It's not like that.

331
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,629
It's just that I haven't done something like this often.

332
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,309
But you aren't enjoying it, right?

333
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,099
Come on, Tam.

334
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,219
Let's be frank with each other.

335
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,189
I don't want us to not tell each other

336
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,769
if there's something we don't enjoy doing together.

337
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,560
It could turn into a long-term problem.

338
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,779
Honestly, this activity isn't bad at all.

339
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,919
It's just that I'm tired.

340
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,579
Going on a date doesn't mean

341
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,409
we have to create a romantic scene.

342
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,869
Just being together

343
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,359
and living our lives as usual can be adorable

344
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
and make us happy already.

345
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,039
I think I expected something too dreamlike.

346
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,779
I'm probably too into those IG posts.

347
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,969
Don't worry.

348
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,970
Just forget about it.

349
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,029
From knowing him,

350
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,569
what kind of person do you think Pali is?

351
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,789
He seems to enjoy freedom

352
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,789
and loves himself a lot.

353
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,419
Can someone who loves himself so much

354
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,759
really love someone else?

355
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,229
Hey. Don't be demanding yet.

356
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,819
If you want to go ahead,

357
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,429
you should try giving him love first.

358
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,289
How about this?

359
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,609
Take me to do what you enjoy doing.

360
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,870
I also want to get into your world, Pali.

361
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,640
This is my regular table.

362
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,000
I miss you.

363
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,689
This is Tam.

364
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,170
Your friend?

365
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,809
We're in talking stage.

366
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,410
I forgot that you're good at talking.

367
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,100
Well, let me order some food.

368
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,070
Go ahead.

369
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,709
I'm not disturbing you anyway.

370
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,360
Would you like your regular order?

371
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,769
How did you two get to know each other?

372
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,490
At which party?

373
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,430
We go to the same university.

374
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,250
Did you make the first move?

375
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,850
I'm just asking, you know.

376
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,259
I don't usually see Pali hitting on someone seriously.

377
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,499
Have you ever counted how many?

378
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,569
As many as 100?

379
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,979
Why do we have to talk about this, Aeko?

380
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,899
Can I just stay with her alone?

381
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,399
I took her here.

382
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,079
Are you guys on a date?

383
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,849
But you chose your regular place?

384
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,529
How could you not meet someone you know here, Pali?

385
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,209
If we count how many,

386
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,659
I guess that number can make a Chinese dinner.

387
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,989
I'll go back now.

388
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,990
My grandma called.

389
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,000
Tam.

390
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,729
There's really nothing in it.

391
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,449
I already cleared things up with them.

392
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,889
I just wanted to show I'm honest with you, letting you know everything,

393
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,189
but I didn't expect she would bug us this much.

394
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,969
Or else, I wouldn't dare to take you here, Tam.

395
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,970
Be honest with me.

396
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,309
What kind of person are you, Pali?

397
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,309
Are you a playboy?

398
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,540
How many girls have you met?

399
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,920
Am I here to be a funny one?

400
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,290
But can you give it a try?

401
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,539
Try trusting me

402
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,190
that I'm not like that anymore.

403
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,430
Tam,

404
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,099
we've talked about this already

405
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,350
that we'll keep trying together.

406
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,379
I admit

407
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,739
that I'm sensitive about something like this.

408
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm not strong enough to handle things.

409
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,420
I can go back myself, actually.

410
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,560
I told you we'd stay together today.

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,960
I definitely won't break the promise.

412
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,259
Before you go home,

413
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,340
do you want to chill out at my place first?

414
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,980
Let's not do that now.

415
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,870
I want to take it slow.

416
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,630
Sure.

417
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,910
Tam, don't worry at all.

418
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,459
I really understand you.

419
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,550
I want to make sure you're really okay with it.

420
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,370
Tam.

421
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,860
Tam.

422
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,649
(You weren't being yourself at all.)

423
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,489
(Let's meet if you're lonely.)

424
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,080
(You know I know well what you like.)

425
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,740
Are you surprised to see me?

426
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,349
I didn't think anyone would come here.

427
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,869
It seems nobody is that interested in it.

428
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,870
I'm interested.

429
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,549
I bought some food for you.

430
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,810
I don't want to eat alone.

431
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,259
Is the light bulb too loose?

432
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,200
I'll try fixing it.

433
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,119
Hey, let me do it.

434
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,380
But even I can't reach it, May.

435
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,580
Of course, I will

436
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,580
if you help me.

437
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,499
Why are you so surprised?

438
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,110
Carry me so I can reach it.

439
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,589
It's this easy.

440
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,170
Am I still a kind person to you?

441
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,380
I have something to consult with you.

442
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,019
I want this relationship to last.

443
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,129
Can you give me some advice?

444
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,289
Honestly, Pali has been hurt because of love so many times.

445
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,479
I think he himself still can't handle some issues that properly.

446
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,829
He seems like someone in error.

447
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,649
Just make everything simple, as Pali told you.

448
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,509
Just live your lives together.

449
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,819
Actually,

450
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,819
though Pali enjoys hanging out,

451
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,819
he's actually a homebody.

452
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,099
If there's no errand,

453
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,849
he buries himself in his room all the time.

454
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,020
(Pali) He says his bedroom is his safe zone.

455
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,019
So he invited me to his place

456
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,949
because he wanted to take me to his safe zone, right?

457
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,449
He's a lot more sensitive than we think

458
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,080
though he looks like such a playboy.

459
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,550
Pali.

460
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,470
Tam!

461
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,849
Tam!

462
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,979
Tam, I didn't do anything.

463
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,589
She came herself

464
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,980
and tried to do everything.

465
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,569
Now that I saw everything,

466
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,839
you're still denying it?

467
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Pali, why?

468
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,920
Just because I don't sleep with you,

469
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,310
you slept with someone else?

470
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,419
Tam.

471
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,189
There's really nothing between that girl and me.

472
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,859
As I told you, I rejected her.

473
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,339
She's angry,

474
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,989
so she's trying to approach me.

475
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,729
She's trying to do everything to get me back.

476
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,239
But that will never happen.

477
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,709
I ended everything already.

478
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,959
What if I didn't come today?

479
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,810
Would you tell me about it?

480
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,100
It's because I don't have anything to tell.

481
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,190
What's the point of arguing?

482
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:54,100
I told you already to be frank with me.

483
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,149
Even if the more I say, the more things get screwed up?

484
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,910
Do we have to go that far?

485
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,340
Tam.

486
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,150
What shit did you do again?

487
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,429
If you want to curse me, do that later.

488
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,609
Help me first.

489
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,900
(I screwed it up again.)

490
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,750
Are you surprised

491
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,970
I returned earlier than expected?

492
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,229
Not really.

493
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,640
You always do something I can't predict, don't you?

494
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,199
It's good we're all here.

495
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,240
I told Kanya I have something to talk to her about.

496
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,199
What is it, Mom?

497
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,240
I'll send you to study in the USA.

498
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,939
Your mom is so good at planning life, you know,

499
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,339
whether it be about work or her kids.

500
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,059
Without her,

501
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,570
I would end up in trouble for sure.

502
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Thank you so much for trusting me.

503
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,569
As for your study in the USA,

504
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,219
you can go this month.

505
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,440
You don't have to wait until you finish high school.

506
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,170
You promised you wouldn't hurt Tam, didn't you?

507
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,330
I can't erase the mistakes I made in the past.

508
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,629
You know, I made a lot.

509
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:51,880
I don't know if there will be any other problem that will hurt Tam.

510
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,859
How will you take responsibility for her feelings?

511
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,589
Think, okay?

512
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,590
Pull yourself together.

513
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,820
If you still can't move on about Kanya

514
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,670
and aren't ready to start a new relationship, just don't do it.

515
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,059
Be decisive, okay?

516
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,780
Nobody deserves to be a victim of your sensitive emotions anymore.

517
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,670
Your alcohol level exceeds the limit.

518
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,410
It's you again, as always.

519
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,790
Did you call someone to bail you out?

520
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,890
(Mink)

521
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,790
Don't be angry with me, Kanya.

522
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,380
Kanya.

523
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,540
Pali,

524
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,489
I've made up my mind already.

525
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,960
I won't let Mom control my life anymore.

526
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,230
Let's go through this together one more time.

527
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,669
Tomorrow morning, I'll hurry to the court.

528
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,129
Don't worry.

529
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,630
What about us?

530
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,450
Can we really get back together, Kanya?

531
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,959
If the problem we had back then doesn't count,

532
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,539
we still love each other.

533
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,350
Do we?

534
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,600
I have to clear up something about myself first.

535
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,209
I don't know how much time we have left

536
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,209
about us.

537
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,809
If you're thinking about doing something,

538
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,510
do it real soon.

539
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,890
(Tam: I'm ready to talk now.)

540
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,239
Hello, Mr. Kanin.

541
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,819
Today, we'll discuss finding a representative to present about Youth Club.

542
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,199
We need someone with a clear image.

543
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,199
Or else Youth Club won't yet be recognized widely.

544
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,440
Yes.

545
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,199
Mrs. Venus!

546
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,319
You aren't allowed inside.

547
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,929
Please book an appointment queue in advance.

548
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,049
But I'm Kong's friend.

549
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,609
Are you his friend at the university?

550
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,240
Yes.

551
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,529
May I ask

552
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,929
if you were also at the event that night?

553
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,310
Yes.

554
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,749
Well, I want to apply for funding.

555
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,929
I'm a swimmer

556
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,270
but haven't got any medal from any big competition as a guarantee yet.

557
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,069
If you really want to be funded,

558
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,549
a medal is a must.

559
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,579
Or else we can't find a reason for funding you.

560
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,580
The committee could object to it.

561
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,820
Can being poor be a reason?

562
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,699
Do I have to only be talented to get support

563
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,440
and opportunities?

564
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,059
It's alright.

565
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,389
I understand.

566
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,889
I'm bringing a Buddhist amulet as a gift for you.

567
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,310
I hope sacred power will protect someone generous like you.

568
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,079
May I ask

569
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,189
if you know all of Kong's friends?

570
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,549
I do,

571
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,129
but I think I won't join them anymore

572
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,879
because I'm too different from them.

573
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,740
I feel embarrassed.

574
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,450
I think I can help you with the funds,

575
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,240
but can you do something for me?

576
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,279
Go back there,

577
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,839
be friends with Kong and other members.

578
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,069
Just keep me updated on everything going on there.

579
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,809
From today, I'll make you someone

580
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,830
who won't feel embarrassed about that anymore.

581
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,819
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

582
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,089
I've seen many friends ask for loans to pay their tuition fees.

583
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,470
But Youth Club offered me help.

584
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,879
Are you angry with me

585
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,159
that I joined your mom's project?

586
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,079
Just make sure she's not using you.

587
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,899
He still didn't agree to clear things up with you?

588
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,479
I called, but he didn't pick up.

589
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,029
He didn't reply to my messages either.

590
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,680
I don't know what to do now.

591
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,049
You like him a lot, don't you?

592
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,339
That's why it hurts you this much.

593
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,609
Who's that?

594
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,530
Mink?

595
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:14,689
Can you not mess with me now?

596
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,849
Who could give you this much, Kul?

597
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,849
This makes me lose face.

598
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,399
If you're this spendy,

599
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,079
how about spending some on me?

600
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,199
I can do anything.

601
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,499
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

602
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,729
May.

603
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,159
We've met again.

604
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,569
You like to miss strangers, don't you?

605
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,349
Can you help me now?

606
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,400
I don't want to be alone anymore.

607
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,719
What the hell?

608
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,519
Mink got abused by her ex-husband.

609
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,980
Do you know who Mink's troublesome husband is?
