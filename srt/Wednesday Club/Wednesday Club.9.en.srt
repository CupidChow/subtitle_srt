1
00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:03,930
We might have to postpone the publicity of Mrs. Venus' candidacy.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,370
Our parents parted ways long ago.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,580
They meet occasionally

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,500
to maintain their social status.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,420
I know that you're going through a lot on your own.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,420
Even though I can't help,

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,290
I'm rooting for you.

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,630
I and Kanya want to help you out,

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,810
so we did some research.

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,810
I think we should let Mink come back and stay here.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,690
Karn doesn't know this place.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,640
And on that day,

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,390
I'll be the one to lure Karn out of the house.

14
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,580
Then you go get the stuff.

15
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,850
I don't find it fun anymore.

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,320
Hey!

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,060
Still!

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,280
There you go.

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,100
You never cared about your sister.

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,160
Don't stick your nose in.

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,030
Mink.

22
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,220
Come out, let's talk.

23
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,190
Guys.

24
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,500
Mink's gone.

25
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
My dad's bracelets are gone, too.

26
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,020
Have we ever been here before, Gun?

27
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,720
Of course, we have.

28
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,130
Is there anything I can do to make you hate me less?

29
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,570
Mom!

30
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,880
(Copter!)

31
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,910
What's going on, Mom?

32
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,640
It's like I was the reason someone fell down the stairs.

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,370
Ever since what happened to Kong,

34
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,770
Dad decided to go on another path entirely.

35
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,960
He doesn't care about anything but money.

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,540
I'll make sure he has no presence.

37
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,120
The problem is right in front of me.

38
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,650
How can I let it be?

39
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,500
I don't want anything else.

40
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,650
Just that my only father, the only one I have left.

41
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,790
You have to help me destroy Max.

42
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,520
If I'm in pain,

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,500
he shall be in more pain than I do.

44
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,370
Let go!

45
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,630
If you don't help me,

46
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,430
you're the one who'll also get in trouble.

47
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,770
I told you to shut up!

48
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,100
If I can ask for one thing,

49
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll ask for another world

50
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,050
where everything is different from now.

51
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,110
Make some noise!

52
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,330
Would May be happy like this

53
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,330
if her parents didn't leave her that day?

54
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,870
What if Peem's feeling of guilt didn't last inside of him?

55
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,120
And what if he wasn't a victim of anyone,

56
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,330
that got him involved in something dangerous to his life?

57
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,837
What if Kul wasn't hurt because he was looked down on?

58
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,597
And what if his academic performance was as excellent

59
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,180
as it should have been?

60
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,300
What if nobody in Max's family passed away

61
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,160
and his family remained normal?

62
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,946
Hey, keep it down.

63
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,657
(Kanya)

64
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,960
What if there wasn't a problem between Pali and Kanya,

65
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,000
and their relationship lasted long as the first love worth remembering?

66
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,631
And what if Tam

67
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:22,414
could really live a normal life happily with her own family?

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,080
If I had such magic,

69
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,840
I would change everything into a happy story.

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,990
But I can't.

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,690
I can't even change my own story.

Where is she sitting?

82
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,210
Mom.

83
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,010
This is not too risky, is it?

84
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,320
Don't worry.

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,430
I've decided.

86
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
It might hurt a bit,

87
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,630
but we must end this thing,

88
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,680
so our family won't be living with this torture anymore.

89
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,530
If we decide to go ahead,

90
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,830
we can't step back.

91
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,250
Regarding the affair you're rumored to be involved in,

92
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
what's the truth?

93
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,910
The guy on the news has been my friend for a long time.

94
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,990
He's always with me when I face problems.

95
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,990
In the recent accident,

96
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,500
he was also unfortunately injured

97
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,660
while, in fact, my ex-husband intended to hurt me only.

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,420
He intended to hurt you?

99
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,750
That's right.

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,830
Worawat and I have been divorced for two years already.

101
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,930
We got married because of our families' businesses.

102
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,140
They used us to connect their businesses.

103
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,270
But after the mission was completed,

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,960
it seemed everything had ended.

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,330
You mentioned that Mr. Worawat planned the accident

106
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,630
because he was displeased about your male friend.

107
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,630
That's not the reason.

108
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,010
He did it because he knows

109
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,180
I have all the documents and evidence  that can expose him.

110
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,440
I've got these documents and other pieces of evidence.

111
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:00,183
These documents are related to the company,

112
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,640
which has been open for only two years

113
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,010
to be the nominee for receiving various construction budgets.

114
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,470
The owner of this company is Worawat, my ex-husband.

115
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,260
He closely serves Thachai.

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,470
This nominee company I'm talking about runs several forms of b

117
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,310
(Business Documents)

118
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,820
These include construction work concession projects,

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,270
bars allowing underage teens in,

120
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,520
casinos,

121
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,560
and illegal online casinos.

122
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,190
He's not only hurting our family,

123
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,520
but he's destroying everyone and every family.

124
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,730
I think everyone should enjoy following up on this news

125
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,140
more than paying attention to the made-up affair.

126
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,400
Please let us take your family photo.

127
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,110
Hello.

128
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,870
Hello.

129
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,870
Thank you.

130
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,620
Thank you so much.

131
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,330
Thank you.

132
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,660
Were you hurt much?

133
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,530
Receiving such great support,

134
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,620
I feel alright now.

135
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,910
You must punish the one who did this.

136
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,550
Yes.

137
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,430
Anyway, please support my dad.

138
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,550
I won't change my mind

139
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,270
I'll vote for him.

140
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,460
Based on the recent report,

141
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,710
Mrs. Venus revealed the corruption you're involved in.

142
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,790
What's your response to this, Mr. Thachai?

143
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,700
I don't know yet in detail how she talked about me.

144
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,940
Anyway, I would like to confirm that

145
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm not involved in any form of corruption or illegal actions.

146
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,020
Now, I'm having my legal team look into this to see if

147
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,870
what she said is considered an allegation or defamation.

148
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,390
How about Mr. Worawat?

149
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,350
She claimed that he's involved.

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,350
Why would you listen to a woman like Venus?

151
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,500
She keeps talking nonsense and randomly accusing me.

152
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,000
I insist that Mr.Worawat and I don't know each other personally.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,860
Let them fix their own family problems.

154
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,080
I have nothing to do with this.

155
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,980
Please excuse me.

156
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,570
Mr.Thachai!

157
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,050
Excuse me.

158
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,650
Mr. Thachai!

159
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,440
Sir!

160
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,650
(How have you handled Max so far?)

161
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,780
Stop the car!

162
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,870
I told you to stop the car!

163
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,140
Hey, don't move.

164
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,010
Stop the car now!

165
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Don't follow me.

166
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,390
How the hell could just one woman ruin things

167
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,840
and screw us up this much?

168
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Handle this for me quickly.

169
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,890
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,570
How about that boy under Venus's care?

171
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,300
Have you handled him already?

172
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,298
(We're in trouble now.)

173
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,934
(Max already ran away.)

174
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,480
Yes, Dad.

175
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,310
There's no problem at all.

176
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,690
Don't cause any problems again.

177
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,690
We have so many problems already.

178
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,110
If I have to go on solving problems for you,

179
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,490
I won't let you live, Top.

180
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,580
Yes, Dad.

181
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,470
We found no record.

182
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,470
After her recent checkout,

183
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,740
we didn't see her here again.

184
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,800
Did you see her pass by at all?

185
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
I didn't.

186
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,260
Why are you stopping me?

187
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,480
Why are you protecting her?

188
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,900
She won't return to a place Karn knows, will she?

189
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,610
I think she must be facing a problem.

190
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,930
She's already got the evidence.

191
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,030
I don't know if she's in any danger now.

192
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,100
What kind of person in danger would steal my stuff, huh?

193
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,800
Those are my dad's last items I'm keeping.

194
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,570
Have you gone too far?

195
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,930
You're calling her a thief?

196
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,780
Hey!

197
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,580
And when you're defending her,

198
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,750
how much do you think you know about her?

199
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,160
Let's go back to someone who knows her well then.

200
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,350
Okay?

201
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,520
Why didn't she pick up my call?

202
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,440
(Just forget about it.)

203
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,280
(Don't meddle with your sister's business.)

204
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,900
(I'll handle this myself.)

205
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,920
How is it going?

206
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Have you found that troublemaker yet?

207
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,350
Mink doesn't talk to me either.

208
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,520
Do you think she loves me that much?

209
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
And will you just wait without any clue?

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,740
How can you feel at ease, huh?

211
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,450
Hey, Peem.

212
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,070
Stop thinking that I'm not trying when it comes to my sister's issue.

213
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,360
Damn it.

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,570
I shouldn't have trusted anyone so much that I let them move in.

215
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,300
Are you talking about me?

216
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,680
If you think you're part of this fault,

217
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
then yes.

218
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,850
Don't worry.

219
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,590
I'll move all my stuff out of your room today.

220
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't argue now, okay?

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,490
I won't blame anyone

222
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,510
if I haven't found out the truth.

223
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,350
I'll deal with this problem about Mink myself.

224
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,630
Hey, Peem.

225
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,220
Where are you running away to again?

226
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm not.

227
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,190
I have an errand.

228
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,800
What errand?

229
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,290
You're hiding so many secrets, aren't you?

230
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,210
Why do I only meet brats in my life?

231
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,420
Come with me then.

232
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,840
I don't want to get involved in your exciting action scenes anymore.

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,700
Don't talk too much.

234
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,490
If you're this curious, follow me.

235
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,340
Bro, have you picked it up for me?

236
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,830
Or else my mom would hit me.

237
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,800
Give me a second.

238
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,260
I'm doing it.

239
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,040
Here.

240
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,380
What?

241
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,850
You didn't even say goodbye.

242
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,250
Ouch!

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,670
I think I should have been the one propping you up.

244
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,520
Oh.

245
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,320
Sure.

246
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,780
Come on.

247
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,000
You've been through a lot on your own,

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,870
but you still want to keep helping others.

249
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,870
I'm probably afraid I won't get to heaven after I die.

250
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,990
Why do you want to get there?

251
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,330
Is there anyone you know up there?

252
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,550
Hey, what's wrong?

253
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,550
I got scratched by the tree a bit.

254
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
I'll dress the wound for you.

255
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,100
Mikasa will heal you.

256
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,240
Wait.

257
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,730
Is this the name of this plaster?

258
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,960
Yeah. Can't it be?

259
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,860
Of course, it can.

260
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,340
Honestly, I'm happy to see you smile again.

261
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,760
I don't know what to do anymore.

262
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,430
All I have to do now is to get over it.

263
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,160
How about you?

264
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,880
Are you okay?

265
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,630
Of course.

266
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,420
I have the energy you gave me.

267
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,210
Hey, you're still keeping it?

268
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,020
How could I throw away this important item?

269
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,070
I know I can't help you,

270
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,620
but no matter what,

271
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,420
I'm here for you.

272
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,120
Thank you.

273
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,190
You know what?

274
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,590
Since I found out about my family's issue,

275
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,590
I came to realize that

276
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,770
life is always unpredictable.

277
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,780
If there's anything that can make your tangible happiness,

278
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,810
you'd better grab it.

279
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,510
Don't worry.

280
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,630
Things could be better.

281
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:46,110
Also, hurry up and do what you want to,

282
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,080
so you won't regret it later.

283
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,420
Well then,

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,670
I won't be afraid anymore.

285
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,100
Oh, Aren.

286
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,040
Pali and Kanya did some more research

287
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,160
and found that your biological mom works here.

288
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,970
But we don't have recent photos of your mom at all,

289
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,580
so I don't know if it's really true.

290
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
Don't worry.

291
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,820
If I see her with my own eyes,

292
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,980
I think I will know right away.

293
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,620
Finally, this day has come.

294
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,470
Grandmom praised me that

295
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,610
I'm gifted in cooking.

296
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,380
I probably got it from my mom.

297
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,270
Do you want to go talk to her now?

298
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,780
Not yet.

299
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,450
Not today.

300
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,310
I want to go back and prepare something first.

301
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,560
Hello?

302
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,150
What's wrong?

303
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,150
Why did you want to see me?

304
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,290
Well, I don't know how to explain this,

305
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,590
but Max will get in more trouble.

306
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,040
What do you mean?

307
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,350
Top wouldn't let Max slide.

308
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,790
He wanted me to help destroy Max.

309
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,690
But I didn't want to.

310
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,690
But you're not fond of Max.

311
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,860
Why would you help him?

312
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,690
I'm not fond of him,

313
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,070
but that doesn't mean I want him to die.

314
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Why did you make me come here with you?

315
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,130
Do you think I have so much free time

316
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,430
that I can chill out at a shopping mall?

317
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,340
I'm meeting up with someone.

318
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,000
It's good you're coming with me.

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's my important appointment today.

320
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,400
Peem!

321
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,710
Phum.

322
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,570
I missed you...a lot.

323
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,890
Peem.

324
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
How have you been?

325
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm fine, Mom.

326
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,010
Are you tired?

327
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm sorry.

328
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,300
I know I'm wayward,

329
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,140
but I shouldn't have let emotions take over that much when we talked.

330
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,850
I also felt bad

331
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,240
for talking to you that way, Peem.

332
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,440
Let bygones be bygones.

333
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,160
Just let it go.

334
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,050
I also want you to be happy in your own way.

335
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I just sold the land.

336
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,350
I now have enough money to live day by day.

337
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,690
Take this money and buy delicious food.

338
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,340
Or you can buy a new guitar.

339
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,730
I want you to have a life like your friends do.

340
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,880
I put my heart into making this for you, Peem.

341
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,320
It took me ages to finish.

342
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,130
I started making it

343
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,440
even before you ran away from home.

344
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,470
Peem.

345
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,210
Why is she crying?

346
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,490
This is May, my close friend.

347
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,780
Your name is May?

348
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,260
I'm Phum.

349
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,120
Phum,

350
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,060
let's do something fun.

351
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,300
Let's go.

352
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,730
This bro's name is Doraemon.

353
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,990
Phum.

354
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,790
May.

355
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,030
Thanks.

356
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,370
It looks so yummy.

357
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,330
Let's go.

358
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,330
Do you like it?

359
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,170
I do.

360
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,730
Let's go there.

361
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
I want a doll.

362
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,570
It's nice to be you.

363
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,940
To be able to meet your family.

364
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,540
You still miss your dad all the time, right?

365
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,470
I always do.

366
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,400
But I'm angry with him some days.

367
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,430
Because he left you?

368
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,750
Nope.

369
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm angry because

370
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,670
he never told me what he thought.

371
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,460
He never revealed what he felt.

372
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,310
Perhaps if I had talked to him more

373
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,760
and helped him sometimes,

374
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,270
he might have felt better

375
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,760
and wouldn't have decided to do that.

376
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,480
May, because I listened to the story between your dad and you,

377
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,900
I had enough courage to call my mom.

378
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,930
We just hung up.

379
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,050
I didn't expect them to come and meet me here.

380
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,910
You're lucky

381
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,430
to get to say what you think

382
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,260
and tell them what you feel.

383
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,790
But look at me.

384
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,290
I still have many things in mind I didn't get to say.

385
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,130
There are so many things we don't understand.

386
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,020
We don't understand why some people do certain actions.

387
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,270
Be frank with me.

388
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,430
Do you still like Mink?

389
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,930
I'm not sure

390
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,280
what this feeling really means.

391
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,970
It started because I felt sorry for her.

392
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,510
I was lonely, also.

393
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,540
How about you?

394
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Do you still like Kong?

395
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,610
Of course, I do.

396
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,930
Seriously?

397
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,530
I thought someone like you could move on easily.

398
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,310
I like him

399
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,180
but don't think of him that way anymore.

400
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:28,320
I mean, I can't erase the feeling that was once there.

401
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,950
But I don't want anything from him now.

402
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,920
What makes him so special to you?

403
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,500
I don't know.

404
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,390
It could be something simple.

405
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,600
Just a smile.

406
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,280
But who would know that

407
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,160
that smile could change me

408
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,330
from someone who wanted to die

409
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,370
to someone who now wants to live?

410
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,050
By the way,

411
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,990
I'm sorry for being upset with you often.

412
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,400
I will stop that behavior.

413
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,120
Which one?

414
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,290
I like to care for others so much

415
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,740
that I forget to care for those close to me

416
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,460
including my family and you.

417
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,080
I'm happy to have you in my life.

418
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,510
Same here.

419
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,980
Here you are.

420
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,760
Two eggs.

421
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,050
May!

422
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,610
You know what?

423
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,580
This is the first day since my dad has passed away

424
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,250
when I feel good to be alive,

425
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,850
seeing something like this.

426
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,450
I forgot how mean this world is to us.

427
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,910
Who's that?

428
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,890
Mink?

429
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,050
If Mom or anyone asks,

430
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,360
don't say you saw me here.

431
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,850
Or did she take the money from Karn?

432
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,270
Hey.

433
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,690
Mom chose fish tofu, your favorite.

434
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,530
Here you are.

435
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,370
It's your favorite, isn't it?

436
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,830
It's once in many months

437
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,530
that we're eating together.

438
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,390
I haven't seen you for ages, Kul.

439
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,390
Kul, you know what?

440
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,190
Your mom can't have enough of that.

441
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,190
She hasn't organized our new house yet

442
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,300
but has already showcased your awards there.

443
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,590
See?

444
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,380
Wait, Kul.

445
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,600
Pull yourself together.

446
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,420
I think

447
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,770
only you can help Max.

448
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,770
And why do I have to die because of this?

449
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,350
Hey, relax.

450
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,760
Top hasn't found out what's on your mind, right?

451
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,250
Just act normal.

452
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,490
Make him completely trust you

453
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,500
that you won't betray him.

454
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,110
Then, we think and look into this carefully

455
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,260
to figure out how to get back at him.

456
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,550
You also want to get back at him, don't you?

457
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,520
We don't know yet the truth

458
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,870
about what actually happened that day.

459
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,580
But what we can be sure of is

460
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,430
Max will never hurt others first.

461
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,870
I'm sure.

462
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,500
Gut.

463
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,300
I think I can no longer buy the house as I told you.

464
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,330
Don't worry, Kul.

465
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,730
Just hang in there.

466
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,910
Let's wait for my first salary,

467
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,310
and we can rent a bigger house.

468
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,710
Don't worry at all, Kul.

469
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,800
Buying a house isn't your responsibility.

470
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,800
Kul, what's wrong?

471
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,060
Why is everyone so good to me?

472
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,920
I suck.

473
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,490
I made a lot of mistakes.

474
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,120
You haven't done anything wrong.

475
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,370
Kul, you're like my idol.

476
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,510
Mom told me to be as talented as you.

477
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,320
Don't be like me.

478
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,910
You have no idea what I did.

479
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,370
Nobody knows what I did.

480
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,840
No matter how much you hate Max,

481
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,540
that's your problem.

482
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,540
But for now,

483
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,670
what you should do is handle that asshole Top.

484
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,840
Don't let him do this to anyone again.

485
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,170
Or else such shit will come back to us one day.

486
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,190
I don't know what problems you have been through,

487
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,700
but if you don't like what you're doing now,

488
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,450
just change it.

489
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,240
At least you still have us.

490
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:51,060
(Top)

491
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,884
(Tomorrow, let me come over to your house. I miss you.)

492
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,741
(Venus exposed her ex-husband's corruption.)

493
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,890
I think everyone should enjoy following up on this news

494
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,650
more than paying attention to the made-up affair.

495
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,100
Though they already got divorced,

496
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
since she's become close with another guy,

497
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,650
her ex-husband must feel she's putting him down.

498
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,470
That's why he feels resentful.

499
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,500
Come on, Mom.

500
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,950
She told us to focus on the corruption thing.

501
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,350
But you're still saying this.

502
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,710
I'm talking about a man who likes to hurt women.

503
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,570
That nonsense dignity, you know.

504
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,330
When he's out of his mind,

505
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,900
he can do anything.

506
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,710
Just like what Dad did?

507
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,920
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
I shouldn't have mentioned him.

509
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,250
It's not solely his fault.

510
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,940
It's partly mine.

511
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,170
Our family was ruined because of us,

512
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,620
more or less.

513
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,630
I don't want others to insult you

514
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,990
for having good-for-nothing parents.

515
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,400
When you got their daughter pregnant,

516
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,070
my heart was almost torn.

517
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,870
I felt sorry for both.

518
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,610
Venus is scary, you know.

519
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,020
I was afraid she would destroy you.

520
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,250
Let bygones be bygones, Mom.

521
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,930
It was really my fault,

522
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,150
so I must admit it.

523
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,430
I know you worry about me a lot,

524
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,210
but if I really do something wrong,

525
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,210
don't protect me.

526
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,050
Or else there could be more problems,

527
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,480
just like how you're helping Mink now.

528
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,050
What did you find out?

529
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,780
Just tell me where Mink is.

530
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,560
How are you doing?

531
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Have you had enough fun already?

532
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,500
Shit.

533
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,520
Those scumbags did such a careless job.

534
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,210
Do you know where Max is now?

535
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,920
I haven't found him.

536
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,050
He managed to f**king run away.

537
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,320
Kul, you must help me find him.

538
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,900
Hey, my dad is coming.

539
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,790
Why did you lie to me?

540
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,410
You told me you already destroyed him, didn't you?

541
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,990
Dad, there's a bit of a misunderstanding.

542
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,090
I'll quickly get it done.

543
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,600
Don't worry.

544
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,180
How can you be calm, huh?

545
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,580
Can't see you how much we got screwed up?

546
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,980
Dad, don't worry.

547
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,250
I'll quickly handle this.

548
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,100
Max can't do anything to us.

549
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,750
He has no evidence.

550
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,310
You got it done already, right?

551
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,570
Yes, Dad.

552
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,330
I asked my friends to delete it already.

553
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,140
Now, there's one left on my phone

554
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,050
in case we need it to destroy him later.

555
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Don't let it get leaked.

556
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,450
Get this into your head.

557
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,940
Top, don't worry.

558
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,810
I'll help you find Max.

559
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,550
I'll wait at the temple

560
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,550
in case he contacts his friends.

561
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,540
Because you're like this,

562
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,240
I love you, Kul.

563
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,200
You should take a shower

564
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,340
so you'll feel comfy.

565
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,190
Okay?

566
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,190
Then, I'll massage you.

567
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,240
I don't like men!

568
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,950
I don't like you,

569
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,880
but just want to make you feel embarrassed.

570
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,110
But you have no right to do this shit to me!

571
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,570
Asshole!

572
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,960
Let go of me!

573
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,680
What are you doing?

574
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,430
A message notification popped up,

575
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,530
so I picked up the wrong phone.

576
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,060
It can't be mine, of course.

577
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,500
Apart from you, nobody talks to me.

578
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,370
How about your friends?

579
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,610
At the university?

580
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,730
I only have those juniors

581
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,730
whom I use for work.

582
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,630
That's why you asked for me often.

583
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,020
You're lonely, right?

584
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,700
That's not what I mean.

585
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,420
I was just asking.

586
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,460
You're right.

587
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,940
I don't have many friends.

588
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,930
Dad asked me to befriend only those who can benefit us

589
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,350
and bring us advancement in life.

590
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,600
I can only be friends with those on the same level.

591
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,280
But it seems

592
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,410
nobody is good enough to satisfy my dad.

593
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,650
You have to ask your dad about befriending someone?

594
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,100
I have to ask him about everything,

595
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,210
so he can probably take care of it for me.

596
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,080
So you asked me to hide

597
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,920
because I'm not good enough to be your friend, right?

598
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,660
It's not like that.

599
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,790
I don't want to look suspicious in front of Dad.

600
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,620
I'm afraid he will find out about my feelings toward you.

601
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,730
He never knows

602
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,920
I don't want to date girls.

603
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,090
It feels sore after taking a shower.

604
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,980
Can you dress my wound for me?

605
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,380
Sure.

606
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,850
Did Max hurt you this much?

607
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,770
Nope.

608
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,770
That was from Dad's cigar.

609
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,090
He got upset sometimes.

610
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,740
But I didn't feel hurt.

611
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,320
He told me that

612
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,400
if I can't even bear this little thing,

613
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,150
I can't bear other things more severe.

614
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,110
When Max punched me,

615
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,410
I felt hurt,

616
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,830
but if I regained consciousness later than I did,

617
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,250
Dad would get mad, thinking that I was weak.

618
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,860
Does he really go this far?

619
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,080
Kul

620
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,060
Yes?

621
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,330
Hug me.

622
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,390
Your dad was mad at you

623
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,810
because his name is involved in the news, right?

624
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,080
Yes.

625
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,200
But don't worry.

626
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,940
He can handle it.

627
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,350
Just bribe them, and that's it.

628
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,410
Even if they have the evidence?

629
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,260
It's just a document.

630
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
How can that work?

631
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,550
It's nice to have a life like yours.

632
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,460
You can live an easy life.

633
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,860
Learn from this, Kul.

634
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,930
Don't take sides with those scumbags.

635
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,930
Though they don't do anything wrong,

636
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,290
my dad can make them wrong.

637
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880
Ouch!

638
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,860
Kul, do it gently.

639
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,180
It hurts.

640
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,180
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,190
Come here.

642
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,030
Why are you lying like that?

643
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,960
Who is he?

644
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:48,120
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

645
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,330
Kong, do you think she will hug me

646
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,550
after I tell her I'm her daughter?

647
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,820
Or will she cry?

648
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,900
But I think I'll cry before she does.

649
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,090
Mom.

650
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,370
Did you have fun at school?

651
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,330
I had a lot of fun.

652
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,870
Really?

653
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,280
Auntie.

654
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,670
Do you have only one daughter?

655
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,660
How is Mink doing?

656
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,090
Did she report the evidence about Karn to the police already?

657
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,250
Mink and Karn just want to beat each other.

658
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,830
Everything they told you two is probably not true.

659
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,910
Whenever we separate,

660
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,040
we're screwed.

661
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
I think it's time for us to reunite.

662
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,460
(Kul:  I need no more than two hours.)

663
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,100
(Let's meet at the club.)
