1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,940
(When people come together, no matter the reason,)

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,500
(I think that turns them into acquaintances,)

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,500
(and a bond is then created.)

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,130
(What holds them together could be the word "friends",)

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,450
(but that means they must have mutual acceptance.)

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,240
Stop!

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,560
Let go!

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,460
How could you do this to me?

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,700
(But if they don't,)

10
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:30,710
(Because society needs a "brave person")

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:31,514
(Venus Pongsawarin, the leader of Brave Power party)

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,140
(they probably meet)

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,270
(only to make a turning point in life.)

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,450
(It could be either a small change)

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,900
(or a significant one, including death.)

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,300
(It's fine if we don't think of each other as friends,)

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,290
(but I never regret that at least we have met)

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,000
(though we almost had no good story to remember.)

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,250
Hello, Mrs. Venus.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,190
Hello.

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,640
May I interview you for further information, please?

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,500
Sure.

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,790
We've heard that you resigned from every position

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,300
at your husband, Mr.Worawat's company.

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,400
Is this true?

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,240
Mrs. Venus,

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,800
please answer the questions naturally.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,100
This is the introductory interview of yourself.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,550
Our team would like to focus on you

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,010
looking more mature than your actual age

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,930
and warm-hearted.

41
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,180
I think you're shaped by these personalities.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,600
What if they ask about my personal matters?

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,690
Please answer only what you can confirm for now

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,300
to ensure our safety.

45
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,400
As for the company,

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,660
I think it isn't completely correct to call it Worawat's

47
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,600
because this business was started by our family.

48
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,990
Regarding my resignation,

49
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,430
I want to confirm that it's true I resigned from every position

50
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,480
and sold all the stocks I held.

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,100
It seems you want to start everything anew.

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,690
Yes.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,610
I don't want to build constructions anymore.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,380
If I have to build something from now,

55
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,050
I'd better create people with feelings and hearts.

56
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,860
That sounds like you want to continue in the field of politics.

57
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,740
Is that your plan?

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,450
Mrs. Venus, you seem to be the mother who understands teens best.

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,220
That's why you're launching this project.

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,210
Where is your middle child, by the way?

62
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,910
(Fulfill your vow at 09.09 AM.)

63
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,700
(It's indeed a super sacred time. Don't cheat.)

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,180
Listen.

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,410
This is my very last time trusting you.

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,270
Damn it.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,100
It's always me who fixes everything in the end.

68
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,300
What's up?

69
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,700
(You started running already, right?)

70
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,770
(Stop by at the condo next to the park.)

71
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,490
Why must I trust you?

72
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,820
(If you don't come here now,)

73
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,250
(I'm surely done for.)

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,520
Hey, you slept with my wife?

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,570
You're done for!

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,620
Kong.

77
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,450
Hey, just jump.

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,450
You son of a bitch!

79
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,700
Run!

80
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,780
Hey, where are you going?!

81
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
Where are you running away to, huh?

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
Why are you so fast?

83
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,330
Hey, you brats!

84
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,080
My husband's towels!

85
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,190
Stop!

86
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,750
Pali, what the hell is this?

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,690
That woman said she likes me.

88
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,440
You can't just fall for any woman who likes you, okay?

89
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,170
Shit. She said she had already broken up with her boyfriend

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,340
but didn't tell me that guy would come back and make up with her.

91
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,810
Damn it. When he opened the door,

92
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,300
I was reaching the climax part.

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,810
Hey.

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,700
You asked your friend to help?

95
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,450
I'll trample you both.

96
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,930
Asshole, you slept with my wife.

97
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,860
How do I have something to do with this?

98
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,010
Just do, okay?

99
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,150
Lord, please hear my voice.

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,710
I'm fulfilling my vow now.

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,290
I promised that we would both run naked

102
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,760
if we got accepted into the same university.

103
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm going now.

104
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,140
- Hey, won't the sacred power think you're cheating? - Trust me. They understand.

105
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,400
Hey, where are you running to?

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,170
Hey, stop.

107
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:00,820
Stop right there.

108
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,530
Why are you guys running naked?

109
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,460
Come with us.

110
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,180
What?

111
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,350
Are you running away, huh?

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,060
- What a chicken. - You're in for it.

113
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,350
Just wait till it's my turn!

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,760
Why are you naked in public?

115
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,590
Hey, bring it on.

116
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,420
Stop.

117
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
Please sign here.

118
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,900
Go in quickly.

119
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,300
Pali?

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,100
What's going on?

121
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,740
Hey, wait.

122
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,050
What's between you two?

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,800
She's my friend.

124
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,500
What were you charged with?

125
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,610
Committing an indecent act in public.

126
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,570
Have you called someone to bail you out?

127
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,080
Can I pay the fine for them?

128
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,500
Hey, it's alright.

129
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,200
I already phoned my family.

130
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,700
Take it.

131
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,610
You must feel so cold.

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,620
How kindhearted you are.

133
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,780
Kindhearted?

134
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,530
Nobody has complimented me like this for ages.

135
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,300
You should have given me that.

136
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,030
Kong, if your mom sees us like this,

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,600
won't she tear me off a strip?

138
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,600
Now, I'm unsure

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,620
what makes my mom angry first.

140
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,700
Because we're looking like this and here in this place?

141
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,510
Or because we're going to jail?

142
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,910
There he is.

143
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,940
Your dad is here.

144
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,900
He's not my dad.

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,130
(This project we're working on is called Youth Club.)

146
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,700
(We'll take care of them, listen to them,)

147
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,980
(and help solve problems)

148
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,930
(for kids and teens with nobody supporting them.)

149
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,260
She's afraid this will affect her reputation, right?

150
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
That's why she didn't come here herself.

151
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,260
She must feel ashamed having a son like me,

152
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,700
so she's treating me as if I didn't even exist.

153
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,210
Kong, don't be pessimistic about everything.

154
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,600
But it's always true.

155
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,290
She didn't even ask me to join

156
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,460
when her kids gathered for a family photo.

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,700
Take some rest.

158
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,300
I'll handle this.

159
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,510
Do you need a lift?

160
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,640
No, thanks.

161
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,860
See you around.

162
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,370
Well, today's atmosphere is kind of unusual.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,250
If you don't want to go home now,

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,800
come with me.

165
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,310
Come on.

166
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,420
Don't say no to me, okay?

167
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,420
You know we only have each other.

168
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,100
Deal.

169
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,940
Lend me your tee.

170
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,640
Honestly,

171
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,540
I thought we wouldn't get to come back here.

172
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,940
Why?

173
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,200
Your mom would cut me out of your life, too?

174
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,700
Don't forget that I'm still mad at you.

175
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,500
Let's put it this way then.

176
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,500
Take this as my 2000th apology.

177
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,000
What's this?

178
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,800
Shit.

179
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,700
I'd never found this before when I cleaned my room.

180
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,700
Don't go too far hooking up with girls, okay?

181
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,580
I know you're being sensitive now,

182
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,210
but if you remain a player like this,

183
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,000
I think you will end up in trouble.

184
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,400
Nope. I didn't bring any girl here.

185
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,100
This belongs to Kanya.

186
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,800
I think she dropped it long ago.

187
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,800
Return it to her for me.

188
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,180
I won't argue with you about my sister anymore.

189
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,500
I know you already paid for it as much as you could.

190
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,200
I won't add insult to injury then.

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,890
I'm fine.

192
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,040
Though I look like I'm dying,

193
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,090
I'm still okay.

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,400
Forget about it.

195
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,100
But the new semester starts tomorrow.

196
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,860
I think we'll face lots of new stories.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,450
We already fulfilled the vow.

198
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,170
Now, we only have to survive studying.

199
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,300
Do you think anyone wants to be friends with us?

200
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,350
Who would want to befriend troublemakers like us?

201
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Damn it. Who knows?

202
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,850
There are still many more troublemakers out there.

203
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,940
Lots of them.

204
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,300
Well said.

205
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,640
From now on,

206
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,100
everything about you will no longer be private.

207
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,530
What we should be careful about is taking care of those around you

208
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,900
and family members

209
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,620
because whenever they face problems,

210
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,010
you also do, Mrs. Venus.

211
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,570
Yes.

212
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,110
Kong.

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,960
Yes?

214
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,090
Won't you tell me what trouble you caused again today?

215
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,460
It's really not a big deal.

216
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,100
It won't ruin your reputation.

217
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,810
You already knew?

218
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,820
It was a grand opening, wasn't it?

219
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,370
You also looked happy, Mom,

220
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,000
while your son was standing naked inside the police station.

221
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,210
Wait.

222
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,660
Okay.

223
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,970
I won't ask what you did today.

224
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,600
But I asked you to work for me.

225
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,600
Can you give me your answer now?

226
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,100
(Damn it. Who knows?)

227
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,160
(There are still many more troublemakers out there.)

228
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,210
The more, the better, I guess,

229
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,810
because my mom asked me to help find teens our age

230
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,310
to join her project.

231
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,550
We'll listen to and help them.

232
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,890
She probably wants to create an angle-look image for herself by helping the public.

233
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,910
You mean that Youth Club?

234
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,580
Damn it. The name sounds so weird.

235
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,410
Yeah.

236
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,610
It's everyone's ideal club,

237
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,260
ready to help solve teens' problems.

238
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,170
She's unbelievable.

239
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,180
She's ready to understand everyone but me.

240
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,179
Do you think you can do it?

241
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:39,508
Of course.

242
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,939
But I'll handle it my way.

243
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:47,201
I think I've just come up with something fun.

244
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,460
Sure.

245
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,365
I'll help you, Mom.

246
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,801
(NO VIOLENCE FOR FRESHY WELCOMING ACTIVITY)

247
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:02,770
No freshy welcoming activity! (NO VIOLENCE FOR FRESHY WELCOMING ACTIVITY)

248
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:02,800
No freshy welcoming activity!

249
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,028
(WE WANT FREEDOM OF DRESS CODE.) No freshy welcoming activity!

250
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:03,042
(WE WANT FREEDOM OF DRESS CODE.)

251
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:03,930
We want freedom of dress code! (WE WANT FREEDOM OF DRESS CODE.)

252
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,297
We want freedom of dress code!

253
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,468
No freshy welcoming activity!

254
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,468
We want freedom of dress code!

255
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,699
No freshy welcoming activity!

256
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,844
We want freedom of dress code!

257
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,165
No freshy welcoming activity!

258
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,062
We want freedom of dress code!

259
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,677
We want freedom of dress code!

260
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:17,768
No freshy welcoming activity!

261
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:19,635
We want freedom of dress code!

262
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:20,863
No freshy welcoming activity!

263
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,702
Hey? Pali?

264
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:44,557
I knew you got accepted into this university

265
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,060
but didn't know we're in the same faculty.

266
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,059
You too, Kong?

267
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,743
We meet again.

268
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:54,619
Ouch.

269
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey.

270
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:57,097
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,481
You're bringing so many things.

272
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:06,805
Are you selling them?

273
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,299
Well,

274
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:12,005
I'm bringing them just to boost my confidence.

275
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,297
Hey, take it.

276
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,610
(Aren)

277
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,004
It already belongs to someone, doesn't it?

278
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,545
It doesn't.

279
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,402
It's just that I like naming stuff.

280
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:27,320
Huh?

281
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,789
You named this inhaler?

282
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,008
Yeah.

283
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,045
I named everything.

284
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,616
Thanks.

285
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,056
How cute.

286
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,408
I'm meeting a kindhearted person again.

287
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,653
Kong.

288
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,303
Yeah?

289
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,979
Don't forget to return the tee I lent you that day.

290
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,410
Oh, okay.

291
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:52,660
I'm sorry. I didn't know I'd meet you today.

292
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:06,939
Why is he here?

293
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,623
Welcome all the first-year students of the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

294
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,108
I wondered why Mom wanted me to study here that much.

295
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:15,001
I got it now. She sent him to report her about my behaviors.

296
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,902
We're glad to share this same moment with you all,

297
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,008
and we will grow together.

298
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,659
Our university believes that

299
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,373
what suits our students best is

300
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:27,226
being supported by someone ready to help.

301
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,669
That's why we are now in partnership with Youth Club

302
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:32,373
to create and offer help.

303
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,219
We'll introduce this project to everyone this evening.

304
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:46,262
Are they tricking us into direct selling or what?

305
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:49,860
Or is it a creed or something?

306
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:53,980
I think this sounds interesting.

307
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,980
Something good is probably waiting for us.

308
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:04,977
I think

309
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:06,979
it's time for some fun.

310
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,207
Hi, Dad.

311
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,622
When will you pick me up to live with you?

312
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:31,102
(Did you ask your mom about it?)

313
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:32,908
You know what?

314
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:36,619
I asked her, and she told me to ask you.

315
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,478
Now that I'm asking you,

316
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,111
you're saying this to me.

317
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,622
What should I do then?

318
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,622
Why do you want to move there that much?

319
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,622
Staying here is already good.

320
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:48,303
Why can't you wait until you graduate?

321
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,219
I'll hang up, Dad.

322
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,097
Yes.

323
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,671
You also said the same thing when I was in middle school.

324
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,303
Now I've finished high school

325
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,937
but haven't got to move anywhere yet.

326
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,850
Grandma, do I have to wait until I graduate?

327
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:06,976
You keep being obsessed with other things.

328
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:10,128
You don't do what you're really supposed to do.

329
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,745
You never pay attention to it.

330
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,660
You forgot to buy green onion, didn't you?

331
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:15,660
Oh, my bad.

332
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,660
You're always behaving like this.

333
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:21,939
But for something like green onion,

334
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,908
I guess people won't even care if you don't put it in.

335
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,620
While eating, they get rid of it anyway.

336
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:31,620
An unwanted thing, you know.

337
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:34,703
You're being rhetorical.

338
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,660
How was your first day at the university, by the way?

339
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,256
It was nice.

340
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,708
There's one project at the university

341
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:49,259
I want to join.

342
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,208
After I'm done with this, please let me join.

343
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,845
What project? Huh?

344
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,448
Don't use it as an excuse.

345
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,312
It's only your first day at the university,

346
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,743
but you've already turned promiscuous?

347
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:01,694
Grandma, don't be too hard on me.

348
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,742
Finally, the day has arrived.

349
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,259
When a daughter has grown up,

350
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:07,197
she always causes trouble.

351
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,118
Grandma, why are you saying this to me?

352
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,395
I haven't done anything terrible.

353
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,758
What's with your disrespectful voice just now?

354
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:14,877
You think you're mature enough

355
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,374
to say anything you want?

356
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,401
You believe whatever you think or do is right, don't you?

357
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:30,660
Grandma, relax.

358
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,222
There's nothing bad at all.

359
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,804
You've seen me your entire life.

360
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,291
Have I been such a worry to you?

361
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,007
Please trust me, Grandma.

362
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,497
Finish this.

363
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,401
Get home safe.

364
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,022
Is this your car?

365
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,281
Wow.

366
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,176
This is my dream car.

367
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:06,977
You can take a look inside.

368
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,503
No, thank you.

369
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:09,980
But if you're free,

370
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:11,620
I want to meet you often.

371
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,737
Don't forget to miss me sometimes.

372
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:17,306
I have so many guys to miss.

373
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,819
What should I do to miss you, Kul?

374
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,819
Will this help?

375
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,808
Give me a call.

376
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,348
Shit.

377
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:44,300
I did this much, but you only gave me 500 THB?

378
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:45,894
Foolish.

379
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:58,847
You took more money!

380
00:19:58,856 --> 00:19:59,937
It was my idea!

381
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:00,629
That's not the point.

382
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:01,675
I'm the one who worked!

383
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,152
- So what? - What? Huh?

384
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,102
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you two?

385
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,205
Chao claimed that he's older,

386
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:10,220
and he took more coffin donation money,

387
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:11,161
while it was actually my idea.

388
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,251
You keep saying you're younger.

389
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,042
You just sat there and watched me work,

390
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,848
but now you want more money, huh?

391
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:17,164
The money...

392
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,208
Stop already.

393
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:22,045
If Luang Por knows you're fighting because of this,

394
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,401
you'll be kicked out of the temple.

395
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:24,715
That's good

396
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:26,051
so he will finally learn that

397
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,629
we brothers must earn money this hard

398
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,222
because the money to cover temple expenses

399
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,065
and my meals was used up for your tuition fee already!

400
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,065
Be frank with me.

401
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:37,805
What right do you have to use the temple's money?

402
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:39,708
I told you already.

403
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:42,219
I borrowed it for this first semester only.

404
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:43,330
I didn't just take it.

405
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,654
The semester has started already, right?

406
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,690
Ask your new and rich friends to help you then.

407
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,857
Or does nobody at the university talk to you?

408
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,060
Tell me.

409
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:55,568
But I kind of sympathize with you, you know.

410
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:57,420
Look at you.

411
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,342
You'll see.

412
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,503
I'll make good

413
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,300
and rich friends,

414
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,502
so I can finally get away from this kind of life.

415
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,305
I think she didn't mean to do it.

416
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:22,521
She's this little.

417
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,699
She wouldn't want to be a thief.

418
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,536
Do you think that her innocence could make her sneak to the cashier,

419
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:29,571
open the cash drawer,

420
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,659
and take all the money?

421
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:33,328
It's your fault, Peem.

422
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:34,394
How could this have something to do with me?

423
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,260
It's your fault, indeed,

424
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:37,401
because you're too soft-hearted.

425
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,742
You want to be a good person so much that you're brainless.

426
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:41,090
I told you already

427
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,860
not to allow others to sell inside our store.

428
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:44,611
Won't you give others a chance at all?

429
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,179
I gave you once, didn't I?

430
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,180
Now what?

431
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:48,425
Instead of helping me,

432
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:50,007
you end up sympathizing with a thief.

433
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:51,660
See?

434
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:54,659
Got it now?

435
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:57,657
I'll think that you conspired with her.

436
00:21:58,521 --> 00:21:59,445
Take it.

437
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:00,368
Now, get lost.

438
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,401
You insulted me that I never give anyone a chance, right?

439
00:22:04,973 --> 00:22:06,262
Fine. You're right.

440
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,259
You're fired!

441
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,271
(Landlord: If you still can't pay the rent this month,)

442
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,804
(I'll ask you to move out.)

443
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,537
Damn it.

444
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,004
What a lousy day.

445
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,404
Shit!

446
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,908
Everyone, thanks for coming.

447
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,820
Welcome to the club.

448
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:16,503
It's alright.

449
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:18,699
We're just starting.

450
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,740
I think I was too careless this time.

451
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:26,780
I believed everything would be easy and go as expected.

452
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:30,417
But I think I made the wrong plan.

453
00:24:31,176 --> 00:24:33,859
The first group of people we have to fight with are those

454
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,013
we want to take our side.

455
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,180
Jate, can you really help me work on this?

456
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,146
I'm seriously doing that for you now.

457
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,457
You know that, don't you?

458
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,097
When is he coming back?

459
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:03,177
Soon.

460
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,177
But he has probably found out about this whole thing.

461
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,699
He can handle things a lot faster than we expect.

462
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,505
As things have turned out this way,

463
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,463
I'm kind of worried now.

464
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:46,408
Hey, you enjoy pranking others that much?

465
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:49,583
You're deceiving us, aren't you?

466
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,019
You claimed that this is about Youth Club.

467
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,410
This is totally unfair for those who really want to join.

468
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,057
I do apologize for distressing you all.

469
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:05,105
I've heard that many don't really trust that club

470
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,371
as they aren't sure of what they will be asked to do.

471
00:26:07,385 --> 00:26:08,140
So, I've just come up with an idea that

472
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,863
if there's a space where everyone can gather

473
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:14,176
to have fun while also trusting each other,

474
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:15,945
it's better, isn't it?

475
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,819
But can we trust you then?

476
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,819
If you really want to listen to that project,

477
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,259
I can give you the location.

478
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,620
It's not far from here.

479
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,245
Damn. What the hell?

480
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:25,802
What a waste of time.

481
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:31,082
If all of us use this one space

482
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,982
to try doing whatever we want to

483
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,105
and being whoever we want to

484
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:38,109
without being judged by anyone,

485
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,511
it's a good idea, isn't it?

486
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,072
Just form our own club.

487
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,871
Whatever you think is best.

488
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,435
Actually, this club is just one of your options.

489
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:52,500
Feel free to either stay or leave.

490
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:54,511
Let's go.

491
00:26:54,527 --> 00:26:55,782
What's the point of staying?

492
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:57,637
Let's go.

493
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,863
Damn.What a waste of time.

494
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:17,632
Here we go.

495
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,742
Why go to other clubs?

496
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:32,099
This place sounds like a lot of fun.

497
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:08,005
I'm Tam.

498
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm Kong.

499
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,909
What do you think about this?

500
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:18,549
I'm a bit worried

501
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,057
because I told Grandma I'd join a university event.

502
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:24,056
Now, it looks like I lied to her.

503
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,139
But we're all your university friends.

504
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,059
It's not different from what your grandma probably imagines.

505
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,407
Well, I'll give it a try then.

506
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,303
I hope you won't disappoint me.

507
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:45,299
Or probably someone has sent them to be our friends?

508
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:53,214
So, we only have all of you left.

509
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,900
Nope. I mean,

510
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,737
you all have been selected.

511
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:58,300
Let's get to know each other more, shall we?

512
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:00,706
Let's play a game.

513
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:03,817
Drink if you're single.

514
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,063
That easy?

515
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:08,063
Why not?

516
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:09,065
Say anything you want.

517
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:11,180
Ask any question if you like.

518
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,087
Alright.

519
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,180
My turn.

520
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,111
Who has more than 50K followers?

521
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,804
Whoa.

522
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:23,539
What a celebrity.

523
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:24,518
You're an influencer, aren't you?

524
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:26,900
I have fewer than 300 followers.

525
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,900
Does that really matter?

526
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,657
I'm not that surprised.

527
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,450
Tam, you've stayed quiet for too long.

528
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:37,607
It's your turn now.

529
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:39,505
Me?

530
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:47,659
Who got an average o-net score of more than 80?

531
00:29:50,217 --> 00:29:51,148
Is that really your question?

532
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:54,297
- Why? I couldn't come up with anything else. - Wait.

533
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,379
- I'm smart, you know. - Your score was below that.

534
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:58,202
You just got 62.

535
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,075
Hey.

536
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:01,256
Yours was 50. I remember that.

537
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,309
Does this sound too nerdy?

538
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,300
Same here.

539
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:07,038
I don't drink.

540
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,940
I have to get up early tomorrow.

541
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,102
Isn't that because you're a noob?

542
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:14,208
Hey. My turn.

543
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:16,154
Mine is a lonely vibe.

544
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,620
Who is living alone?

545
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:23,628
Hey. Are you serious?

546
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:24,880
Is there any room available at your place?

547
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,502
Can I rent a small corner to live in?

548
00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,133
Are you serious?

549
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:30,900
Yeah.

550
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,900
I can't afford to pay the rent anymore.

551
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,250
Wait.

552
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,859
You two discuss that later, okay?

553
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:38,850
Who hasn't spoken yet?

554
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:41,379
You.

555
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:48,075
Wait.

556
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:49,682
You haven't asked a question yet.

557
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,309
Don't you want to find someone with something in common?

558
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,300
Playing a game won't help.

559
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,207
Just surviving another day is already worth celebrating.

560
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,810
Don't you think?

561
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,931
Cheers.

562
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,071
Last person.

563
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,340
My turn.

564
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:09,407
I'll make it easy.

565
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,497
Any middle child here?

566
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:31,780
Come on.

567
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,284
Seriously?

568
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:35,709
So we're a gang of troublemakers now.

569
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:36,936
Troublemakers? No.

570
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:39,262
You know how glad I am seeing you all gather here.

571
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,505
Making new friends at the university isn't easy.

572
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,380
Are we friends now?

573
00:31:44,401 --> 00:31:46,011
Yeah. Can't we?

574
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:47,902
Any rules for our friendship?

575
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:49,902
Not treating each other like crap is enough, I guess.

576
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:51,108
What other rules do you want?

577
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:53,739
No romantic relationship.

578
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,392
No sex.

579
00:31:56,754 --> 00:31:58,423
Or else we'll be screwed.

580
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:01,942
Alright then.

581
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:03,857
I'll give you the passcode to enter this place.

582
00:32:03,872 --> 00:32:05,518
I want to make it everyone's space.

583
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:07,063
Do anything you want.

584
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:08,248
Talk about anything you want.

585
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:11,179
If you have any problem, just come and stay here.

586
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,302
I think we must name our gang.

587
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,499
Make it as weird as Youth Club is.

588
00:32:17,358 --> 00:32:19,499
Well then,

589
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:23,105
cheers to the opening of Wednesday Club,

590
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:24,946
everyone's safe zone.

591
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:26,302
Damn cool.

592
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,506
Cheers.

593
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:36,863
Kong, I think Youth Club sent someone to handle us.

594
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,779
If they know you're with me here, I'm done for.

595
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:40,819
Why are you running away?

596
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:41,696
We aren't doing anything wrong.

597
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,734
You can't imagine what my mom can do.

598
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:44,758
How does your mom have something to do with this?

599
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:47,577
The Youth Club we're playing with is owned by Kong's mom.

600
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:48,281
She's the owner?

601
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:48,714
Yeah.

602
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:49,161
Yeah.

603
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:49,642
Run!

604
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:50,511
Now.

605
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,342
Well, I'm sorry.

606
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:37,980
I didn't mean to make things turn out this way.

607
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,739
Let me know what I can do to compensate for this.

608
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,419
I really didn't know this would happen.

609
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,106
Don't get mad.

610
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:47,808
No worries.

611
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:50,339
I think it's fun.

612
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:53,208
It's enjoyable facing this kind of thing sometimes.

613
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:56,902
Or else I wouldn't get to stay here with you, Kong.

614
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,377
Do you know

615
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,182
you're the reason I decided to come today?

616
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:16,059
Let's change from compensating for this

617
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:22,057
to getting to know each other better.

618
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:41,208
(Youth Club's grand opening was a phenomenon,)

619
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,220
(but their first activity was totally a flop.)

620
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:46,410
(An empty club nobody pays attention to.)

621
00:34:46,423 --> 00:34:48,746
(What a shattered dream for Mrs. Venus of Gen X)

622
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:50,330
(as no students joined her.)

623
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,500
(Was the party just their gimmick?)

624
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:56,348
(Does Youth Club really exist?)

625
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,277
(Nobody went there.)

626
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,943
(The leaked photo just shows a party.)

627
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,260
(What a liar.)

628
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,890
(Kanin)

629
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:14,574
Hello.

630
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,574
(Don't post anything)

631
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,579
(or respond to any comments)

632
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,013
(because people will misinterpret them.)

633
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:23,539
(The PR team will handle it for you.)

634
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,099
From now on, if I want to do anything,

635
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:28,305
I have to get approval from the team first, right?

636
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:30,111
(Please trust us, Mrs.Venus.)

637
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:32,111
(We can handle this better.)

638
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:33,620
Okay.

639
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:35,500
What did you do, Mom?

640
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,647
I'm supposed to ask you that, Kong.

641
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:43,742
Why did you send your men to barge in my place?

642
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,102
Are you a mafia already?

643
00:35:46,112 --> 00:35:47,749
Why have you gone this far?

644
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,908
Are you taking revenge on me?

645
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:51,108
What revenge are you talking about?

646
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,582
You were mad at me

647
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,805
because I convinced your targets to join me.

648
00:35:55,016 --> 00:35:56,302
But I didn't force them.

649
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,459
They made their own choices.

650
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,660
Kong, stop.

651
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,712
I have nothing to do with what you said.

652
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,576
Someone broke in?

653
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:05,899
What happened?

654
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,404
Kong, what did you do?

655
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,577
What event did you host last night?

656
00:36:12,131 --> 00:36:14,151
What you did is already wrong in the first place.

657
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:15,706
Don't count my issue in.

658
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:17,260
Just forget about it.

659
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,020
Everything is already ruined anyway.

660
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:22,020
Who did that to you?

661
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,020
Did you see their faces?

662
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,368
Kong.

663
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,140
I think there's one thing I should let you know.

664
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,780
From now on, you must be careful

665
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:39,819
when you make friends or meet someone new

666
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,013
because I'm not sure anymore

667
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,200
what else our family will have to go through.

668
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:49,137
So you're planning to go into politics as rumored, aren't you?

669
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:54,577
Why do you risk your family members as hostages in your game?

670
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:56,983
You'll find out soon.

671
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,983
Why do you keep saying this to me?

672
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,822
Do you think I'm that young?

673
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,822
Why can't you tell me what you're doing?

674
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:07,899
Mom, you know what?

675
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,099
You can't do it.

676
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:14,742
You're still cutting those you dislike out of your life.

677
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:17,502
How can you open up your mind to help others?

678
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,607
I think it's already safe in here.

679
00:37:49,663 --> 00:37:51,013
This was my mom's house

680
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:52,543
when she was a kid

681
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:54,540
before my grandpa became rich.

682
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,475
My brother once used this house as a store,

683
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:01,005
and Mom asked him to close it down.

684
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:02,536
Luckily,

685
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,220
there's plenty of stuff left to use.

686
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:10,059
But your mom seems to know nothing about what happened last night.

687
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,785
Honestly, I would have believed what she said

688
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:16,022
if she hadn't treated us three kids like that.

689
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:19,622
Why are you laughing?

690
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,620
I'm laughing in tears.

691
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:24,940
Honestly,

692
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:30,222
I think your mom just probably wants to handle me,

693
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,146
separating us from each other for good,

694
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:34,739
like how she did to Kanya and me.

695
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,100
Shit. What the hell?

696
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:10,922
Pali.

697
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:11,811
Pali.

698
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,811
Now, think carefully.

699
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,205
Did you sleep with someone's wife again?

700
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,638
Her husband is probably here to make you pay for it.

701
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:17,545
Nonsense.

702
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:18,967
I haven't slept with anyone anymore.

703
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,207
This has nothing to do with me.

704
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,165
From now on, you must be careful

705
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:33,102
when you make friends or meet someone new

706
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,662
(because I'm not sure anymore)

707
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:36,662
(what else our family will have to go through.)

708
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,410
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

709
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:33,755
Men and women can never be friends.

710
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,611
They can, actually,

711
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:36,770
if they don't think of each other that way.

712
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,148
Are you stealing?

713
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,419
I bought it to share with everyone.

714
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,623
Thanks for letting me move here.

715
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:43,139
You know well what I want.

716
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:47,773
Women and men can really be friends.

717
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:49,143
I will return the best favor

718
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:50,740
to make it worth your generosity.

719
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:52,112
I'll help you.

720
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:55,060
Don't you know Tam has a crush on you?

721
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,628
Are you hiding something from us?

722
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:01,348
Just say it.

723
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,798
Don't make it such a big deal.

724
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,001
Why does it have to be Tam?

725
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:05,970
She likes me.

726
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:07,008
Perfect.

727
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:08,942
Kong, if you want to date someone,

728
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:11,155
can I be one of your choices?

729
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:13,697
You guys are breaking the first rule so soon.

730
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:15,111
I'm sure this will be fun.
