1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,549
You call this 'a little accident'?

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,539
I told you how much this cost, didn't I?

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,819
Do you think you can repay for this?

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,989
I didn't mean for it to happen.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,760
It was an accident.

6
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,599
And I'm having problems with money right now.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,159
If there is any way I can repay for it,

8
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,749
I'm in.

9
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,350
Who's that?

10
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,220
Top from the fourth year.

11
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:17,861
He's the gold medalist for all the races.

12
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,869
Unbelievable!

13
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,860
Our Max on lane 6 got to the finish line!

14
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,970
I'm not taking it.

15
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,349
I care about you.

16
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,829
Why is it?

17
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,269
Why can't the person I love be you?

18
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,519
If you really have feelings for Mink,

19
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,009
I don't think it's going to be worth it.

20
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,399
Why don't you just tell her

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,789
that you're not going to take her with you?

22
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,839
What are you holding your tongue for?

23
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,759
Isn't it time to say it, Mom?

24
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,199
She should be thankful

25
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,299
that we took her in and raised her.

26
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,299
It's way better than being a homeless kid

27
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,380
born from a wretched mom like that.

28
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,840
Tam.

29
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,839
If you think I'm the unwanted one,

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,009
why did you take me in?

31
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,130
Tam!

32
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,619
Mom!

33
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,620
Grandma!

34
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,040
Have you talked to Pali?

35
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,049
I will talk to your mom.

36
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,729
I will show her

37
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,030
that I'm no longer who I used to be.

39
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,709
Peem,

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,019
that one is...

41
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,409
It's... already broken.

42
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,699
You're right, Phum.

43
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,420
That's why I have to earn money to buy a new one.

44
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,290
Give me your hand.

45
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,169
Phum, stay here and do your painting.

46
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,330
Don't go anywhere.

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,349
I'll find money to buy a new guitar,

48
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,669
and if I can get much enough,

49
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,329
we can spend some on snacks.

50
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,300
Okay?

51
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,849
Don't go anywhere.

52
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,340
I'll go now and hurry back.

53
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,280
(Donation for Education Fund)

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,090
Phum!

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,169
Peem.

56
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,779
I told you

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,659
not to take him to a place with many people.

58
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,849
You know he's in an unwell condition.

59
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,029
How can we let him stay home all the time, Mom?

60
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,809
He keeps lamenting that he wants to go out every day.

61
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,660
Is it you or he who actually wants to go out?

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,259
Who keeps focusing on having fun

63
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,979
and enjoying his own happiness?

64
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,749
Mom, what do you want me to do then?

65
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,149
You told me to take care of him,

66
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,319
and I've been doing it.

67
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,029
How about my life?

68
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,789
Can't I live my own life at all?

69
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,839
Do I have to only take care of him?

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,329
I have told you many times that

71
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,479
everyone in our family must take care of Phum.

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,610
You're so selfish for saying this.

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,389
(Mom, I've made up my mind already.)

74
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,069
(I'll move to Bangkok.)

75
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,250
(I want to live my own life.)

76
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,629
(If that's your decision, )

77
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,039
(make sure you survive!)

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,709
(Someone like you doesn't care about anyone anyway.)

79
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,989
(Get away if you want to.)

80
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,720

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,469
Peem, you ran away from home

90
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,519
to live alone.

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,519
You're so happy now, aren't you?

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,679
That's not true, Phum.

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,149
I'm lonely and miss home a lot.

94
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,579
But I really don't dare to go home.

95
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,639
Why are you feeling guilty now?

96
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,820
Peem, you're so mean to me.

97
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,199
Peem, you're so mean to me.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,790
It's not like that, Phum.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,550
You're so mean to me.

100
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,570
You're so mean.

101
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
Mink.

102
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,380
Karn, where is Mink?

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,949
Hey, what's your problem?

104
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,949
Be careful when you mistake someone for someone else.

105
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,669
Don't you think I have feet to handle you?

106
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,779
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,579
I thought you were someone else.

108
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,450
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,450
What should I do then?

110
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,389
I'm already upset.

111
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,519
Well, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,799
He mistakes someone for someone else often.

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,079
He's shortsighted.

114
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,719
Where have you been?

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,999
I was so worried about you.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,589
Peem, I just went to buy some stuff.

118
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,389
Can you not be too wary?

119
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,120
I don't know.

120
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,669
Next time, if you're going out at night,

121
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,679
you must let me accompany you.

122
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Peem.

123
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,659
Okay.

124
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,310
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,039
I guess I'm too worried.

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,349
But I don't want anyone to be in danger

127
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,790
while I can't help them again.

128
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,569
Phum!

129
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,179
I have told you many times that

130
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,189
everyone in our family must take care of Phum.

131
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,000
You're so selfish for saying this.

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,020
I really can't let it happen again.

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,860
(Youth Club has launched the help center for teens and is ready to support them in all aspects.)

134
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,859
No matter being hurt much or little,

135
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,429
I think she's already learned a lesson.

136
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,799
I think she won't mess with you

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,609
or do anything that annoys you again, Mr. Thachai.

138
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,839
Please allow me to reclaim my concession agreement.

139
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,959
Or else, I'm ruined for sure.

140
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,179
I have already invested everything

141
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,680
in the construction in this project.

142
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,619
Whatever I do, I do it clearly.

143
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,579
If you want me to sign and approve it,

144
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,140
we must clear things up 100%.

145
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,529
I've heard that

146
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,489
a no-name crappy boy beat you in the swimming competition.

147
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,820
Am I right?

148
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,239
I'm sorry, Dad.

149
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Who is he?

150
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,999
He's Max, a first-year student.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,870
Why is he talented?

152
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:23,959
From which family is he?

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,419
I've heard he's a temple boy

154
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,070
but he received a scholarship.

155
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,339
He got to the finish line!

156
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,419
Max!

157
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,849
You're the best!

158
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,429
I'm not taking it.

159
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,149
Youth Club offered me help.

160
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,859
And I believe that many people here would be given a good opportunity

161
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,859
just like I was.

162
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,860
He's funded by.

163
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,969
Mrs. Venus.

164
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,970
Venus, again?

165
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,179
I told you

166
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,070
I don't like something like this.

167
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,030
I don't like it when someone gets in our family's way.

168
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,830
You know what you should do, right?

169
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,700
You know what you should do, right?

170
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,880
Hey!

171
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,719
What are you doing?

172
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,719
Where did you get this gun?

173
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,729
It's May's.

174
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,729
Is someone our age allowed to own a gun?

175
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,649
We can't, of course.

176
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,199
It's illegal.

177
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,269
Do you agree with me

178
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,630
that everything around us now has gone wrong?

179
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,989
Can you reach Kanya?

180
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,539
Not yet.

181
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,119
I'm afraid she has flown abroad already.

182
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,940
Can't I just even say goodbye to her?

183
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,619
You know what?

184
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,999
I've tried to behave well

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,389
and make things look as normal as possible.

186
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,470
Great job.

187
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,029
That's because I don't want anyone to insult me

188
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,550
that I was born rich and have turned an asshole.

189
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,239
But it seems that thought has locked me up forever.

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,509
There hasn't been any damn second in my life

191
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,350
when I could do what I wanted to.

192
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,479
I never want others to look at me that way

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,040
until the day

194
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,869
my mom asked Kanya and Gun

195
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,860
to take a family photo without me.

196
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,459
That was when I realized

197
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,090
what I had been doing all along is damn meaningless.

198
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,210
No matter how well I behave, she never recognizes it.

199
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,249
I don't know why she hates me this much.

200
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,340
What if you can choose?

201
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,279
I'm not asking for much.

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,639
I just want to be happy.

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,919
I just want to have fun in my place

204
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,660
without being seen

205
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:56,759
and judged by anyone.

206
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,009
That's why I wanted to form this club.

207
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,569
If Mom, who never knows how I feel, is about

208
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,150
to take away my little happiness again,

209
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,819
let me go all out with this last pleasure then.

210
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,330
I won't give a shit about anything.

211
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,179
Kong!

212
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,510
What?

213
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,129
I think you should stop.

214
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,129
What's the point of spiting your life?

215
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,499
This doesn't f**king help.

216
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,799
Doesn't help?

217
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,019
Can't I just have 5 or 10 minutes

218
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,119
doing whatever I want without stress?

219
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,150
Can't I even do that?

220
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,479
This is not who you are.

221
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,899
Really?

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,789
Do you think you're the only one who can keep happiness to yourself?

223
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,190
Do you think you're the only one who can spite your life?

224
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,840
And do you think all the girls can only like you?

225
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,740
Who do you like then?

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,320
Tell me who.

227
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Kanya.

228
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,669
So it's probably just me

229
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,179
who loves Dad and Grandma.

230
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,179
If you think I'm the unwanted one,

231
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,039
why did you take me in?

232
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,170
Why didn't you let me die with that wretched mom

233
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,539
that Grandma always curses at?

234
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,299
If I were to choose,

235
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,029
I don't even want to live in this house.

236
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,249
I didn't even want to be born.

237
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,640
Tam!

238
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Hey.

239
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,149
Don't worry.

240
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,720
Your grandma will wake up soon.

241
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,919
Thank you so much

242
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,889
for handling this for me.

243
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,209
If we have to go to the public hospital,

244
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,760
the waiting queue must be so long.

245
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,440
It's alright.

246
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,810
Spending money usefully sometimes makes me feel good too.

247
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,640
Okay?

248
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,650
Where is your dad?

249
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,129
Does he still want me to call him Dad?

250
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,129
I don't know where he is.

251
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,290
He's probably freaked out.

252
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,680
And he chose to just run away?

253
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,260
He's always been like this.

254
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,009
I've always been curious.

255
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,349
When we argued,

256
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,350
Grandma often insulted me for behaving like my mom.

257
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,710
I just came to realize that.

258
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,269
Mom she talked about is the one who gave birth to me.

259
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,150
I guess they really weren't ready.

260
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,319
That's why they made you live in this house.

261
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,729
Do you think what they did is wrong?

262
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,429
I don't know.

263
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,139
They probably think it's best for you

264
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,439
and also for them.

265
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,780
But being a woman is tough.

266
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,980
Whatever we do, others seem to easily think it's bad.

267
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,890
Hurry up, please.

268
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,889
What's happening?

269
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,820
Who got hurt?

270
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,219
Why are reporters here too?

271
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,710
Look at this.

272
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,469
(A female politician is reported to get into an accident)

273
00:15:08,494 --> 00:15:11,184
(in the middle of the night together with her close male friend.)

274
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,730
Kanya.

275
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,980
How's Mom?

276
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,580
Pali.

277
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,819
I thought I wouldn't get to see you again.

278
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,899
I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky

279
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,589
that I don't have to go abroad yet.

280
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,490
Don't worry.

281
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,470
Everything will be alright.

282
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:32,549
Okay?

283
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,550
Don't cry.

284
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,060
Kong.'

285
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,390
We're here for you.

286
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,980
Thanks a lot.

287
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,579
What did you do, huh?!

288
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,979
How could this happen?

289
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,699
How is my mom now?

290
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,350
I'm curious too.

291
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,379
What did you two do?

292
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,639
I also want to know what happened.

293
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,410
How dare you ask what happened?

294
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,250
Mrs. Venus is safe now.

295
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,349
It's not your business.

296
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,820
Nobody is allowed inside.

297
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,870
I'll handle everything myself.

298
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,279
You're sad

299
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm still alive, aren't you?

300
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,079
Nus, I'm here to talk nicely.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,529
You're saying this

302
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,589
after you got me almost dead?

303
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,210
Our family's relationship is quite interesting.

304
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,399
I warned you already to end this thing.

305
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,049
It's still not too late

306
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,589
to back out from what you're working on.

307
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,869
Don't risk your life in this.

308
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,469
You know how much power he has.

309
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,969
Yes. I know.

310
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,659
Just like you.

311
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,069
You know full well you're cheating

312
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,779
and indirectly hurting others all the time.

313
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,379
You're rolling in dough

314
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,099
while getting cursed by many.

315
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,909
Be frank with me.

316
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,729
Can you really fall asleep at night?

317
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,319
But I've chosen it this way,

318
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,239
and I'm enjoying this kind of life.

319
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,040
I've already chosen too.

320
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,819
From today, we'll be completely taking a different path.

321
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,819
And I do apologize in advance

322
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,569
if things are getting more violent.

323
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,210
But that's the result of what you've chosen.

324
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,980
Well then, I'll do the same thing too.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,049
This is probably the last time

326
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,779
I can extend my care for you.

327
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,339
If you really want to make a change about this,

328
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,709
you must get hurt.

329
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,719
If I must get hurt or even die

330
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,649
but can stop the evil thing you're doing,

331
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,299
I'll do it.

332
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,369
Say this to your boss too.

333
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm not scared.

334
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,289
At first, I wanted Kong's mom to help Mink.

335
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,320
But seeing this, I'm now blank.

336
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,759
I think we can handle this on our own.

337
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,439
Won't it be too risky

338
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,859
if I involve you in this?

339
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,009
If we don't take risks,

340
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,419
this will never end.

341
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,969
That jerk would think he has the upper hand.

342
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,219
Let Mink tell you everything.

343
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,829
Since I've gotten to know Karn already,

344
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,470
I got this.

345
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,369
Can you tell me

346
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,600
what he did to you exactly?

347
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,810
So we can get back at him the right way.

348
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,059
Karn is addicted to sadistic sex.

349
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,259
Especially on the day he wanted to do it

350
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,969
- but I wasn't ready, - Karn, please don't.

351
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,359
He would force me until I couldn't fight back.

352
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,480
Please don't.

353
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,239
He's hot-headed and gets furious easily.

354
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,149
When he was upset with anything,

355
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,149
he would destroy stuff around him.

356
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,329
Since everything else was destroyed,

357
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,059
there was only me whom he could take it out on.

358
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,789
Since we got married,

359
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,139
he didn't allow me to go back to my family much.

360
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,249
My mom called.

361
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,060
I won't let you talk!

362
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:07,310
It seems I have to stay with him only.

363
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,949
That's why I can't even live my own life.

364
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,560
I don't freaking understand

365
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,080
why he hurt you this much.

366
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,179
But if he tries to lock you up at home,

367
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,919
there must be some evidence there, right?

368
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,379
Can you think of anything?

369
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,880
Actually, there must be some we can use to accuse him.

370
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,219
Some blood stains on those things he used can probably prove my DNA.

371
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,019
I'm also keeping a hard disk of the house's CCTV.

372
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,979
I think that thing is helpful.

373
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,459
But how can we get in and take it?

374
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,089
It's very dangerous.

375
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,819
Nothing is more dangerous than what he has done.

376
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,119
I'll go in and take it.

377
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,670
I don't want this man to scare anyone anymore.

378
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,540
Peem, please really help me.

379
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,129
(The number can't be reached.)

380
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,050
What do you want?

381
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,259
What brings you here?

382
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,479
I'm here to apologize

383
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,169
for talking bad to you last time.

384
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,509
I've now realized I don't want to lose you

385
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,189
just because of that woman.

386
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,080
Please, Karn.

387
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,489
(May, where are you?)

388
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,689
(Pick up my call.)

389
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,229
(And don't do anything yet.)

390
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,840
(I think Karn is more dangerous than we think.)

391
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,820
What do you think?

392
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,449
Do you like it?

393
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,259
It's so beautiful, Kul.

394
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,629
Oho.

395
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,029
I'll work hard while studying,

396
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,729
so we can have enough money to afford this kind of house quickly.

397
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,269
You don't need to wait until then.

398
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,090
We'll have it today.

399
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:03,259
Excuse me, I'll reserve it now.

400
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,939
Now? Where did you get the money from?

401
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,509
This time, whether it's your house,

402
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,120
your car,

403
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:10,439
monthly allowance,

404
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,119
or anything you want,

405
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,219
you'll get it all.

406
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,829
What will it be?

407
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,370
Will you pay for the damage

408
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,110
or agree to my offer?

409
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,440
Fine.

410
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,950
Good boy.

411
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,419
Come on. I'm working, you know.

412
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,390
Whoa.

413
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,870
You're like my hero.

414
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,819
I don't want others to look down on us again.

415
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,099
Got it?

416
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,699
I want us to have a good house

417
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,269
and good quality of life,

418
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,009
so we can be like others too.

419
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,479
Please fill in the document

420
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,859
and sign the contract over there.

421
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,749
Sure. I'll be there in a minute.

422
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,180
Go first.

423
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,529
(I'm choosing a house now.)

424
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,370
(It's not expensive at all.)

425
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,369
(It's cheaper than your watch, Top.)

426
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,889
(Discuss the contract now.)

427
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,670
(I'll transfer you the first sum of money for your house.)

428
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,299
You're talented.

429
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,079
You've just joined but your performance was already phenomenal.

430
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,759
Are you getting a rising star title or what?

431
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,029
I just did as practiced.

432
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,029
And I was probably lucky

433
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,259
that on the competition day,

434
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,849
you weren't in your best condition.

435
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,469
What makes you say that?

436
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,469
I've heard before the competition

437
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,219
that you partied with Kul.

438
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,329
If you were in your best condition,

439
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,830
I might not have won.

440
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,719
It seems you know so many things about me.

441
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,369
I'll treat you as another one of my fans.

442
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,939
I'll give you a great service.

443
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,429
You'll know about me

444
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,790
and get to be more intimate with me than anyone else.

445
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,359
You were angry that day,

446
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,089
so you wouldn't believe in anything I said.

447
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,600
Though she's actually a sister of my friend...

448
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,549
If you knew how messy my gang is,

449
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,869
you wouldn't be surprised

450
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,869
why we don't know about each other's personal matters.

451
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,060
And do you know where Mink is?

452
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,349
I don't know.

453
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,600
Then why are you here?

454
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,689
I'm here to ask you.

455
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,129
If you tell me more about her,

456
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,919
I can probably help you find her.

457
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,469
If that can make you talk to me again,

458
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,919
I'm willing to do it.

459
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,670
I want a kind version of you back.

460
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,099
She's my ex-wife.

461
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,349
Actually, we don't even have to pay attention to her.

462
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,709
Then why are you looking for her?

463
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,369
That's my personal matter.

464
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,669
If you know it, say it.

465
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,960
If you don't, don't say anything.

466
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,929
You told me we could get to know each other

467
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,309
and be friends.

468
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,839
But you won't even tell me about this little matter.

469
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,529
Let's end it here.

470
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,009
Block all of our contact channels.

471
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,510
I'm not important anyway.

472
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,260
May.

473
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,860
Since we're here together now,

474
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,839
let's not talk about someone else.

475
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,840
Let's do something else.

476
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,089
You want to do it with me

477
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,279
or do you just miss her?

478
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,260
Why are you in this irrational mode?

479
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,529
Since I can't replace her,

480
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,119
can you tell me how you like to 'do' it with her?

481
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,530
Well, it's ordinary like how we did.

482
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,630
Nothing special?

483
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,409
If it's really ordinary,

484
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,409
you must have forgotten about her.

485
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,160
There must be something about her you're really fond of.

486
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,130
Ouch.

487
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,109
May.

488
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,990
What did you do?

489
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,449
You don't like it?

490
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,569
I don't like it.

491
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,459
How about this?

492
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,819
What the hell are you doing?

493
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,289
You don't like this either?

494
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,280
I told you I don't like it.

495
00:25:58,281 --> 00:25:59,899
What do you like then?

496
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,039
Do we need any toys?

497
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,360
Or should we find something and do it upstairs?

498
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,569
I want to know how you do it with your wife,

499
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:14,469
so I can probably do at least half of that for you.

500
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,820
So you will run after me too.

501
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,289
Why are you asking so many annoying questions?

502
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,160
(May.)

503
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
Just say what you want to.

504
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:22,989
Why did you do it without talking to me?

505
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,109
(If you can hear me, stop now.)

506
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,279
Just be frank with me.

507
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,879
You don't usually come over to someone else's place.

508
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,619
What do you want?

509
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,030
Tell me.

510
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,380
(May.)

511
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,380
(May.)

512
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,539
No matter what, I can't replace her.

513
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,539
Whatever I do displeases you.

514
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,039
I'll go back now

515
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,430
and handle my feelings on my own later.

516
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,240
Who are you here to see?

517
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,429
What the hell?

518
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,609
You ruined my mood and now you're interrupting me?

519
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,969
Can you not mess with us?

520
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,970
We're f**king.

521
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,950
Dumbass!

522
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,729
Did you just insult me?

523
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,180
I insulted Karn.

524
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,130
Make eye contact with me now.

525
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,239
I was just acting to get by, you know.

526
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,380
If we didn't do it, we would all be done for.

527
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Don't do this again.

528
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,839
I mean,

529
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,889
don't risk yourself that much.

530
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,169
You were insane for doing that to find evidence.

531
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,940
We need several pieces of evidence to accuse him, don't we?

532
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,229
And did you get anything?

533
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,229
You should have just waited for me to go into that house and get it.

534
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,359
What you're going to do isn't risky at all, huh?

535
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,809
Will this thing end then?

536
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,239
It turns out we have to keep running away from him.

537
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,379
We're both involved in this now.

538
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,139
How I wish I had my dad's thing with me now.

539
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,540
Kong shouldn't have taken it.

540
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,529
Hey! What are you doing?!

541
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,419
Don't you know what I'm doing?

542
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,449
I don't like men!

543
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,979
I want you to feel embarrassed.

544
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,249
Ouch!

545
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,250
Let go of me!

546
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,380
Let go of me!

547
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,650
What the f**ck did you try to do?!

548
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,060
Help!

549
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,050
Who hurt my son!?

550
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,049
Excuse me.

551
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,340
Please follow us to the police station for interrogation.

552
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,440
This way, please.

553
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,730
This way, please.

554
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,149
Mrs. Venus, please help me.

555
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,640
Mrs. Venus.

556
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,850
I see.

557
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,039
This jerk is under your care, right?

558
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,540
But I don't care who will help him.

559
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,200
I'll put him in jail no matter what.

560
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,679
I didn't mean to do it.

561
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,279
I was just protecting myself.

562
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,140
Please believe me, Mrs. Venus.

563
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,639
But we need to investigate this to find out the truth first.

564
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,019
The truth?

565
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,850
The truth is my son is now lying in there soaked with blood!

566
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,419
It's because of this devil boy under your care.

567
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,909
He will be charged with attempted murder.

568
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,659
He will be a living death!

569
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,080
This way, please.

570
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
No.

571
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,689
Mrs. Venus, please help me!

572
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,589
I was just protecting myself, Mrs. Venus.

573
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,590
Help me!

574
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,690
(Severe fight!! Furious scholarship boy beat his senior to a pulp.)

575
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,529
(This is clearly attempted murder.)

576
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,589
(He's seriously a beast.)

577
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,030
(Such a person doesn't deserve to be in our society.)

578
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,379
(Mr. Kul, please pay the down payment now.)

579
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,419
(Or else, we can't hold the house for you, )

580
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,960
(and you won't get the deposit back.)

581
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,899
Hello? Kong.

582
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,979
Where is Max?

583
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,579
(He got bailed out already.)

584
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,250
(We're heading to the club.)

585
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,279
You asked for me today

586
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,119
because you already agree to sign

587
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,800
the concession agreement for me, right?

588
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,850
I'll approve it for you.

589
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,850
Here you are.

590
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,570
Give me your hand too.

591
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,369
My hand?

592
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,370
Your hand.

593
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,270
Your five fingers stand for five members of your family.

594
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,299
You're the most powerful one

595
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,970
but can't control those small ones at all.

596
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,440
But here's my motto.

597
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,700
The wicked finger can be cut off.

598
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,609
If you're too brainless to handle anything,

599
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,810
you will end up in trouble.

600
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,930
(A hot-headed scholarship student beat his senior to a pulp.)

601
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,180
Nobody was there that day to be your witness?

602
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,149
Nobody was there.

603
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,369
Others have already gone home.

604
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,159
But why did you have to go that far?

605
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,579
He hasn't regained consciousness now.

606
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,009
Kong, I was hurt that day.

607
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,329
I was just protecting myself.

608
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,559
Max, you jerk!

609
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,110
Bastard!

610
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:56,299
What right do you have to hurt other people?

611
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,819
Kul!

612
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,449
And what right do you have to do this?

613
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,769
Can't you see how much he hurt Top?

614
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,850
An asshole like him doesn't deserve a place in this society.

615
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,839
Why didn't anyone believe in anything I said?

616
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,659
Do my words sound that nonsensical?

617
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,299
Is a crappy like me always the one who's wrong in the end?

618
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,449
Just say it.

619
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,759
Hey, are you still siding with him?

620
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,460
Hey.

621
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:19,040
Shut up.

622
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,020
Say it.

623
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,780
Top was angry with me

624
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,089
because I beat him in that swimming competition,

625
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,089
so he tried to sexually harass me.

626
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,359
But since I didn't yield,

627
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,529
he hurt me.

628
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,289
I was just protecting myself.

629
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,959
Do you have any evidence?

630
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,329
I was in the bathroom.

631
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,449
There wasn't any CCTV.

632
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,799
Do you want me to record everything in my life?

633
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,429
Even when I'm in the bathroom?

634
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,380
This is my last time saying this to you guys.

635
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,090
I'm telling the truth.

636
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,320
Kul,

637
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,159
I think you know Top best.

638
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,659
If you know that something is wrong,

639
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,999
you don't have to help me because it's me,

640
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but at least help reveal the truth.

641
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,330
Can we really trust you, Max?

642
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,540
Why did you ask me that?

643
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Just say what you have to say.

644
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,640
Honestly,

645
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I don't trust Max

646
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,120
since I've found out he works for your mom

647
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,269
to spy on us and Kanya.

648
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,660
(Max:	Most of them are friends of friends.)

649
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,320
Is this true?

650
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
How could you do this to me?

651
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
I've always treated you well.

652
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,539
It's because I'm envious of you.

653
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,049
I want to have the kind of life you have.

654
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,889
I want to have opportunities, money,

655
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,889
and a life like yours.

656
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,369
I want to have a mom who helps me.

657
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,370
I want that too.

658
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,970
Recent hot news reveals about Mrs. Venus, the owner of Youth Club,

659
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,589
who is the future candidate for the House of Representatives.

660
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,239
The insider spills the tea

661
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,279
that the man with her in the car is not just her friend.

662
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,319
It seems they're developing an intimate relationship.

663
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,349
Now, Mrs. Venus will probably have to seriously go through

664
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,186
the political ethics inspection to check if

665
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,689
her qualifications meet the criteria to join politics.

666
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,506
Undoubtedly, this kind of scandal will become

667
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:56,139
the talk of the town as some probably doubt if

668
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:59,328
someone threw a spanner in the works of hers.

669
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,130
Who can I trust from now on?

670
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,569
Max, if you're really wrong,

671
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,569
you must be punished.

672
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,069
My mom can't help you anymore.

673
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,919
But now, all of you, get out.

674
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,890
Get out!

675
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,770
I want to be alone.

676
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,240
Get out!

677
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,930
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

678
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,769
I think we should let Mink come back and stay here.

679
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,129
Karn doesn't know this place.

680
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,080
And on that day,

681
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,749
I'll be the one to lure Karn out of the house.

682
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,769
Why did you decide to take me here?

683
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,339
I'm excited every time I see you.

684
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,609
If you're bored,

685
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,760
we can go somewhere else first.

686
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,010
Where's Mink?

687
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:16,009
What rights have you to meddle with my sister?

688
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,339
There you go.

689
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,600
You never cared about your sister.

690
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,149
Why are people in this house acting all mysterious?

691
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,120
Kong.

692
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:25,559
This is not the time to be all curious.

693
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,689
Let's go.

694
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,369
The one who caused Mom's accident

695
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,870
is our very own Father.

696
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,729
Is there anything I can do to make you hate me less?

697
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,809
The university's come to a conclusion to have you suspended.

698
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,579
If I'm not guilty,

699
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,679
do I still have to lose years of my life?

700
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,859
If you really love me,

701
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,389
you have to help me destroy Max.

702
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,270
If I'm in pain,

703
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,769
he shall be in more pain than I do.

704
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,139
If you don't help me,

705
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,780
you're the one who'll also get in trouble.
