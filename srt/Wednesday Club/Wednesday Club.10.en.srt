1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,090
What kind of person in danger would steal my stuff, huh?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,650
Those are my dad's last items I'm keeping.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,000
Don't argue now, okay?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,550
I won't blame anyone

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,860
if I haven't found out the truth.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,390
How are you doing?

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,950
Had your share of fun?

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,580
It's good you're coming with me.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,070
It's my important appointment today.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,200
Peem!

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,790
I put my heart into making this for you, Peem.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,180
I started making it

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,180
even before you ran away from home.

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,090
I like to care for others so much

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,380
that I forget to care for those around me,

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,080
including my family and you.

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,590
I'm happy to have you in my life.

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,020
Same here.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,550
Grandma praised me that

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,710
I'm gifted in cooking.

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,240
I probably got it from my mom.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,910
Do you want to go talk to her now?

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,380
Not yet.

24
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,760
Not today.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,460
Top wouldn't let Max slide.

26
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,910
He wanted me to help destroy Max.

27
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,930
But I didn't want to.

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,810
But for now,

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,910
what you should do is handle that asshole Top.

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,370
Or else such shit will come back to us one day.

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,110
Don't follow me.

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,240
I asked my friends to delete it already.

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,790
Now, there's one left on my phone

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,970
in case we need it to destroy him later.

35
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,280
Don't let it get leaked.

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,310
Learn from this, Kul.

37
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,090
Don't take sides with those scumbags.

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,090
Though they don't do anything wrong,

39
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,210
my dad can make them wrong.

40
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,110
Ouch!

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,980
Kul, do it gently.

42
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,350
It hurts.

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,170
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,070
Why are you lying like that?

45
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,890
Who is he?

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,030
Someone ordered you a drink.

47
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
May I join you?

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
But I have a girlfriend already.

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,510
I see.

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,760
Don't you want some more friends?

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,930
I see you sitting alone so I thought you might be feeling lonely.

52
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,890
Yes.

53
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,110
I'm feeling lonely.

54
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,450
But my asshole of a best friend

55
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,890
has been facing his life issues on his own.

56
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,550
So I didn't want to disturb him.

57
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,960
But just maybe,

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,840
that asshole of a best friend might come out and be with you

59
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,760
if you give him a call.

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,150
It's lonely sitting over there.

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,750
So we wanted to ask

62
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,540
if you guys are feeling lonely sitting over here.

63
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,260
Not at all.

64
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,680
Because the only luck we have

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,990
is that we both have a lover.

66
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,860
That's Pali 2.0.

67
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,080
You've become so tough.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,170
If it were the old you, you'd have taken them both home.

69
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,000
Well.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
I have become a better person.

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
Why did you call me up?

72
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,790
Is it a big issue?

73
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,090
Pretty big.

74
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,720
But not as big as yours.

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,080
Why are we competing on how screwed we are?

76
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,180
(Kul: I found evidence that can prove Top's guilt.)

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,580
But I think mine might get resolved before yours.

Where's Kul?

88
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,890
I have no idea.

89
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,370
But I think he should be fine.

90
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,140
He just texted me.

91
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,210
So what's up? why did you ask me to come?

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,410
I think

93
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,890
my sister caused some trouble.

94
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,170
My friends said Karn hurts you and is hunting you down.

95
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,360
Then Karn throws a tantrum on me wanting his stuff back.

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,810
Otherwise, he's going to the police.

97
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,160
But you seem chill.

98
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,810
So, what's the whole story about?

99
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,410
What good does it do if you know?

100
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,930
I found the bag in the room.

101
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,310
That's what Karn wants back, right?

102
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,870
You know I don't like it when you mess with my private room.

103
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,020
But you made Peem and May risk their lives going into Karn's house.

104
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,480
For what?

105
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,740
To help me win this game.

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,380
Now Karn's giving up.

107
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,420
He won't go to the police or anything.

108
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,770
It just ends here.

109
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,090
That money is the prize for the winner.

110
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,090
All these things about fooling my friend

111
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,270
are for you to win over Karn?

112
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,460
Yeah.

113
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I must thank your friends.

114
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,600
They're good helpers.

115
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
Are you out of your mind?

116
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
You're so selfish.

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,130
Mom knows what you're like, does she?

118
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,540
She knows.

119
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,340
I think Mom's glad that I won.

120
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,340
Instead of losing like her marriage.

121
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,490
But at least you should give May back her bracelets.

122
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,880
Can't I have it for a keepsake?

123
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,590
You have to apologize to my friends.

124
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,260
Are you embarrassed of me doing this?

125
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,910
I wasn't embarrassed when you caused trouble.

126
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,040
We summoned everyone

127
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,530
so that we'd have more friends.

128
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,590
I didn't think it would bring them to face such trouble.

129
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,110
Whenever we separate,

130
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,030
we're screwed.

131
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,810
I think it's time for us to reunite.

132
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,870
I'm Kul.

133
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,350
Top's junior at the university.

134
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,440
What do your parents do for a living?

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,320
My dad's just a general worker.

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
My mom's a housewife.

137
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,380
How did you befriend this kind of person?

138
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,050
He's in my swimming club.

139
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,780
Why was he lying like that?

140
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,590
Kul is really good at massaging.

141
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,760
When I have to practice so hard that my muscles tense up

142
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,400
Kul would always help to massage me.

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,500
If you want a massage then go to the doctor.

144
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,030
Get your massage at their place.

145
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,130
Don't take him home like this.

146
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,510
It looks disgusting.

147
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,300
And you.

148
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,760
There's no need for you to come here anymore.

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,340
And you.

150
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,950
Start acting like a man as I've always wanted you to.

151
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,580
What are you doing?

152
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,370
What's up with you?

153
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,990
How did you let my dad see?

154
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,430
How would I know he would barge in?

155
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,340
I was sitting there with you.

156
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,900
If my dad finds out I like a man,

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,560
I'd be in trouble.

158
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,720
Not only Max but you would be done for too.

159
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,790
Go home.

160
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,490
Go!

161
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
But I still want to be with you.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,230
Not today.

163
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,810
My Dad might get angry again.

164
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,500
Then I'd be screwed once again.

165
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
You go home.

166
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,440
Go!

167
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,600
So you got her a present.

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,910
Why didn't you tell me?

169
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,260
I'd have gone with you.

170
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,750
I didn't buy it.

171
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,620
I made this myself.

172
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,900
Really?

173
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,940
Will it make do?

174
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,340
Don't you underestimate me.

175
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,200
So, have you given it a name?

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,450
Yes.

177
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,590
It's called Tam.

178
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,320
This thing's called Tam.

179
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,550
Do you think she will hug me

180
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,950
when I tell her I'm her daughter?

181
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,300
Or will she cry?

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,210
But I think I will cry before she does.

183
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,430
Tam.

184
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,230
Did you leave any room for disappointment?

185
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,700
Why would I have to do that?

186
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,350
I'm not planning to hurt her or anything.

187
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,850
That's true but...

188
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,610
I'm a little concerned.

189
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,610
We don't even know her.

190
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,530
We don't know what she's like.

191
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,890
What if

192
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,890
she's not like what you imagined?

193
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,150
Would you be sad about that?

194
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,900
Probably not.

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,710
(Catering service available.)

196
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,940
Mom!

197
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes? What is it, my dear?

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,870
Did you have fun at school?

199
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,920
I had a lot of fun.

200
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,690
Really?

201
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,800
The teacher asked me to draw Mommy too.

202
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,910
Let me see.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,580
Give me a kiss.

204
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,850
One more.

205
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,420
You're so cute.

206
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,390
Tam.

207
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,860
I can take you home right now.

208
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,240
It's okay.

209
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
It has to be today.

210
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,940
I already made up my mind.

211
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,710
We've got a customer.

212
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,710
Let me take that for you.

213
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,320
What can I get you, little Miss?

214
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,030
What does your daughter like to eat?

215
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,090
I'd like to try that too.

216
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,590
She asked what you like to eat.

217
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,060
Fried rice.

218
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,630
I'll have that.

219
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,870
Alright, two of those?

220
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,200
You stay with her.

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Help me serve our customers.

222
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,670
Ask her which drinks she wants, okay?

223
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll be right back.

224
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,780
Okay.

225
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,950
I drew my mom, is it pretty?

226
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,230
Is it pretty?

227
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,100
It is.

228
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,630
As pretty as your mom in real life.

229
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,090
Here you go, fried rice.

230
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,770
Here you go.

231
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
And did you bother them?

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,630
Give me a kiss.

233
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,470
You are a little cutie.

234
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,290
Did you bother them?

235
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,780
Auntie.

236
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,130
Do you

237
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,120
only have one daughter?

238
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,810
I only have one.

239
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,210
I almost exhausted myself to death getting ready to have her.

240
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,800
I tried making an apron.

241
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,870
Please give it a try.

242
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,910
If it's useful,

243
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,140
maybe I'll sell it one day.

244
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
You're really going to give me this?

245
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes.

246
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,550
Look at this.

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,100
Is it pretty?

248
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,410
Pretty, right?

249
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,320
Thank you, little Miss.

250
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,720
You're such a lovely customer.

251
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,310
Bai Por, isn't this sister pretty?

252
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,760
She's pretty just like you.

253
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,350
Such a sweet talker you are.

254
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,890
Please drop by often.

255
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,800
Make yourself at home.

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,310
Let's go.

257
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,300
Come here.

258
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,650
Help me out.

259
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,760
Dad!

260
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,800
She gave me this.

261
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,970
Isn't it lovely?

262
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,050
This is what I wanted to do.

263
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,120
You did your best, Tam.

264
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,520
What are you doing?

265
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,280
(Volunteer)

266
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Have you recovered?

267
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,850
I have recovered.

268
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,750
This is my third session of community service.

269
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,340
I think I'll try blood donation next time.

270
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,140
And for the next, I will probably...

271
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,110
Please don't think of me as a bad person.

272
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,980
It happened before I gave you my words that day.

273
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,770
I haven't done anything bad ever since.

274
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,040
You're acting as if I'm someone keeping tabs on your behavior.

275
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,260
Are you that afraid of me?

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,140
Yes.

277
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,430
Ever since I saw that news about you

278
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,050
I've become more afraid of you.

279
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,590
What have I done

280
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,240
to make you feel this bad?

281
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
It's fine.

282
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,500
You have the right to do so.

283
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,530
Pali.

284
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:08,320
I'm sorry for making your life miserable.

285
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,860
I should have been better to you in the past.

286
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,640
The more I see you,

287
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
the more I see my past self.

288
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,280
I should have realized that everyone can make mistakes.

289
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,970
Look at me,

290
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,510
I still make the same mistakes over and over.

291
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,860
I just realized that

292
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,840
you and your family have been through a lot as well.

293
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,580
I won't make you worry about Kanya again.

294
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,060
Don't trouble yourself that much over love.

295
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,420
You don't think me and Kanya would go far?

296
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,530
It's not like that.

297
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:10,280
I just think that both of you still have a lot of fun things to do.

298
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,030
Don't let one mistake tie you down.

299
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,210
Grow together.

300
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,190
Do what each of you like.

301
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,730
That's probably the good kind of love.

302
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,080
By the way,

303
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,460
you accepted my apologies, right?

304
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,290
Yes.

305
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,080
I forgive you 1000%.

306
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,050
And stop calling me "Miss.".

307
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:46,670
You can call me Mom or Auntie, whatever you want.

308
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes, Mom.

309
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,610
What's going on, Doctor?

310
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,800
The patient was in shock.

311
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,730
Grandma!

312
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,260
I'm here, Grandma.

313
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,670
Wake up, Grandma.

314
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,260
Why are you doing this to me?

315
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,430
Wake up, Grandma.

316
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,760
You said you would recover quickly and go home with me.

317
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,700
What should we eat today?

318
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,560
What about your favorite dish?

319
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,000
Let's not eat my favorite anymore.

320
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,990
Wake up, Grandma.

321
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,160
I don't want to be here anymore, Grandma.

322
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
Tam.

323
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,680
Let's go home.

324
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,570
Tam.

325
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,900
No more of my favorite dish, Grandma.

326
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,660
Tam.

327
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,190
Tam.

328
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,360
Let's go home, Grandma.

329
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,230
I don't want to be here anymore.

330
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,900
Tam.

331
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,490
My condolences.

332
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,540
I can't take this.

333
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,010
No.

334
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,730
Not today.

335
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,570
Grandma.

336
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,450
Then who's going to stay with me?

337
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,920
Tam.

338
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,940
Don't forget to find a picture of your grandma.

339
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
Otherwise, we won't print the funeral photo in time.

340
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,390
Yes.

341
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,660
But...

342
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,140
Grandma didn't take many photos.

343
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,630
(The reason why I chose you was because it felt right.)

344
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,380
(Doesn't matter that you're abandoned,)

345
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,290
(you're now my grandchild.)

346
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,660
(Your name is Tam from now on.)

347
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,130
Stay with me, Tam.

348
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,920
You must listen to my word from now on, alright?

349
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,360
Yes.

350
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,140
Tam.

351
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,800
I sorted it out with the temple.

352
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Let's go send Grandma on her way.

353
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,030
Why did I care for the one who chose to cut me out

354
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,160
and left Grandma alone?

355
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,850
I shouldn't have done that to Grandma.

356
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,900
We didn't know what would happen.

357
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
But trust me, Tam,

358
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,570
that what you've done for others

359
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,070
were all done in your best effort.

360
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,140
But in the end

361
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,160
I don't have anyone left, Kong.

362
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,570
I

363
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,880
I don't have anyone left.

364
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,480
If the reason why you went to see your mother

365
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,680
because you wanted to know if anyone actually loves you,

366
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,350
then don't go looking for love anymore.

367
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,530
You have me.

368
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,440
I do.

369
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,610
I do love you all along.

370
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,380
Don't go chasing for love anymore.

371
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,300
Why did you call us out?

372
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,420
Tam's grandma passed away.

373
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,630
Is there anything I can help?

374
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,610
I contacted the temple.

375
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,280
Tam's inviting her family to the ceremony.

376
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,160
Please show Tam some support.

377
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,410
You've been gone from Tam too, haven't you?

378
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,860
I was busy caring for someone else

379
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,950
and forgot about the one close to me.

380
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,290
You should have texted us.

381
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,120
We would have gone straight to the temple.

382
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
I could have done that.

383
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,550
But someone wants to talk to you guys.

384
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Have you found Mink?

385
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,380
How is Mink doing?

386
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,560
What about Karn?

387
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,870
Did she report the evidence about Karn to the police already?

388
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,790
Mink is safe.

389
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,330
Everything's alright.

390
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,910
But some details are not very decent.

391
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,910
Why don't you spill it?

392
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,310
Why can't we know?

393
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,850
Mink and Karn just want to beat each other.

394
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,320
Everything they told you two is probably not true.

395
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,890
A damn game?

396
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,950
How can a person be so crooked?

397
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,260
Can one really play with others' feelings like that?

398
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,410
I'll get her to return your bracelets.

399
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,410
I'll have her apologize to you guys.

400
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,980
You have my words.

401
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,700
This feels like that night of our last party.

402
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,730
That the miserable things just wouldn't end here.

403
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,750
(I need no more than two hours.)

404
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,250
(Let's meet at the club.)

405
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,710
Top.

406
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,470
I told you not to come today.

407
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,530
Don't you think I'd miss you?

408
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,910
Especially when you're going through hardship.

409
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,670
How can I leave you alone?

410
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,730
Kul.

411
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,400
If I manage to rip some money off my dad,

412
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,720
shall we go study abroad together?

413
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,640
Let's get 20 or 30 millions.

414
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Then let's live there together.

415
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,380
Let's not have my dad bossing me around.

416
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,020
I don't want to live like this anymore, Kul.

417
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Do you understand me?

418
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,320
Calm down.

419
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,500
I understand that you're under stress these days.

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,610
But if you manage to overcome the problems,

421
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,810
your life will become much better.

422
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,500
Just hold out a little longer.

423
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
Let's talk about that some other time.

424
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,390
I'm tired, Kul.

425
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,390
I want to be free.

426
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,650
Let's talk about it when you're sober.

427
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,870
For real, Kul.

428
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,120
If we can live together abroad,

429
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
everything will work out.

430
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,320
Because I really love you.

431
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,710
I want you to live comfortably.

432
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,590
I love you.

433
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,180
Don't you worry,

434
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,640
I'll always be by your side.

435
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,180
Top.

436
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,690
Top.

437
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,740
Top.

438
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,510
Top.

439
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,880
(Send me some more of Kul's pictures.)

440
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,450
(I'm in the mood.)

441
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,890
(Super Hot 18+)

442
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,530
(My boy. Super hot.)

443
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,430
(Give me a price if you want some.)

444
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,930
Bastard.

445
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,850
I almost felt sorry for you.

446
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,610
You're done for.

447
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,450
What the hell is this?

448
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,680
My phone.

449
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,670
Kul, you bastard.

450
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,460
My dad's going to screw me over.

451
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,470
(Somsak.)

452
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,790
You guys, go get Kul.

453
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,260
He stole an important video.

454
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
We're all going to be screwed.

455
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,850
What the hell is this smell?

456
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,050
(Delete information on the lost device.)

457
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,830
(Delete information on the lost device.)

458
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,830
Max's video.

459
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,160
(1,629 Pictures, 241 Videos, Synced just now.)

460
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,230
(No item.)

461
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,110
There's nothing.

462
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,020
(Deleted.)

463
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,400
No worries, I've uploaded it for all of you.

464
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,040
Kong.

465
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,800
Where's the gun you took from me?

466
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,490
In the drawer upstairs.

467
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,830
Damn it.

468
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,180
Get down.

469
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,240
Get down.

470
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,850
Otherwise, Kul is dead.

471
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,080
Get down.

472
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Don't fool around.

473
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,590
Get on your knees.

474
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,050
Put your hands on your head.

475
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,050
Give me Top's phone.

476
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,850
Quick!

477
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,550
Hey!

478
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,550
Give me your phone.

479
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,310
Quick!

480
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,190
Get up.

481
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,880
Walk.

482
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,360
Let go of Kul.

483
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,770
Or you're dead.

484
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,280
It's not worth it.

485
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,200
Why would you trade your life serving a bastard?

486
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,610
Put your gun down.

487
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,750
And the phone.

488
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,250
Quick!

489
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,890
Quick!

490
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,340
Max is chasing them.

491
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,230
Please help Max.

492
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,820
Is anyone hurt?

493
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,730
Why did you send the video to me too?

494
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,350
(Prof. Jate.)

495
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,160
Because I think it'd be safe with you.

496
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,860
Kul.

497
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,860
Thank you for doing this.

498
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,170
Let's discharge for your safety.

499
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,790
I'll have the police take care of it from here.

500
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,400
Who's on their side?

501
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,640
I just found out

502
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,340
that he's close to Venus's son.

503
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,380
Do you ever think of proving to me that you're a man?

504
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,570
If you can't handle this,

505
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,820
Don't ever think of stepping your feet in here.

506
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,900
Venus's son.

507
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,050
The issue about your son.

508
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,650
Make sure no news is leaking

509
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,090
I don't like it when people dig up scandalous things

510
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,860
that could ruin our business.

511
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
You have my words.

512
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,180
I'll make sure he has no presence.

513
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,030
(Press Conference)
(Where all inquiries about Max Methas from Youth Club)
(and his disputant Top, Thachai's son will be revealed.)

514
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,870
Finish them at that conference.

515
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,980
But change the target a little.

516
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,120
Make it that troublemaker instead.

517
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,810
We shouldn't have let him grow up this much.

518
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,280
Venus's middle child.

519
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:55,790
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

520
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,240
Have you found the gun?

521
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,380
Where is it?

522
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,870
As you saw it.

523
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,540
Max took it.

524
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,550
What if he hurt someone someday?

525
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,470
For the worst, that person could be you.

526
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,980
(MOTHER OF MONSTERS.)

527
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,910
Kong.

528
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,300
Someone leaked a news

529
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,050
that you killed someone when you were younger.

530
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,800
I think it's the reaction when they knew we've got the videos.

531
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,480
What do we do?

532
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,500
What's in the video?

533
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,630
Why do you want to know?

534
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,050
So that I would know

535
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,200
whether my time and feelings wasted

536
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
was worth anything at all.

537
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,030
Is Gut not home yet?

538
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,120
Yeah. He doesn't answer my calls.

539
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,950
(Kul.)

540
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,980
(Help me, Kul.)

541
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,890
Are you okay, Gut?

542
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,030
Where are you?

543
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,260
(Your brother is with me.)

544
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,640
(Keep this in mind.)

545
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
(If the video gets leaked,)

546
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,870
(Your brother will be gone.)

547
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,010
(Keep this in mind.)

548
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,350
Guys.

549
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,860
I saw Kul taking Max outside.

550
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,050
We should hurry and follow them.

551
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,390
I'm afraid they'd be in danger.

552
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,520
It's you again, is it?ง

553
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,810
How could you do this to me?

554
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,650
Kul, stop!

555
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,870
How could you do this to me?

556
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,830
You've always hated me.

557
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,070
Why don't you ever blame yourself?

558
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,800
And why would I be the one to shoot?

559
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
It's because of yourself.

560
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,560
It's so fun to see losers fight among themselves.

561
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,830
It's like watching desperate dogs fighting over food.

562
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,900
Kul!

563
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,920
Do you think I want to do this?

564
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,820
There's only me who can tell you what or what not to do.

565
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,160
You got that, Kul?

566
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,630
Kong!
