1
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,404
What are you doing, Tam?

2
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:16,810
I'm packing up, grandma.

3
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,641
We have to move to the countryside tomorrow, don't we?

4
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:23,640
And do I get to go with mom or dad?

5
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:25,640
You're going with dad, right, grandma?

6
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:28,809
What's wrong, grandma?

7
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:34,101
You're not saying I have to choose by myself, right?

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,709
That'd be a tough call for me.

9
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,015
Ton gets to be with dad,

10
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,601
Tung gets to be with mom

11
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:45,637
Why should I be the one who gets to choose?

12
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,403
Your mom and dad just part ways

13
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:04,081
It's tough for both of them.

14
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,081
And...

15
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:11,816
When they're trying to settle down again

16
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:16,078
It'd be tough to bring two children along.

17
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,080
Let's wait until they're settled.

18
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:26,508
Alright?

19
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,077
Yes

20
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:32,077
It's fine.

21
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,903
You must listen to my word from now on, alright?

22
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,708
So you wouldn't be a problematic child.

23
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,901
And stay within the line.

24
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,607
Yes

25
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,001
Get down here and help me with work.

26
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,509
What on earth are you doing?

27
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:12,745
Make your life worthy of some good.

28
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,001
Don't just lie there and daydream.

29
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,001
Or watch some silly videos.

30
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,001

(I think there's one thing I should let you know.)

40
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,714
From now on, you must be careful

41
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:31,609
when you meet someone new or make new friends

42
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,404
because I'm not sure anymore

43
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,006
what else our family will be facing.

44
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,397
What do we do?

45
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:39,520
I think we should do this.

46
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,317
Let's do this.

49
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:50,501
Let's go.

50
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,363
You.

51
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,701
What was your name?

52
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:03,809
Mac.

53
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:04,807
Right.

54
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,358
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:08,954
Well,

56
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,361
just like Kong said last night.

57
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,902
We can do anything here. We can come here anytime.

58
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,183
Is that so?

59
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:19,213
You can just drop Kong some messages.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,517
Well, the thing is

61
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,517
I actually said that last night.

62
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,518
But...

63
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,721
Last night when I came back,

64
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:32,404
it was already messed up like this.

65
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:35,308
Is there anything valuable?

66
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:37,381
Should we call the cops?

67
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,406
Hey, are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,720
Are you going to call the cops on me and you for partying last night?

69
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:44,004
It's fine.

70
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,514
I didn't leave anything valuable.

71
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:49,607
Then

72
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,312
I'll help you clean it up.

73
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,404
To make up for staying the night here last night.

74
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,903
Let's do it together.

75
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,201
We partied together so we should clean up together.

76
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,505
I apologize for what happened last night.

77
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,109
Actually, I think I should apologize to everyone.

78
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:15,506
Don't you think Mac is a little strange?

79
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,606
How so?

80
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,505
Are you overthinking it?

81
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,901
I'm just questioning.

82
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:23,901
Well then,

83
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,106
are you going to go to everyone and apologize?

84
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,683
- Yeah.
- Damn, such a nice guy.

85
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,240
Isn't that the right thing to do?

86
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,376
We invited them and they had to go through something like this.

87
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:33,880
No one would be okay with that.

88
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:37,301
But I think I like those people who stayed behind last night.

89
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,401
I think they're the selected ones.

90
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:43,801
They have that devil look in their eyes.

91
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:47,803
We got into trouble right from the very first day.

92
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,975
I think you can go alone, Kong.

93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,889
See you later.

94
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,663
Hold on.

95
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,037
Are you just going to ditch me?

96
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,609
Yeah, can't help it.

97
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,278
I have someone I should apologize to as well.

98
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,767
Let's each get our redemptions done.

99
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:08,618
See you, dude.

100
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:21,031
(Tam's house)

101
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,431
(Kong: I'm here.)

102
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:36,709
What's wrong?

103
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,606
Are you disappointed that it's me?

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,302
No.

105
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:43,809
I just didn't think you would be here too.

106
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,606
That's because my guess was correct.

107
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,118
If you're going to drop by someone's,

108
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,111
the first one would be Tam.

109
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:55,003
How's that?

110
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,578
Don't I know exactly what you think?

111
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,308
Kanya.

112
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:19,401
Kanya.

113
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,902
This is my grandma.

114
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,204
So this is the friend you met up with yesterday?

115
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,386
This is Kong and May.

116
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,406
They go to the same faculty as I do, Grandma.

117
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,388
Actually

118
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,216
Actually, I have something to apologize for.

119
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:54,216
It was so much fun, grandma.

120
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:56,981
I met a lot of people yesterday.

121
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:58,981
Right?

122
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,406
Oh, yes.

123
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,506
That's right.

124
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:04,881
Community work.

125
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:08,735
I still want to apologize

126
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,969
for having a little too much fun.

127
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,358
That doesn't sound quite decent

128
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,152
the "little too much fun" part.

129
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,880
and a friend who's a man.

130
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:20,503
Men and women can never be friends.

131
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:27,812
Kanya.

132
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,812
Kanya, please.

133
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:33,518
Can't we even say hi or talk when we meet like other people do?

134
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,152
I want this to end.

135
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,204
I don't want any more trouble with my mom.

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,518
But we don't hate each other, do we, Kanya?

137
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,109
We haven't talked ever since.

138
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,705
Maybe this is how we're supposed to part.

139
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,506
We should never meet again.

140
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:56,308
So we wouldn't get hurt again.

141
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,406
Kanya, please.

142
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:00,401
Do we have to go that far?

143
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:04,535
It's better this way.

144
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:05,994
I've made up my mind.

145
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,009
Kanya

146
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:08,506
Don't be like this, Kanya.

147
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:09,415
Kanya.

148
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,471
Help!

149
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,615
- What's going on?
- Kanya!

150
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,071
Kanya!

151
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,311
Sir, stop.

152
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,013
What are you trying to do?

153
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,312
Can't we even be friends?

154
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,404
They can, actually, if they don't think of each other that way.

155
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,609
You guys are still young, what do you know?

156
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,108
Next time,

157
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,361
if you're going to come over to this house,

158
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:36,512
you have to get my permission first.

159
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:37,607
Yes.

160
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,809
Female friends only.

161
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,105
A man shouldn't come anymore.

162
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,804
And don't even think of hitting on her.

163
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:46,379
Tam is allowed to have a boyfriend

164
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:48,407
only when she's finished school.

165
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,610
Oh?

166
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,120
Don't ever let my grandma know where I've been last night.

167
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,201
Even better if you pretend nothing happened.

168
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,238
Are you living in jail?

169
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,101
This is how things go in my house.

170
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:22,702
Please understand.

171
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:24,803
Yeah.

172
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,351
Then you can't come to see Peem's audition tonight.

173
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,409
Oh?

174
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,001
Really?

175
00:10:33,373 --> 00:10:35,077
I thought we would get to go together.

176
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,601
I don't want to get into trouble.

177
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,081
Have fun on my behalf.

178
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:41,401
What a shame.

179
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:49,305
But it's good that Tam doesn't go, Kong.

180
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:50,948
You see what her grandma's like.

181
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:52,715
She wouldn't have it.

182
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,603
Do you want Tam to get scolded even more?

183
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:59,080
By the way, Kong.

184
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,404
Please tell Pali.

185
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,404
I don't think I can go tonight.

186
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,078
He invited you already?

187
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,204
Yeah.

188
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:13,401
Pali was the one who took me home last night.

189
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,078
Yeah.

190
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:41,031
(Kong: Where are you, Pali?)

191
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:48,609
Can we fall in love after a glimpse of each other's eyes?

192
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:55,200
How can people's hearts be bonded within a split of a second?

193
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:59,502
The game we played at the club that night was quite fun.

194
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,692
We could just ask anything.

195
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:03,401
Will I get to play it again today?

196
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,306
You can just ask even if we're not playing a game.

197
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,062
Why?

198
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,006
What do you want to know?

199
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:12,972
What about...

200
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:15,398
Are you seeing or talking to anyone?

201
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,105
Well.

202
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,308
This question is even tougher than playing a game.

203
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,601
Why?

204
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:22,912
Is it a secret?

205
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,278
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,278
But I think I do want someone.

207
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:30,403
What kind of person do you like?

208
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:33,314
Umm..

209
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,508
Well, I

210
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,306
I probably like a kind girl.

211
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,303
I think I have a soft spot for something like that.

212
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:44,902
Having a girl ask me like this is a little embarrassing.

213
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,127
Why are you embarrassed?

214
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,515
You're just telling me your type.

215
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,361
There are many more things to be embarrassed.

216
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:57,634
You make me want to dive deep

217
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,348
You make me want to have you in my sight

218
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,563
You make me get lost in a land

219
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:08,509
Too far to be found

220
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:14,828
And no matter how near or far

221
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:23,809
I will make it into your universe

222
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,155
Thanks for coming.

223
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:40,007
And thanks for letting me live with you.

224
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,521
(May: If you don't have enough money for rent,)

225
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,031
(Why don't we share a room?)

226
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,615
Pardon me

227
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,201
Is it okay if I speak colloquially with you?

228
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,001
Do whatever you want.

229
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,001
I'm really not bothering you, am I?

230
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,001
I don't look like a homeless, right?

231
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,308
I just want a roommate.

232
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,588
And you're not there to be my boyfriend.

233
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,588
So there's nothing bothersome about it.

234
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:42,709
Okay?

235
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,637
Sure.

236
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:49,038
I will return the best favor to make it worth your generosity.

237
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,509
Do you even know what I want?

238
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,881
I can tell even when I was on stage.

239
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,881
You almost ate Kong up alive.

240
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:02,007
Then...

241
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,409
I think I should learn to hide it better.

242
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,409
Just keep on doing it this way.

243
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,441
Just keep going.

244
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,281
I'll help you.

245
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:10,983
It's all clear as well.

246
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,803
Tam's not here.

247
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,201
You noticed that too?

248
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:20,303
The way Kong looks at Tam is just like how you look at Kong.

249
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,102
When people like you are interested in someone,

250
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,102
it's really easy to tell.

251
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,803
Should I compliment you for being smart,

252
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,701
or should I condemn you for being so nosy?

253
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:36,508
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,263
I just like to observe people.

255
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,198
It's fine.

256
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:40,958
I like it.

257
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,409
People aren't usually nice to me.

258
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:46,701
They usually want something out of me.

259
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,443
But it doesn't matter what you think of me.

260
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,443
Rest assured.

261
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:53,103
If you're sincere to me,

262
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,080
I'll be sure to repay you nicely.

263
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,404
Shop owner: You smoke?

264
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,308
I carry it around for rainy days.

265
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,317
Just like now.

266
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,758
Should I wire it to your account or your phone number?

267
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:33,952
Shop owner: What for?

268
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,606
For having my friend sing here.

269
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:44,909
Hey!

270
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:46,329
I tried sneaking out.

271
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:47,315
It was so exciting.

272
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,807
Hey! That's so cool.

273
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:50,672
Seriously though,

274
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,705
I never thought I would see you here.

275
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:01,358
By the way, where's Pali?

276
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:18,803
May I drink with you?

277
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,320
Why are you standing here all alone?

278
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,207
If you're sad,

279
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:38,207
you shouldn't just console yourself.

280
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,552
Let someone else do it.

281
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,318
That makes it go away much faster.

282
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,410
Really?

283
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:09,212
Sorry.

284
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,603
I shouldn't have done that.

285
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,709
Then I can order food from your place and get a delivery.

286
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:27,532
You sure can!

287
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,841
I will send you the menu.

288
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,109
Sure.

289
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,207
Hey! Pali!

290
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:35,803
My friend.

291
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:36,652
My bestie.

292
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,543
I thought you wouldn't show up.

293
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:38,366
I was begging for you to come.

294
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,502
Go and sit inside.

295
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:43,742
Hey! Hey! Hey!

296
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:44,918
Chill.

297
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,623
Dude.

298
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,287
What's wrong with you?

299
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,305
Heartbroken again?

300
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,241
You look like you had your heart broken.

301
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,951
You know what I think?

302
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,308
We should find someone cute to console you.

303
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,506
No, I've had enough.

304
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,318
Here me out.

305
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,318
You're about to meet someone nice.

306
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,318
And you won't be hurt anymore.

307
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:17,318
Don't you know?

308
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:19,840
Tam has a crush on you.

309
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:50,909
Tam,

310
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,609
did you lock the doors well?

311
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,708
I heard the door closing.

312
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,204
I did lock it well.

313
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:00,204
Maybe it was the wind.

314
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,240
Is there an order from a client?

315
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,812
A new one.

316
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,244
It's my friend.

317
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,609
Can I deliver this myself?

318
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,007
Why?

319
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:16,806
Is it a boy's house?

320
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,520
No, Grandma.

321
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:21,812
It's May.

322
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:23,701
Do you remember her?

323
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,321
It's her first order.

324
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:27,321
I want to impress her a little.

325
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,880
You're delivering this yourself?

326
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,263
Thank you so much.

327
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,201
Here.

328
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,561
It's me who should thank you

329
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,561
for being my excuse to leave home.

330
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,201
I was so bored staying home.

331
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,440
Your house looks so cozy.

332
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,090
I'm hungry.

333
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:48,923
Do you want to eat together?

334
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:50,004
Oh, no.

335
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:51,182
You go ahead.

336
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:52,441
How can I eat my client's food?

337
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,106
I don't want to eat alone.

338
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,921
Just think of it as dining with a friend.

339
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,801
I'm glad to meet a friend of Kong's.

340
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:02,201
Hello.

341
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:03,318
Hello.

342
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:05,361
I'm just here to deliver Kong's food.

343
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:06,512
That's so nice of you.

344
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:07,720
Thank you.

345
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:10,209
Kong doesn't have that many friends.

346
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,970
Who would have as many friends as you do, Mom?

347
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:16,901
You always have Prof. Jate by your side.

348
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:18,698
If I've guessed correctly,

349
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,477
you must be heading out to see him, right?

350
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,000
If I were dad,

351
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,000
I wouldn't be too pleased about this.

352
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,506
I don't know what you're trying to say.

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,363
It'd have been okay if you were talking only about me.

354
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,717
But you also mention Jate

355
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,361
and even say it in front of your friend.

356
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,409
I don't think that's nice.

357
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:43,911
Another thing...

358
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:49,601
For me, men and women can actually be friends.

359
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:54,969
Um...

360
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:57,412
I will excuse myself and leave now.

361
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:58,595
Goodbye.

362
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,213
Goodbye.

363
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:00,440
I'll give you a lift, Tam.

364
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,145
It's okay.

365
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:01,967
I'll leave now.

366
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,007
See you.

367
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,706
Kanya.

368
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:16,714
Kanya.

369
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,206
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:20,911
No matter how many times you apologized.

371
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,609
It wouldn't just go away.

372
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:39,926
Kanya.

373
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,111
Kanya.

374
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:44,006
Kanya.

375
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:52,797
Hey.

376
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,206
What are you doing here?

377
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:58,409
I'm here to deliver some food for Kong.

378
00:22:58,853 --> 00:22:59,982
But the atmosphere doesn't seem too great.

379
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:01,003
So I left.

380
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,198
Kong and his mother?

381
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,198
Yeah.

382
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:07,601
Hop on.

383
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:08,903
I'll give you a lift.

384
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,419
Do Kong and his mother fight often?

385
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:14,419
I can imagine how bothering it would be for him.

386
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:26,902
Here.

387
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:32,810
Does it really help?

388
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,308
It doesn't help solve the problem.

389
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:39,007
But it does help you breathe easier.

390
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:42,901
Do people name their inhalers?

391
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,231
(Levi)
Do people name their inhalers?

392
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:44,891
Do people name their inhalers?

393
00:23:45,031 --> 00:23:46,806
I gave it this name

394
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,407
because I would gain the strength to carry on after I inhale it.

395
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,404
That must have been a refreshing one.

396
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,318
Yeah.

397
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,701
Thanks.

398
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,204
Keep it here.

399
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,204
It's my present.

400
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,013
Do you have any plans after this?

401
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,308
I have to run some errands after this.

402
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:10,677
Then

403
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Can I join you on that?

404
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:25,643
By the way

405
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,112
Nothing much but

406
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:31,567
Please keep clean while living with me.

407
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:33,404
And don't go around picking things up.

408
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:50,604
Love love I Need Somebody to love

409
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,401
But That Person Must Be You

410
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:56,961
I Pray for us to be true

411
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,961
This is the love I'll never..

412
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,518
Why are you singing?

413
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:06,515
To repay you.

414
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:08,634
Thank you

415
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,634
for letting me move in here.

416
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,160
You saved my life big time.

417
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:16,320
And don't worry.

418
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:20,323
I'll do all the cleaning for you.

419
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,502
I'll do it so well

420
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:23,804
like no maids can do for you.

421
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:24,909
Okay?

422
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,558
Stop being so weird.

423
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:32,809
Fine.

424
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,563
Wait a second.

425
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:43,416
Here.

426
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:44,678
Here it is.

427
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,411
Still nice and hot.

428
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,680
But before you eat, I have a question.

429
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:54,841
If you get it right, you get the one with two eggs.

430
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:58,130
Which soup is the most nutritious?

431
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,742
Tick tock, Tick tock

432
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:06,843
You don't seem to be able to figure it out.

433
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:08,409
I will just tell you the answer.

434
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:10,231
It's a soup-permarket!

435
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:14,761
Not funny?

436
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,647
The lamest lame joke.

437
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:20,010
Stop cracking nonsense jokes.

438
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,809
You know well what I want.

439
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:25,164
Don't you worry about that.

440
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:26,403
It would definitely work out.

441
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:30,812
When people know that someone has a crush on them,

442
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,607
their focus would be shifted to that person even without them knowing.

443
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:36,905
Don't worry too much about it.

444
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,043
Alright?

445
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:40,903
You look like you're hungry.

446
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,038
Here you go.

447
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,409
Two eggs.

448
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,043
Keep them for yourself.

449
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,303
I've never been to a market like this.

450
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:02,001
Do you want to come again?

451
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:03,841
So I would have extra hands to carry stuff.

452
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:05,503
I'm always on the call.

453
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,604
Then...

454
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:09,840
Can you help me with one more thing?

455
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:10,772
Hm?

456
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,481
I've always wanted someone to help me with this.

457
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:15,201
With what?

458
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,960
It's like choosing someone else's death.

459
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,358
I can't.

460
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:23,708
Can we not do it?

461
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,709
Does that bother you?

462
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:27,988
Then it's okay.

463
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,960
I'll do it.

464
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:36,702
Um...

465
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:38,210
I'll take this one.

466
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:41,416
I don't know if it's like choosing a death for someone.

467
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,548
But shopping for fish to make food

468
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,709
is also something I can't avoid.

469
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:53,379
Oh!

470
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:54,091
Is it too hot?

471
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:54,909
It's spicy!

472
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:59,520
Didn't you say like it spicy, Pali?

473
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:02,410
You go ahead.

474
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:04,410
I don't like spicy food.

475
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:05,606
Go on.

476
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:07,909
Okay, okay.

477
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:24,603
Today was fun.

478
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:27,606
Shall we go out together again?

479
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:35,612
Let's talk about that some other time.

480
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,012
I can't really go anywhere.

481
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,010
Okay.

482
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,958
Grandma!

483
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:56,807
Grandma!

484
00:28:58,415 --> 00:28:59,502
I figured

485
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,106
that you lied about that door sound.

486
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:05,906
I've heard from Pong that you went out.

487
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:07,001
Huh?

488
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:08,680
She means well to you,

489
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:10,105
so she's telling me this.

490
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:11,926
You're really so disobedient.

491
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:13,508
Disobedient!

492
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:17,360
Can't you just behave for once?

493
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,850
Grandma!

494
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:20,823
Grandma, that's enough.

495
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:22,823
Please stop doing this to me.

496
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,554
(Let me change my answer to "yes".)

497
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,189
(Wherever you're going tonight,)

498
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:50,521
(Let me go with you.)

499
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,701
(I want to do something I've never done before.)

500
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:14,551
(Night Out)

501
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:34,375
So, how about tonight?

502
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:38,826
Want me to pick you up or you come with a Mr. Right?

503
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:40,933
No need to ask if I'm free

504
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,407
Never busy, if you wanna hang with me

505
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,738
Just ask me, ask me this

506
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:50,308
Down for a night out?

507
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:54,705
If you're lonely, you've got me around

508
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,323
Ready to do anything

509
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,874
To help you get over him

510
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:05,552
If that gets me out of this friend zone then I'm down

511
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,265
Wow~

512
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:12,410
It's so pretty.

513
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:15,708
Is it that fun?

514
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,143
That I take you out here?

515
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:17,939
Yeah.

516
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:19,809
This is already so much fun

517
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:22,678
for someone who's always been in line like me.

518
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:27,518
I've never got to live my life.

519
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,680
I've never been with

520
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,105
or tried getting into a relationship with anyone.

521
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,905
I've never done anything at all.

522
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:08,160
(Kong: I'm sorry about what happened today.)

523
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,951
(I shouldn't have done something stupid like that in front of you.)

524
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:37,640
This is also my first time doing this to anyone.

525
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:47,921
You got this wrong.

526
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,114
Are you guys free tonight?

527
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,920
I want to invite you guys to the club.

528
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,920
Think of it as just chilling around.

529
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:15,613
I'll order delivery.

530
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,012
Are you treating us?

531
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:18,121
Sure.

532
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,108
What do you feel like eating?

533
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,105
Tam,

534
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:31,918
you seem different today.

535
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,902
Did you switch up your lipstick?

536
00:33:36,543 --> 00:33:37,338
Uh

537
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:38,812
Is it...

538
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,006
Is it too bright?

539
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:45,788
Uh...

540
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:48,383
This is pretty.

541
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:51,413
Here.

542
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:52,703
Have it.

543
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:55,606
Would that be okay?

544
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,606
You don't know the first thing about makeup, do you?

545
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,201
I usually don't put on makeup.

546
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,960
I watched the video clips sometime.

547
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,206
But I couldn't really follow along.

548
00:34:14,877 --> 00:34:16,693
You're doing this for Pali, right?

549
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,023
You're so cute.

550
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:24,385
Who wouldn't like you?

551
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,586
You can talk to me about anything.

552
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,009
Girl-to-girl talk.

553
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,508
Um...

554
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,908
Implanted contraception?

555
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:38,004
You should stop thinking about what your grandma says.

556
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,109
Being a bimbo or whatever.

557
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,998
That's way too outdated.

558
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:45,120
This is actually what you should do.

559
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,121
It only takes you 15 minutes.

560
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,690
It's way better than risking yourself on something stupid.

561
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:52,103
It wouldn't hurt, right?

562
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:55,472
Only a little bit.

563
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,503
This is something we girls can do for each other.

564
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,207
Perhaps even better than teaching how to put on makeup.

565
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:18,111
You must be very good at relationships.

566
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,120
What's up, you girls?

567
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,253
Where have you been?

568
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:33,733
None of your business.

569
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:38,643
I think we've found her.

570
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,472
The scissor mouth of the group.

571
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:41,594
It's probably May.

572
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:44,598
What are you guys doing?

573
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:47,709
We're putting our heads together on what we should do.

574
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:49,701
We're thinking about doing something fun.

575
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,009
What on earth are you doing?

576
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:55,972
Are you stealing?

577
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:57,403
This is meant to be shared.

578
00:35:59,191 --> 00:35:59,933
Hey.

579
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,409
I told Kong already.

580
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,301
I want to bring it to my mum.

581
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,561
She loves it.

582
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:06,410
What the hell?

583
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:22,960
Don't forget to bring this home.

584
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,407
Thank you, sir.

585
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:28,006
Oh?

586
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:29,521
Are you hiding something from us?

587
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,102
The hell are you saying, Peem?

588
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:38,801
Is this yours?

589
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:40,401
Tam gave it to me.

590
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:48,006
Just say it.

591
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:50,103
Don't make it such a big deal.

592
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:55,905
Right.

593
00:36:57,856 --> 00:36:58,878
I think

594
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,406
Tam and I have decided on it.

595
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:15,803
I don't care

596
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,105
if it's me who initiates it.

597
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,109
But if you're not seeing anyone

598
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,601
and I'm not seeing anyone,

599
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:33,806
why don't we get to know each other better?

600
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:45,040
Tam and I have decided.

601
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,431
We're going to try learning more about each other.

602
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,600
You guys are breaking the first rule so soon.

603
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,905
I'm sure this will be fun.

604
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:09,680
Why's Kong upset?

605
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:19,440
Why do you always walk out on problems?

606
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:21,441
Why are you taking the rules so seriously?

607
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:24,812
I don't really care about the damn rule.

608
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:26,308
But you...

609
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:28,508
why don't you tell me when there's something up?

610
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,440
I thought we were close.

611
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,440
Oh.

612
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:36,903
Maybe I'm the only one to think we're close.

613
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,118
Why are you so upset?

614
00:38:45,078 --> 00:38:47,123
I'm scared you would be a jerk to Tam.

615
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,603
Like how you did to other girls.

616
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:51,711
Hey.

617
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:53,711
You see?

618
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:56,708
In the end, the one who couldn't move on is you.

619
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:03,505
You judge and think I'm a jerk just like how the others look at me.

620
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,705
Why?

621
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,807
Do I not get any chance to redeem myself?

622
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,120
Why does it have to be Tam?

623
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,120
Because she likes me.

624
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:18,902
And I like her.

625
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:21,120
Perfect.

626
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:30,106
So I wouldn't bother with your sister.

627
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,609
But if you break Tam's heart this time,

628
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:47,706
I'm not going to let it slide.

629
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:21,909
Don't over-stress yourself.

630
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,600
They're just starting.

631
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:28,906
And also, you're the one who said it

632
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,709
that you're going to keep yourself open.

633
00:40:35,521 --> 00:40:38,369
Kong, if you want to date someone,

634
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,506
can I be one of your choices?

635
00:41:22,723 --> 00:41:24,809
I'm much kinder than you think.

636
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:43,111
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

637
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,609
Does everyone like someone like Pali?

638
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,124
Someone fell for him?

639
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:53,701
Can someone who loves himself so much really love someone else?

640
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,484
If you want to go ahead,

641
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:57,123
you should try giving him love first.

642
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,311
Why are you so surprised?

643
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,798
I don't like someone so mindful about skinship.

644
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,542
Because I mind spending money when I have to.

645
00:42:14,564 --> 00:42:17,766
And now we're looking at my new car.

646
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:18,717
He seems rich,

647
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:20,503
but he really looks down on others.

648
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:22,207
I miss you.

649
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:24,604
What kind of person are you, Pali?

650
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,038
How many people have you met?

651
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:28,101
What the hell did you do?

652
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,801
I screwed it up again.
