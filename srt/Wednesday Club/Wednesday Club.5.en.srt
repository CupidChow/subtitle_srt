1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:02,389
Are you angry with me that I joined your mom's project?

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,210
Just make sure she's not using you.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,170
Max.

4
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:09,359
Why are you taking so many pictures?

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,179
Protect our safe house's secret.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,569
We're lucky.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,669
My dad's not here today.

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,619
Why did you invite me over today?

9
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,499
I will make up for how much you miss me.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,749
We've met again.

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,259
You like to miss strangers, don't you?

12
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,089
Can you help me with something?

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,569
I don't want to be alone.

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,349
Why do you have so many bruises?

15
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,270
What exactly have you been through?

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,659
What the hell?

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,429
Mink was abused by her ex-husband.

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,670
Do you know who Mink's troublesome husband is?

19
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,590
What's wrong?

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,579
Hey, enjoy eating.

21
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,749
It's on my family.

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,899
No worries.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,429
Come.

24
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,579
Cheers!

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,470
Come.

26
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,969
Hey?

27
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,809
Matching outfits?

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,259
Did you two agree in advance to wear it?

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,920
Look at him.

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,219
Look.

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,619
How can these be matching outfits?

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,009
His is fake.

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,769
I can report you for trademark violation.

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,269
I know nothing about it.

35
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,049
I don't even know it's brand-name stuff.

36
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,349
My mom just bought it for me.

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,879
That means it's genuine.

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880
That's a genuine product from a flea market.

39
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,709
Someone like you has nothing on me.

40
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,100
Loser.

41
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,490
You fake dude.

42
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,299
I think I should give you a gift.

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,809
Come.

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,810
Loser, let's take a photo.

45
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,359
Let's take a photo, guys.

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,840
Come.

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,810
Loser.

48
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:55,909
Loser!

49
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,839
You fake dude!

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,160
Hey, smile.

51
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,319
Loser!

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,929
You fake dude!

53
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,359
Loser!

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,680
You fake dude!

55
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,039
Loser!

56
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,790
You fake dude!

57
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,489
Kul, what's wrong?

58
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,490
Come out now.

59
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,089
No, Mom.

60
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,330
I don't want to stay here anymore.

61
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,619
I want to change school.

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,290
I don't want to be looked down on anymore.

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,279
(Kul: New me.)

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,190

I'm sorry.

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,169
It's my fault.

77
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,709
If I pretended to ignore her,

78
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,529
I don't know what else she's going to face.

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,019
I bet I can't sleep for many days

80
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,489
if I can't help with anything.

81
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,930
I know you're kind.

82
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
That's why I want your help.

83
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,800
Have I f**cking got anything in return for being kind?

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,899
Let's make a deal then.

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,539
Do whatever it takes.

86
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,649
Make Tam and Pali get back together.

87
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,119
Doing whatever it takes

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,140
to make Kong fall for you sounds more possible.

89
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,429
Kong will never like me.

90
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,089
If that's what you think,

91
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,880
why do you care about Tam and Pali then?

92
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,679
If I'm not happy,

93
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,139
then I don't want anyone to be happy.

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,389
Come on.

95
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,969
Decide then.

96
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,260
If you help me, I'll help you.

97
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,269
Hey, we offer service for guys, too.

98
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,519
How about having us wash and style your hair?

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,570
Now, there's no queue.

100
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,350
Come on.

101
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,229
Let's give it a try.

102
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,960
Please don't move.

103
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,859
Pali.

104
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,089
I just saw your message.

105
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,379
I thought you were here for some business,

106
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,649
but it turns out you're our customer.

107
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,019
I'll tell my mom to give you a discount.

108
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,019
Is he your friend?

109
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,970
Do it well.

110
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,370
Let's talk when you're done.

111
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,439
Nice.

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,579
Bro, try it, and you'll like this place.

113
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,579
I'm fond of a hairdresser here.

114
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,949
That's why I'm a regular customer.

115
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,269
Don't say that.

116
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,110
Every time you're here,

117
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,269
you only have me cut off a little bit.

118
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,389
Mai, coming here to have you pat my head,

119
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm already happy.

120
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,409
Where is your daughter, by the way?

121
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,710
I haven't met her for years.

122
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,229
Mink doesn't keep in touch with others much.

123
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,579
I've heard she's arguing with her husband.

124
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,729
I won't have a husband then, Mom.

125
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,729
I've seen both you and Mink.

126
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,049
I'm sick of being in love.

127
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,289
Just do your homework.

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,970
Don't mess with my business.

129
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,749
Asshole, what are you doing?

130
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,550
Pali, that jerk recorded up your mom's dress!

131
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,919
Don't be nosy!

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,199
What did you do to her?!

133
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,590
Nim!

134
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,450
Call the police now!

135
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,020
I'll put you in jail!

136
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,389
Stay away from my mom.

137
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,699
Every woman in this family is mental!

138
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,249
How could you say that to us!?

139
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,399
Why?

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,699
Because you have such a sharp tongue,

141
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,869
everyone abandoned your whole family!

142
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,560
Your family is unwanted!

143
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,200
The problem was caused by a jerk, wasn't it?

144
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,049
I'm not blaming every man,

145
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,589
but that jerk also touched my butt.

146
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,109
I won't let this slide.

147
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,989
Bro, don't ever do stuff like this to anyone.

148
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,270
Don't let anyone call you a jerk.

149
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,380
So, our whole family won't get insulted again.

150
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,169
About Tam and me, it's my fault.

151
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,509
But I really didn't do anything that night.

152
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,739
I didn't contact anyone because I was worried

153
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,059
I would say something that might hurt others again.

154
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,689
So, I want to think it over well enough.

155
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,069
I got your point,

156
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,770
but you must care about the person who's waiting, too.

157
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,140
She's also feeling a wreck.

158
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,559
All our friends hate me a lot, don't they?

159
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,819
Hey.

160
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,539
We understand it's your personal matter.

161
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,539
We won't get angry because of this.

162
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,219
But because we're friends,

163
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,800
I don't want to see this tension.

164
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,150
Well, I...

165
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,629
How about this?

166
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,160
Talk it out with Tam at Kong's party,

167
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,519
so you wouldn't have to face her alone.

168
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
If something happens,

169
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,890
we're there to help.

170
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,809
Kong really worked hard for this party.

171
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,640
He wants all of us to be there.

172
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,969
Honestly,

173
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,690
I want you two to get back to talking.

174
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,859
If someone like you has Tam in your life,

175
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,740
I believe you can be happy.

176
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,370
I'm supporting you two.

177
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,489
By the way, you have an older sister, too?

178
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,129
Yeah.

179
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,949
We're not very close.

180
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,369
Huge age difference, you know.

181
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,939
Why?

182
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,150
Nothing. I'm just asking.

183
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,670
You're already feeling okay, right?

184
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,799
I don't want you to feel lonely in the room alone.

185
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,209
Eat and then go back later.

186
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,310
I'll finish my work and hurry back.

187
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,500
Thank you so much, Peem,

188
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,750
for taking care of me this much.

189
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,239
So what are you going to do about this?

190
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,569
I'm now gathering evidence to sue him.

191
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,229
If I have enough evidence,

192
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,279
this whole thing will end.

193
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,279
He'll be put in jail.

194
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,740
Then, I can finally live a peaceful life.

195
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,399
I know this issue is very serious and risky,

196
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,099
but if I'm willing to help someone,

197
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
I'll surely do my best.

198
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,279
I've never met such a kind guy like you before.

199
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
How unlucky my life is.

200
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,859
If I had met such a good guy like you,

201
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,790
my life wouldn't have been hurt the way I've been through.

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,589
You've found me now.

203
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,590
I'm right here for you.

204
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,659
No matter what you've been through, '

205
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
we've found each other now.

206
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,569
(Please upload your clips often.)

207
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,209
(Seeing your smile gives me the energy to live my life.)

208
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,990
(I don't have money, so I'll let Kul show me how to spend.)

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,189
This car is 3 million baht.

210
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,909
10 million baht for the watch.

211
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,999
20,000 THB for this shirt

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,049
and 9,000 THB for trousers.

213
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,299
These shoes cost 10,000 THB.

214
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,450
And this smile of mine is priceless.

215
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,299
(Kul is super handsome.)

216
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,949
(Everything you own from head to toe is expensive.)

217
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,549
This car is fantastic.

218
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,959
Ever since I've got it,

219
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,679
I'm never afraid of driving a long distance.

220
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,059
(A self-made teen like me is so envious that your family has made money for your future.)

221
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,670
Most importantly,

222
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,239
this car has brought me to see this beautiful scenery.

223
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,259
How is it?

224
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,200
Beautiful, isn't it?

225
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,839
(Your car is so beautiful. Making travel content is a must now.) (Kul, please drive and take us on a trip.)

226
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,809
If you want to see my traveling video,

227
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,220
or if any client would like to sponsor my clip,

228
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,220
please drop your message in my inbox.

229
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,279
(I'm interested in hiring you to make a traveling video with your car.)

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,870
(I'll drop my message in your inbox.)

231
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,839
Kul.

232
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,120
Babe, I missed you so much.

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,719
Eh? Why are you dressed up so modestly?

234
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Come. Let me unbutton it for you.

235
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,479
We've just met.

236
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,390
I miss you again.

237
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,800
Cheers.

238
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,239
Do you remember him?

239
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,469
Of course.

240
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,280
Kul, you're so cute.

241
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,339
You're cute too, Bom.

242
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,190
What did you do?'

243
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,820
Why are you more beautiful now?

244
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,499
Oops. Thank you.

245
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,079
You remember me?

246
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,249
Of course.

247
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,399
I remember everyone who took care of me.

248
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,739
Since you're this cute,

249
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,419
I'll make you remember me so well

250
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,950
that you see me in your dream.

251
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,129
How cute.

252
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,029
Hey, guys.

253
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,849
Let's record our clip now

254
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,119
before you all get even more drunk.

255
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
The vibe is just right now.

256
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,969
Kul, don't focus on others.

257
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,389
No swinging.

258
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,299
Do it with me only.

259
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,009
Also, don't let your face be seen clearly.

260
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,379
I don't want others to see you much.

261
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,559
Or else you can't be in other clips.

262
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,749
What are you talking about?

263
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,520
What are we filming?

264
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,359
Again?!

265
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,289
Why do you always have problems understanding your job?

266
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,739
I paid you as much as 100,000 THB for today

267
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,939
to film a clip for my secret sex group.

268
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,130
You can't have any problem with this.

269
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,149
What secret group?

270
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,569
Who did you make this deal with?

271
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,799
What?!

272
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,919
Your agent, of course.

273
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,629
That girl named Yam.

274
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,679
I told her the brief in detail

275
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,600
that it would be a group sex party by the pool.

276
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,469
Or do I have to show you the storyboard, Kul?

277
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,199
I really know nothing about this.

278
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,009
She told me it would be just a party by the poor

279
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,029
and I'd be taking off my shirt being your escort boy for 4 hours.

280
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,239
Are you cheating?!

281
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,329
Of course, I'm not.

282
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,180
How can I?

283
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,319
That girl is cheating me out of money too.

284
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,140
I don't care.

285
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,249
Since you're already here, you must do your job

286
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,279
and clear things up with whoever your agent is later.

287
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,579
Stop talking

288
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,579
because it's wasting my time.

289
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,280
Sit.

290
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:24,449
I told you I won't do it.

291
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,859
I'm not accepting any sex job.

292
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,449
But you already took my money!

293
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,340
I told you I didn't get the money!

294
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,259
So what's now?

295
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,489
Will you do your job or not?

296
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,480
If you won't do it, get out.

297
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,470
Fine. I won't do it.

298
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,619
Wait.

299
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,029
Come here.

300
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,279
Give me back everything I gave you,

301
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,670
including the car.

302
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,519
Well, I already accepted a job from the client.

303
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,410
I have to film with that car.

304
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:49,179
You care about others,

305
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,449
but treat me like shit!

306
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,999
I don't give a shit about that.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,849
If you screw it up, it's your business!

308
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,850
Give me the key.

309
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
That's not it.

310
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,889
Give me back 100,000 THB I paid for today.

311
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,469
I told you I haven't received any money!

312
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,929
She didn't transfer it to me!

313
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,269
I'm giving you three days.

314
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,359
If you don't come up with money to repay me,

315
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,719
you're in trouble.

316
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,129
Someone like me can put you on a blacklist

317
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,970
and you'll never get an escort job from anywhere again.

318
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,380
(What?)

319
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,019
Did you mess with my money, Yam?!

320
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,760
How many times have you done this, huh?

321
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,540
Damn it!

322
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,479
Tam!

323
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,930
Tam.

324
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,730
Grandma, what is it again?

325
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,600
Come here!

326
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,290
Come here!

327
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,389
What?

328
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,419
What did you do, huh?

329
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,410
You never listened to me.

330
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,200
Did someone tell you something again?

331
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,699
What's wrong with you?!

332
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,069
You already have a boyfriend, right?!

333
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,970
No.

334
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,560
What are you talking about?

335
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,569
Who told you?

336
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,019
Pong told me everything.

337
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,590
You sneaked out at night often

338
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,439
and went with a boy.

339
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,189
You never listened to what I told you not to do, right?!

340
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,100
Who's he?

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,090
What's his name?

342
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,219
How far have you two gone, huh?

343
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,179
Why are really a chip off the old block?

344
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,519
Why do you behave so much like your mom?!

345
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,270
Why?!

346
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,449
Why did you talk about Mom like that?

347
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,739
You always say something bad about her!

348
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,089
Is this the reason my parents divorced?

349
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,499
Don't change the subject!

350
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,140
You never listened to me.

351
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,990
You keep arguing.

352
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,019
What do you know, huh?

353
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,589
Fine.

354
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,509
I don't know anything as well as you do!

355
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,089
Whatever I do is wrong!

356
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,889
But keep this in mind.

357
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,780
You keep scolding me every day,

358
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,749
and do you see how suffering I am?

359
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,660
It's all because of you!

360
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,276
It's all because of you, Grandma!

361
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,129
I'm like this because of you! Don't you know?!

362
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,419
You don't want me to live in this house anymore, right?!

363
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,390
Fine. I'm not living here anymore!

364
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,519
Fine. Just go!

365
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,569
Get out!

366
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,389
If you think you're strong enough,

367
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,829
just go!

368
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,740
Don't ever come back!

369
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Hey? Tam?

370
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,810
I didn't know you're here.

371
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,869
Are you still sad about Pali?

372
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,220
That's part of it.

373
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,840
But it's also because of something else.

374
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,999
You're here to prepare for the party, right?

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,139
Let me know if you need anything.

376
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,910
I'll help.

377
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,790
It's alright, Tam.

378
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,370
It's alright.

379
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,390
I'll handle it myself.

380
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,899
Look at those dark circles.

381
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
You didn't take any rest, right?

382
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,690
Tam,

383
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,369
if you feel uneasy about anything,

384
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,370
let me know.

385
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,370
Thank you.

386
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,740
I don't know why I feel

387
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,950
I'm not part of my family.

388
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,970
I know how it feels, Tam.

389
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
I really do.

390
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,009
But I want you to know that

391
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,589
you aren't alone in this world.

392
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,190
You have me.

393
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,339
I mean,

394
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,999
you have me and other friends.

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Many of us are ready to stay by your side.

396
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,229
I think you're too tired.

397
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,230
Take some rest, okay?

398
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,590
Hey, I bought this thing.

399
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
What is it?

400
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,799
Are you ready?

401
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,110
Three, two, one.

402
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,379
Wow.

403
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,760
How do you like it?

404
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,499
Beautiful?

405
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,890
It is.

406
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,709
I plan to put it here

407
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,009
in case anyone wants to lie down,

408
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,329
chill out, and watch the stars.

409
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,170
Or you can name those stars like you enjoy doing, Tam.

410
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,049
I'll name that star Tam.

411
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,789
Can I just name it like this?

412
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,420
So I can move and live there.

413
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,570
Kong.

414
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:40,229
They already delivered drinks and ice for us.

415
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,319
Anything else to prepare?

416
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,629
That's it.

417
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,539
I'll take care of the rest myself.

418
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,619
As for you, don't do anything anymore.

419
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,819
I bring you here to have fun,

420
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,329
not to give you labor jobs.

421
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,459
No worries.

422
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,250
I'm good at labor jobs.

423
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,249
Don't think too much.

424
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,320
Kul is always bad-mouthing, you know.

425
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,339
I'm sorry, but the party starts at 7 PM.

426
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,780
See you later.

427
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,970
- Whoa. There he is. - Why are you here?

428
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,819
You don't belong here.

429
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,679
Come on, Max.

430
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,819
How dare you said that?

431
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,289
When have you become superior to us, badass twin brothers?

432
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,559
Because you've been funded by his mom,

433
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,920
now you see yourself as an upper-class boy?

434
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,449
I'm stopping you because I know

435
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,380
people here don't have fun the way we do.

436
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,030
I'm just helping them here.

437
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,169
I just want to see

438
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,679
how others my age enjoy their lives.

439
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,130
Can't I just come to have a look?

440
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,589
But you need to buy a ticket.

441
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,799
It's 500 THB.

442
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,269
What?

443
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,649
Why on earth does it cost that much?

444
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,200
That amount can last for our entire week.

445
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,049
Hey? Your friends?

446
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,109
Just join us.

447
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,920
You don't need to pay.

448
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,909
Kul just overpriced the ticket.

449
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,420
Just have fun with us.

450
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,420
Do you think it's a good idea?

451
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,019
Your friends are my friends, you know.

452
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,799
Let's go all out.

453
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,959
He said that.

454
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,559
That's how you should be.

455
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,649
Okay?

456
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,649
I'm warning you now.

457
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,419
Don't ever cause any trouble here.

458
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,969
Got it?

459
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,039
You're being strict, aren't you?

460
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,219
Noted.

461
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,480
Sure, bro.

462
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Sit there.

463
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,060
Don't be afraid of anything.

464
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,919
I'll help you today.

465
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
This thing has to end.

466
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,100
And it has to end with you being happy.

467
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,070
Talk to Tam.

468
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,019
Tam, let's talk after the party.

469
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,880
I don't want to ruin the atmosphere of Kong's party.

470
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,759
I know Kong has put his all into it.

471
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,160
Sure.

472
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,040
I also don't want others to pay attention to us now.

473
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,379
Kong, why did you pick this theme?

474
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,739
Either knowing or not,

475
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,779
I bet all of us robbed something from someone at least once.

476
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Feelings aren't an exception either.

477
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,350
Guys,

478
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,359
let's have a blast tonight.

479
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,039
Forget the world outside.

480
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,819
Don't give a shit about anything.

481
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,249
Here, we can be anything

482
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,919
we want.

483
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
Bottoms up!

484
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,129
(Karn: Are you partying with your friends?)

485
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,199
(It looks fun.)

486
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
(Can I drop by to see you?)

487
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,790
(Mrs. Venus: Are there any strangers at the party?)

488
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,310
(Mostly, they invited friends of their friends.)

489
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,169
Why are you taking so many photos, Max?

490
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,599
I know you're lurking in girls.

491
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,949
So many beautiful girls here.

492
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,639
They're wearing sexy clothes too.

493
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,949
She's your type, isn't she?

494
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,569
You're right.

495
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,569
I'm just taking photos of the party.

496
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,569
Stop those disgusting thoughts already.

497
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,169
It's their right to wear whatever they want.

498
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,069
You're being serious.

499
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,410
Damn.

500
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,440
Hey, you're here to work, aren't you?

501
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,129
Why are you talking too much?

502
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,559
Do your waiter job well.

503
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,639
Look at you.

504
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,739
You guys have a dress code.

505
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,500
A thief boss and the minion twins.

506
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,430
What about you?

507
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,390
What is your dress code?

508
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,869
Why are you so foul-mouthed?

509
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,919
Hey, bring it on.

510
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,439
Hey, take it easy.

511
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,130
It's Kong's party.

512
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,229
I told you.

513
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,399
Kong's family treats me so well.

514
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,639
Stop stirring up trouble here.

515
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,309
Don't you think that

516
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,819
doing this makes you look even more pitiful?

517
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,340
Does anyone here respect you, huh?

518
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,190
What a fool.

519
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,230
(Despite everything I do)

520
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,589
(Except saying those words)

521
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,229
(Don't you know)

522
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,659
Hey.

523
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,129
Why are you here?

524
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,529
They sell the tickets.

525
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,320
Anyone can come, right?

526
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,709
(Don't you know that I)

527
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:47,099
(Am that friend who wants to be more)

528
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,839
(Answer me this for once)

529
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,920
(What am I feeling in the core)

530
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,969
Here you are.

531
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,490
My billionaire friend.

532
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,739
Why haven't we talked much,

533
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
while, actually, we could become close?

534
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,669
Why?

535
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,139
Give me a reason.

536
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,559
I've seen that you like to spend money without thinking,

537
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,390
and I'm someone who can do anything for money.

538
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,029
Do you want to play with me?

539
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,459
Nonsense.

540
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,639
What?

541
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,829
How do you know it's nonsense?

542
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,269
You never try,

543
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,979
so you won't know.

544
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
Playing with me is fun.

545
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,999
Fine.

546
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,380
If you're so hungry for my money,

547
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,359
Let's play a game.

548
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,490
I want to know who can take how much as a prize.

549
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,809
If you think you're a good robber,

550
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,640
go ahead.

551
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,280
Start.

552
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:27,120
Drink it.

553
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,810
That's all you can do?

554
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,269
What a subpar.

555
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,209
You aren't looking as serious as when you challenged me.

556
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:43,150
Drink it.

557
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,199
That's not it.

558
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,610
One more.

559
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,360
Drink it.

560
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:58,019
Drink more.

561
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,790
Drink it.

562
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:10,250
Drink it.

563
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,100
Continue.

564
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,829
Are you okay?

565
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,180
Stop already.

566
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Just give it back to me.

567
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,450
I won't.

568
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,490
Tam.

569
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,520
Let's talk outside.

570
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,070
Asshole, come!

571
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,129
Come! Asshole!

572
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,410
Let go of me!

573
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,379
Where's my watch?

574
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,160
Come here!

575
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:57,109
Kul!

576
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,660
Hey.

577
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,789
Hey, relax.

578
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,299
Do you know how much my watch is?!

579
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,960
So what?

580
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:03,179
I don't know. I didn't steal it!

581
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,060
Stop!

582
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:05,579
Asshole, my brother didn't steal it!

583
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,209
He didn't?

584
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,669
You guys were the only ones

585
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,909
who went to the restroom after me.

586
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,159
Who else could it be?!

587
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,020
I told you to let them pay for the tickets

588
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:14,650
to filter people.

589
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,930
I don't know.

590
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,740
I'll frisk everyone,

591
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:18,140
including you, Max.

592
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,189
Why are you targeting only us?

593
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,269
Are we the only ones who're wrong?

594
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,529
Are we the only ones who can rob?

595
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,490
Why?!

596
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,489
Because I'm poor?

597
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,180
Just because I'm poor,

598
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,199
I seem to be a bad guy?

599
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,920
Is that it?

600
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,730
I lost my stuff.

601
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,720
Don't I have the right to make a fuss, huh?

602
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,330
Asshole!

603
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:33,089
Stop!

604
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,000
Turn off the music!

605
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,269
Shut the door now!

606
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,709
I'll frisk everyone.

607
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,880
I'll do the same to all!

608
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,499
Make it fair.

609
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,279
Don't let me know you're siding with someone.

610
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,659
If you want it fair, I'll frisk you too.

611
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,570
Shit. What's with you?

612
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:49,600
To prove that you aren't slandering anyone.

613
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,020
Fine.

614
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:54,849
But don't let me find out that you're wearing my watch.

615
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,029
You have gone too far!

616
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,030
Asshole.

617
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,060
I don't care.

618
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,739
I'll put whoever did this in jail.

619
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,820
Hey.

620
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,339
Everyone, open your bag and take all your stuff out.

621
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,439
Show your trousers and shirt pockets too.

622
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,810
To get over with it.

623
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,969
What right do you have to frisk me?

624
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,719
Why are we the suspects,

625
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,909
while the whole problem is because of you guys?

626
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,289
What Kul said is right.

627
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,389
Whoever Kong allowed inside with no ticket is the suspect.

628
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,139
They planned to steal our stuff here.

629
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,399
I can't stand you any longer, asshole.

630
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,880
Stop already!

631
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,289
How much is your watch?

632
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,569
You want my money so much, don't you?

633
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,190
Take my money and buy it.

634
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,999
May,

635
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,239
stop doing like this already.

636
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,040
Your money can't solve this problem.

637
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,599
Do you see any other solution?

638
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,599
Or should you take off your watch and give it to Kul?

639
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,289
Go ahead.

640
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,660
You like being a hero, don't you?

641
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,769
Who is actually a robber here, huh?

642
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,450
Nosy!

643
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,229
Hey, stop.

644
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,949
If we can't talk it out here,

645
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,189
let's talk at the police station.

646
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,329
I'll call the police to arrest all of you.

647
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,979
Let's all get in trouble!

648
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,739
Why must we get in trouble with you guys, huh?

649
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,269
Hey, I found it.

650
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,860
It dropped near the bin behind the club.

651
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,170
Damn it.

652
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:33,840
Why does it have so many scratches?

653
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,450
Lucky enough, you didn't lose it.

654
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,679
Don't let me find out who did this.

655
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,480
You're surely done for.

656
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,680
This is surely not the end.

657
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,280
Why?

658
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,540
Is seeing me and talking to me that hard for you?

659
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,329
I just wanted to think it over.

660
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,729
I wanted us to take time to think about it,

661
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,840
so we won't let our emotions take over.

662
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:50,480
I've thought it over pretty much.

663
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,480
Pali.

664
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,600
I want to start over

665
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,170
with you, Pali.

666
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,989
I don't care

667
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,049
who you were in the past.

668
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,150
If you're ready,

669
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm also ready to start over today.

670
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,430
Let's start this over together.

671
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,630
Pali.

672
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,259
Kanya?

673
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,289
Why are you here?

674
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,189
I know both Kong and you are here,

675
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,089
so I want to talk about this together.

676
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,210
I want us to start over.

677
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,230
Wait.

678
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,230
What's this?

679
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,299
Pali,

680
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,910
does she know about us?

681
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,310
Us?

682
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:59,870
Pali, are you bringing your new girl to talk it out with me?

683
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,570
No.

684
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,199
It's not like that, Tam.

685
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,099
Kanya,

686
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,849
what are you doing here?

687
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:12,169
Kong, I just want to tell you in person.

688
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,969
I won't care how Mom controls me anymore.

689
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,220
I'll get back together with Pali.

690
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,650
Get back together?

691
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,740
What about me?

692
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,920
Where am I in this whole story?

693
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,550
Kong, you told me Pali isn't dating anyone.

694
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,450
This is Kanya, my sister.

695
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,799
Pali and Kanya were in a relationship before.

696
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,250
I told Kanya that

697
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,260
because I didn't expect this would happen, Tam.

698
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,600
If Kanya wasn't here yet,

699
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,519
what would you say to me, Pali?

700
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,220
Say it now.

701
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,730
Just say it.

702
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,560
Do you want to see my heart break and me die in front of you?

703
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,490
I'm sorry.

704
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,619
I admit

705
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,079
the whole thing that happened is my fault.

706
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,779
I felt totally disappointed because of what happened between Kanya and me,

707
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,579
so I've been trying to do everything

708
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
to find someone to replace her.

709
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
You're also one of them, Tam.

710
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,079
But honestly,

711
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,819
when we were talking,

712
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,089
I never cheated on you.

713
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,189
As soon as I saw you hurt,

714
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,610
I realized I had slipped up.

715
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,770
I'll face the truth.

716
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,349
I can't forget Kanya.

717
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,380
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore,

718
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,470
especially you, Tam.

719
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,110
That's why I want to tell you that

720
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,840
I'll end it here.

721
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,280
I can't hurt anyone any further.

722
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,580
So, are you saying

723
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,740
you're getting back together with Kanya?

724
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,170
Asshole.

725
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,650
When will you stop behaving like this?

726
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,330
How many more girls will be hurt because of you?

727
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,029
You're damn selfish.

728
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,100
All of us mean well to you, but you totally ruined it.

729
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,860
I admit that.

730
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,650
Everything you guys said is true.

731
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,640
It's alright, Peem.

732
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,340
I know this relationship won't last anyway.

733
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,370
Ending it now is better.

734
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,400
Are you confident

735
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
you won't hurt her again?

736
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,809
Say it!

737
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,909
Give your promise.

738
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,170
Nobody should be hurt because of you anymore, Pali.

739
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,279
I promise

740
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,279
I'll do my best.

741
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,419
I'll take responsibility for others' feelings.

742
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,420
I will stop being weak.

743
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,989
I won't be selfish.

744
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,020
I promise I'll do it.

745
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,899
Hey,

746
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,229
where is Mink?

747
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,920
I don't know.

748
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:40,759
I'm looking for her.

749
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,710
Her ex-husband is here. I saw him.

750
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,550
Damn it.

751
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,870
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

752
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,559
Have you talked to Pali?

753
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,640
Not yet.

754
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,829
Why do I have to go through something like this?

755
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,450
I care about you.

756
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,480
If you really have feelings for Mink,

757
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,929
I don't think it's going to be worth it.

758
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,789
Why don't you just tell her

759
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,129
that you're not going to take her with you?

760
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,060
What are you holding your tongue for?

761
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,060
Tam.

762
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:42,629
So it's probably just me

763
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,869
who loves Dad and Grandma.

764
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,319
Haven't you talked to Mom recently?

765
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,839
This house's getting expropriated.

766
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,719
The money we'll get probably won't get us a new house.

767
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,469
35,000 Baht for a day of rent?

768
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,399
You've upgraded to renting luxury cars already?

769
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,919
Are you not going to rent?

770
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,890
You don't like it?

771
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:00,250
Or do you not have enough money?

772
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,329
A little accident happened to the watch you lent me.

773
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,009
You call this 'a little accident'?

774
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,139
I told you how much this cost, haven't I?

775
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,719
If there is any way I can repay for it,

776
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,050
I'm in.

777
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,839
If you want my help,

778
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,110
then it's as I've always asked you.

779
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,499
If you say yes,

780
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,869
you'll be well off for the rest of your life.

781
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,379
What will it be?

782
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,059
Will you pay for the damage

783
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,690
or agree to my offer?
