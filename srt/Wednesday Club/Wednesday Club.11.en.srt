1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,129
Will she hug me

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,129
when I tell her I'm her daughter?

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,589
Mom!

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,659
Did you have fun at school?

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,429
Auntie.

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,119
Do you only have one daughter?

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,439
I only have one.

8
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,920
I almost exhausted myself to death, getting ready to have her.

9
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,119
This is what I wanted to do.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,080
The patient was in shock.

11
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,360
Grandma!

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,969
Not today.

13
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,619
(I need no more than two hours.)

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,949
(Let's meet at the club.)

15
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,430
Top.

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,779
You guys, go get Kul.

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,169
He stole an important video.

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,449
We're all going to be screwed.

19
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,979
Max's video.

20
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,950
There's nothing.

21
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,950
No worries, I've uploaded it for all of you.

22
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,269
Give me Top's phone.

23
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,080
Quick!

24
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:46,129
Hey.

25
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,199
Let go of Kul.

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,410
Or you're dead.

27
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,649
Finish them at that conference.

28
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,869
But change the target a little.

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,980
Venus's middle child.

30
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,059
Grandma, I know that

31
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,159
throughout the time we were together,

32
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,300
we both kept making each other feel uneasy.

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,150
Ouch!

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,010
Grandma!

35
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:30,919
I figured that you lied.

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,849
You went out.

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,329
You already have a boyfriend, right?

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,220
Who's he?

39
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,539
Why do you behave so much like your mom?!

40
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,539
Why did you talk about Mom like that?

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,549
You always say something bad about her!

42
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,549
What do you know, huh?

43
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,549
It's all because of you!

44
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,309
I don't even want to live in this house.

45
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,539
I didn't even want to be born.

46
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
Tam!

47
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,579
Grandma!

48
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,259
I understand that you always meant well to me,

49
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,779
but I just want you to know that

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,279
I'll take care of myself

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,649
and live a good life.

52
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,270
I won't make you worry.

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,239
If something is ruined,

54
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
Pali.

55
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,560
I'll get back together with Pali.

56
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,850
Getting back together?

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,960
What about me?

58
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,049
Where am I in this whole story?

59
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,980
It's what makes me learn a lesson.

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
Thank you for the kindness

61
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,969
you have given someone like me until today.

62
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,309
One day, we'll get to meet somewhere in one life.

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,579
Grandma, if you remember me,

64
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
smile at me.

65
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,430
Grandma, see?

66
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,270
I have many friends.

67
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,100
Don't worry about me anymore.

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,489
Congratulations on your relationship with Tam,

69
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,914
though you ended up with her

70
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,759
during quite a distressing situation like this.

71
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,880
Hey.

72
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,760
You don't have to feel guilty every time you can't do something.

73
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,209
Honestly,

74
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,179
it will be nice if at least one of us can get the hope fulfilled,

75
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,440
so we won't owe each other anything before we die.

76
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,299
Thanks a lot.

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,589
But I've heard

78
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,879
you've also been through many awful things.

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
Nothing is worse than what happened to my dad.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,649
Have you found the gun?

81
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,129
Where is it?

82
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,709
As you saw it,

83
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,710
Max took it.

84
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,230
Hey.

85
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,139
Let go of Kul.

86
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,499
But I've asked Max recently.

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,499
He told me it's not with him anymore.

88
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,299
Kong, you told me not to have the gun with me

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,689
because it's dangerous.

90
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,829
But after you took it,

91
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,039
you couldn't take care of it?

92
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,039
Be serious about it, will you?

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,530
What if one day, it comes back and hurts one of us?

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,920
For the worst, that person could be you.

95
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,350
It's for me?

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Kong.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,030

Where the hell is it?

108
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,639
Max said he accidentally dropped it

109
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,509
while things were in chaos.

110
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,869
Nobody paid attention to it either,

111
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,229
so I think it must be around here.

112
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,339
But I already searched all over.

113
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,449
Or did someone take it already?

114
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,989
It could be Top's men.

115
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,329
They might want to use it to get back at us.

116
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,369
Shit.

117
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,490
I was so damn careless.

118
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,900
Where are Max and Kul now?

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,289
I don't know.

120
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,289
I asked Mom to take care of them for me.

121
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,959
She said someone is taking care of them.

122
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,469
I'm pretty sure they're safe.

123
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,010
Safe?

124
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,799
How can you be sure?

125
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,889
Now, we're in the game with a psycho who has power.

126
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,459
He now wants to destroy you, too.

127
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,450
I know,

128
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,129
but I don't want Mom to worry about me.

129
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,699
Don't tell anyone about this.

130
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,519
I don't want her to stop everything she's doing

131
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,220
just because she's worried about me.

132
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,240
Fine.

133
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:27,200
But now I'm worried about you.

134
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,190
Honestly, I'm also scared,

135
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,730
but I just believe that we'll get through this

136
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,730
because I have you.

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,690
(A young murderer)

138
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:58,152
(She killed her own baby.)

139
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:58,565
(Go to jail!)

140
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,019
(We don't want a murderer.)

141
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,848
(We demand justice.)

142
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,716
(Mother of Monsters)

143
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,628

Kanya.

145
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,470
Kong.

146
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,860
Kong.

147
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,159
Someone leaked the news that

148
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,729
you killed someone when you were younger.

149
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,889
They also posted about me once having an abortion.

150
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,569
I think it's their doing

151
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,059
after they knew we've got the clip.

152
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,779
So, they tried to destroy us first.

153
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,169
What should we do?

154
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,839
Mom already exposed them with all the evidence,

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,149
but still, we can't accuse them of anything?

156
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,480
The only way to handle this is

157
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,640
to let the person involved in this confess it.

158
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,240
Are you talking about Dad?

159
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,849
Do you think he'll agree to do it?

160
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,040
He doesn't pay attention to us at all.

161
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,416
(Unexpected past stories of Venus's son and daughter)

162
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:31,541
(Her son got exposed for killing someone.)

163
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,049
(while her daughter was revealed to once have an abortion.)

164
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:36,256
(Their unacceptable behaviors are being widely questioned by society.)

165
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,609
(Jate: I think Wat is also running away from them.)

166
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,990
(Nus, don't go anywhere alone now. It's dangerous.)

167
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,470
It's me.

168
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,180
What else do you want from us?

169
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,469
You got me almost no place to be.

170
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,069
Now, you're asking as if you're a victim?

171
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,600
Huh?

172
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,580
We're both victims.

173
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,329
But I have a solution for you.

174
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,549
And this will be my last time offering you a deal.

175
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,279
In the press conference,

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,719
if you want to reveal anything or expose any truth, just go ahead.

177
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,219
But you must change the topic.

178
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,859
Change the topic?

179
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,439
Yes.

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,829
You must say that

181
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,389
the evidence you've got is not valid.

182
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,079
Tell them it's a bit of a misunderstanding.

183
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,079
Say that you want to withdraw from your candidacy.

184
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,859
Wait until everyone no longer pays attention to this,

185
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,310
and you can change to side with Thachai as his assistant.

186
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,859
He told you to say this to me?

187
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,800
Or is it your own idea?

188
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,219
I came up with

189
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,779
what sounds possible

190
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,130
to make everyone safe.

191
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,569
If you really want to save your kids, '

192
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,570
this is the only solution.

193
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,560
You probably lose face a bit,

194
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,390
but everyone will be safe.

195
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Think it over.

196
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,310
Do you really want to trade it all for that?

197
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,679
Honey.

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,219
One broom and black plastic bags, please.

199
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,569
Do teens these days know how to do chores?

200
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,139
Well, I sweep the floor for my mom's shop.

201
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,790
Are you the son of Mai and Petch?

202
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,110
Well, yes.

203
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,709
Petch, your son is here.

204
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,519
So he can pay the amount you owe me for the drinks.

205
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,959
Hey, it's been so long.

206
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,459
You look so damn handsome in that outfit.

207
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,810
You have a lot of money, right?

208
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,349
Your friend is a millionaire's son, right?

209
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,699
Treat me to some liquors today, okay?

210
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,829
You'd better get their daughter pregnant again

211
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,379
so they will take care of our whole family,

212
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,709
and we'll get to live comfortable lives forever.

213
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,229
Dad, stop looking down on me like this already.

214
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,609
It sounds like our family is so crappy.

215
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,989
It actually is.

216
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,399
Is anyone in our family good?

217
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,350
Your sister?

218
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:34,720
Your mom?

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Mom.

220
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,330
Why did you do this?

221
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,039
He's too worthless for you.

222
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,879
I don't want to live alone.

223
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,959
I don't want anyone to insult me that

224
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,170
I'm a widow because my husband left me.

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,299
Why would you care about those insults?

226
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,069
You just wanted to beat those gossip words so much

227
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,070
that you agreed to trade your happiness for it?

228
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,609
How could you call this winning?

229
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,269
Why are you talking too much?

230
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,369
Pay for the drinks for me now.

231
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,929
No, I won't.

232
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,109
I'll take Mom home.

233
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,020
Go ahead.

234
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:11,839
Your mom will come back to me anyway.

235
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,859
Impossible.

236
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,279
I won't allow her to.

237
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,309
By the way,

238
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,249
I haven't forgotten what you cursed me.

239
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,639
I repeat it every day.

240
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,760
I'll never be like you, Dad.

241
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,600
I won't hurt our family like you did.

242
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,829
Wait and see, Dad.

243
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,210
We'll become a happier family without you.

244
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,790
We'll be better.

245
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,010
Mom, come with me.

246
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,040
Just go.

247
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,039
(I've already arranged for Mink to see you two.)

248
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,260
(But she told me she wants to see Peem only.)

249
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,860
(Sure.)

250
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:56,309
(She'll get everything as wished.)

251
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,200
(Fine.)

252
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,779
(It's better if I go alone.)

253
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,620
(There are so many things I want to hear directly.)

254
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,600
(But from another person.)

255
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,630
There's only one thing I still can't get over.

256
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,270
What clip is exactly in that file?

257
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,579
Why do you want to know?

258
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,259
So that I would know at least

259
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,339
whether my time and feelings wasted

260
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,340
were worth anything at all.

261
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,310
You don't have anything else to lose, do you?

262
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,219
I'm scared.

263
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,170
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,090
I'm scared.

265
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,920
I knew it.

266
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:33,279
You really abused her.

267
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,649
Because you are like this,

268
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,939
she could deceive all of you.

269
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,939
Do you want to see it from another angle?

270
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,690
Let's watch the file she asked you to risk

271
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,210
your life to get from this house.

272
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,350
Huh?

273
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,389
You asked for money every day.

274
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,689
You don't even work.

275
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,739
Have you ever done any chores?

276
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,939
Do it yourself.

277
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,509
It's not my duty.

278
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,270
What?!

279
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,669
You're going out, right?

280
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,580
What's your problem?

281
00:16:58,581 --> 00:16:59,829
This.

282
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,420
Here.

283
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,960
Where are you going?!

284
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,150
This.

285
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,920
Ouch!

286
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,410
Don't hurt me.

287
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,750
Please, don't.

288
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,520
Please.

289
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,470
I'm begging me.

290
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,289
Set me free.

291
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,199
Set me free, please.

292
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Karn, please.

293
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,659
That's how the game started.

294
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,339
She stole 3 million baht from me

295
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,090
and then deceived you guys

296
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,519
so she could have some witnesses

297
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,619
and someone to help her.

298
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,869
Why did you two do this?

299
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,629
It started because

300
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,819
he was hot-headed

301
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,819
and always forced me to become

302
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,029
whatever he wanted.

303
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,979
I had to quit my job to stay at home

304
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,719
and follow everything he ordered.

305
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,719
He scolded me harshly.

306
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,939
He didn't allow me to see my family.

307
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,379
I'll talk to my mom!

308
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,700
Why did you go this far making up this whole story?

309
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,099
It's because

310
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,139
being mentally hurt shows no wounds.

311
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,629
When I told others about it,

312
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,449
they said it was a couple's issue

313
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,450
and suggested we clear things up nicely.

314
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,739
In the end, these wounds could become my voice.

315
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,040
Even if they're wounds you made up?

316
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,369
Yeah.

317
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,649
I think it's already worth it

318
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,350
as he already gave in

319
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,059
and lost everything.

320
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,059
After a proper divorce,

321
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,559
I must get what I'm supposed to get.

322
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,489
Now, I can give her the money, house, and whatever

323
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,489
she wants.

324
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,699
I want to end this whole thing already.

325
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,879
You gave in because you knew

326
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
you also treated her badly, right?

327
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,929
From being in love so much that you two got married,

328
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,399
how could you two end up like this?

329
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,369
It all started from so much love,

330
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,689
which then gradually hurt us.

331
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,570
How's the story?

332
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:21,880
Who do you think is wrong?

333
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,339
I sympathize with you

334
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,029
for having to bear this toxic relationship.

335
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,790
What you have been through must hurt you really a lot.

336
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,969
But you had no right

337
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,539
to make up the story about violence

338
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
to get back at someone like this.

339
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,580
Feel sorry for those who are really hurt because of this.

340
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,749
We have tried hard to help you with this,

341
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,279
but you used us.

342
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,240
Isn't there any better way?

343
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,909
Which way?

344
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,480
Laws.

345
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,390
Laws?

346
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,829
Let's put it this way.

347
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,149
If you figure out a better way,

348
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,149
let me know then.

349
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,899
No matter how much you argued with your husband,

350
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,820
you had no right to use my friend and me.

351
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,969
Oh, one more thing.

352
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,860
Stop being a thief.

353
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,869
Let me warn you one thing then.

354
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,179
Don't sleep with someone you don't know again

355
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,359
because you can never know

356
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,300
what that one sex will bring you to meet in life

357
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,650
if you don't want to end up like me.

358
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,929
(Wang Chao: When can you come back here?)

359
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,399
(Mrs. Venus told me to wait until everything is handled.)

360
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,149
(Actually, it's good. If I go back to the temple, problems will follow.)

361
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,919
(I don't want to trouble the abbot.)

362
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,169
(Ma Han: The abbot asked me to give his regards to you.)

363
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,749
(I also miss everyone.)

364
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,429
(In just a few days from now, I'll get back to my normal life.)

365
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,779
(Wang Chao: Your stories will forever be on the internet.)

366
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,200
(Can your life really get back to normal?)

367
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,059
Hey, stop!

368
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,930
Max!

369
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,549
Help!

370
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,569
Asshole, you're such a hero, huh?

371
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,629
Are you alright?

372
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,650
Ouch!

373
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,290
Hey!

374
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,540
Help!

375
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,570
Help!

376
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,710
Help!

377
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,349
(Though he just defended himself, )

378
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,509
(he fought back even more violently.)

379
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,819
(So who's actually wrong here?)

380
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,010
Kul.

381
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,270
Why are you that shocked?

382
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,469
Nothing.

383
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,379
You haven't been to the university for several days already.

384
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,790
Will it be okay?

385
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,480
Professors have just changed the classes into full-time online learning.

386
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,279
I just walked upstairs.

387
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,469
I saw many plainclothes police walking around down there.

388
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,670
I wonder who in this building needs that much security.

389
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,119
Is Gut not home yet?

390
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,189
Yeah.

391
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,929
He's so late today.

392
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,010
He didn't answer my calls.

393
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,930
Are you hungry?

394
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,910
I'll cook something for you.

395
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,330
(Kul.)

396
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:43,329
(Help me, Kul.)

397
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,310
Are you okay, Gut?

398
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,489
Where are you?

399
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,869
(Your brother is with me.)

400
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,199
(Keep this in mind.)

401
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,869
(If the clip gets leaked, )

402
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,199
(your brother will be gone forever.)

403
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,680
(Keep this in mind.)

404
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,710
(Brave Power Party)

405
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,820
(Venus Pongsawarin)

406
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,509
Apart from the party's agenda to officially announce.

407
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,359
Ms.Venus as a new face candidate,

408
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,008
today, another important issue related

409
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,219
to Mr. Thachai's family is part of the press conference

410
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,180
(Venus exposed her ex-husband's corruption.)

411
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,379
after Ms.Venus has just revealed information about his businesses.

412
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,669
It's expected that the issue is related to the swimmer.

413
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,356
who has been on the news for injuring Mr. Thachai's son.

414
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,279
Hey, don't forget to bring that cheer sign.

415
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,029
How could I?

416
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,409
Today, we'll root for Max the best we can

417
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,410
so he can finally be free.

418
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,464
(Max is "innocent.")

419
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:49,979
I think that word looks weird.

420
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,039
It looks like Max is a virgin or something.

421
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,439
Come on.

422
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,839
You think too much.

423
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,559
I made it especially to cheer him on.

424
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,579
Let him get by.

425
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,019
Did you already tell the abbot

426
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,019
to watch the live streaming of the press conference?

427
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,359
Not yet.

428
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,359
I went to see him in the morning,

429
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,139
but he wasn't there.

430
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,549
I don't know where he's gone to.

431
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,009
Really?

432
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,329
You went to see him already, right?

433
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,570
I did, but he wasn't there.

434
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,959
("Everyone deserves to be seen.")

435
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,959
Are you sure you want to join?

436
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,739
You told me you didn't want to meet anyone in the gang.

437
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,219
I'll join.

438
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,779
I guess everyone will be here today,

439
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,989
so I could say goodbye at least.

440
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,689
Say goodbye?

441
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,690
Where are you going?

442
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,250
Kong.

443
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,710
Come.

444
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,450
I'll help.

445
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,060
Thanks for coming.

446
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,060
I can't miss it, of course.

447
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,430
It's such an important event.

448
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,330
I can go back to the temple in the evening.

449
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,840
It will work out.

450
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Let's go.

451
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,810
Max.

452
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,110
Are you alright?

453
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,990
I have nothing else to lose.

454
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,950
Thank you so much, Mom.

455
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,249
Every time I see how determined you are,

456
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,620
I don't want to give up either.

457
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,170
Mom, you always have us.

458
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,110
It's time, Ms. Venus.

459
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,660
(Because society needs "brave people")

460
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:59,539
(Venus Pongsawarin, the leader of Brave Power Party)

461
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,579
Get out!

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,720
Murderer!

463
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:08,223
(A young murderer)

464
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,419
(She killed her own baby.)

465
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:10,330
(Go to jail!)

466
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,858
(We demand justice.)

467
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:13,334
(Mother of Monsters)

468
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,998
(We demand justice.)

469
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:22,664
(A young murderer)

470
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,279
That's not true at all, Wat.

471
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,919
The only way our family can survive doesn't depend on me.

472
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,570
It solely depends on you.

473
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,190
I'll do my part the best I can.

474
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,930
Max.

475
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,660
Where is he?

476
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,250
It's almost his turn.

477
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,929
(Hey. I've changed my mind.)

478
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,379
(Don't show that clip, no matter what.)

479
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,450
(Or else more people will get in trouble.)

480
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,700
Mom.

481
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,409
They went that way, officer.

482
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,489
Max is chasing them.

483
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,999
Let's discharge for your safety.

484
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll have the police take care of it from here.

485
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,070
Max, don't leak the clip.

486
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,209
Kong!

487
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,030
What's going on?

488
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,890
I don't know either.

489
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,039
He ordered you to do this, right?

490
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,499
I don't know what else I can do.

491
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,799
Guys, I saw Kul taking Max outside.

492
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,570
What's going on here?

493
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,200
I don't know.

494
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:04,359
We should hurry and follow them.

495
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,149
Let's go.

496
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,039
If you leak the clip,

497
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
he'll definitely hurt my brother.

498
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,669
Kul.

499
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,669
Think carefully.

500
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,530
We can help each other solve this.

501
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,410
Calm down.

502
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,069
Anyway, thank you so much

503
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,290
for risking your life to get the clip.

504
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,989
I didn't know he did this much shit to you.

505
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,569
I was also forced.

506
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,519
I couldn't believe

507
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,219
it was all because of a few scratches I accidentally made on his watch.

508
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,589
It's just a watch,

509
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,390
and I made a few scratches.

510
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,089
But my life has been screwed up this much.

511
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,079
It's just a toy of the rich, you know.

512
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,780
A watch?

513
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,229
But my life is totally ruined.

514
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,230
I'm screwed.

515
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,980
At the party, right?

516
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,950
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,749
Max, you asshole!

518
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,000
You're the cause of every bad thing

519
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,069
that happened to my life, aren't you?!

520
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,159
It was your doing again, wasn't it?

521
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,379
If you hadn't been such an asshole to me

522
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,479
and hadn't looked down on me from the start,

523
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,310
I wouldn't have done it.

524
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,210
You jerk!

525
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,359
It's because of your nature!

526
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,589
How could you do this to me?!

527
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,300
Kul, stop.

528
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,110
You have looked down on me all this time.

529
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:47,409
Won't you blame yourself a bit?

530
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,860
Why mustn't I shoot you, huh?

531
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,589
It's so fun to see losers fight among themselves.

532
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,949
It's like watching desperate dogs fighting over food.

533
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,429
Why musn't I shoot you now?

534
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,549
Give me some reasons.

535
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,739
It's all because of your nature!

536
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,890
Max!

537
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,719
Mr. Top, do you want me to handle him now?

538
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,630
Not yet.

539
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:05,189
I want to have more fun.

540
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,789
Wait until all of his friends are here.

541
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,299
What do you want me to do then?

542
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,190
Calm down.

543
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,249
It's because of you yourself.

544
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,060
Hey, Kul!

545
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,800
Let go.

546
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,799
Tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.

547
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,620
Kul, don't.

548
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,909
Do you know what happened to my life after you did that?

549
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,389
Do you think I want to do this?

550
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,060
Do you think I want to shoot you?

551
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,429
I don't want to do any of these things.

552
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,009
He forced me, asshole!

553
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,830
Kul, what are you doing?

554
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,000
I won't let anyone ruin my life anymore.

555
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,859
Kul, though you shoot Max,

556
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,859
nothing will get better.

557
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,540
Only your life will be ruined.

558
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,349
All the faults will be on you alone.

559
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,350
But my brother won't die!

560
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,559
Relax, Kul.

561
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
We won't leak the clip.

562
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,539
You already did as promised.

563
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,800
Nobody will hurt your brother.

564
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,450
Kul, relax.

565
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,810
Don't do this.

566
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,909
(If the clip gets leaked, )

567
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,299
(your brother will be gone forever.)

568
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,470
(He will be gone forever.)

569
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,149
There's only me

570
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,550
who can tell you what or what not to do.

571
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,399
You got that, Kul?

572
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,069
You're such an asshole

573
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,989
and also bad-mouthing.

574
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,989
What kind of person were you born into?

575
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,379
Someone like you dares to insult me?

576
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,899
You survived just now

577
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,359
because you were lucky.

578
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,879
But from today,

579
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,250
my dad won't let you guys slide.

580
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,820
Kul, shoot Max now.

581
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,889
If he's not dead,

582
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,029
your brother will.

583
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,680
Got it?

584
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,039
Kul, don't.

585
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,180
Shoot him.

586
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,170
Shoot him.

587
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,170
Kul.

588
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,639
I see.

589
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,119
Your brother is not that important to you, is he?

590
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,569
How about your dad?

591
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,480
Your mom?

592
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:30,549
Or your older brother?

593
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,469
Kul.

594
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,639
Just one word from me,

595
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,049
and your whole family will disappear.

596
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,049
Think carefully.

597
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,960
Who actually ruined your life?

598
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,790
Kul, shoot.

599
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,569
Shoot now.

600
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,919
Kul!

601
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,039
Shoot.

602
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,059
Shoot now.

603
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,240
Kul.

604
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,490
Shoot.

605
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:56,559
Kul.

606
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,790
Shoot now.

607
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,740
My dad's gun.

608
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,950
Kong!

609
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Kong!

610
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,019
Any middle child here?

611
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,039
(When people come together, no matter the reason, )

612
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,619
Cheers to the opening of Wednesday Club.

613
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,030
(I think that turns them into acquaintances, )

614
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,350
(and a bond is then created.)

615
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,359
(What holds them together could be the word "friends")

616
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,940
(but that means they must have mutual acceptance.)

617
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,289
(But if they don't, )

618
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,589
Who do you like?

619
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,679
I asked who.

620
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,759
(they probably meet)

621
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,749
(only to make a turning point in life.)

622
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,680
Where did you get this from?

623
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,619
This gun is the evidence in my dad's case.

624
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,299
(It could be either a small change)

625
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,429
Max!

626
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,370
Kul!

627
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,809
I don't trust Max.

628
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,259
(or a significant one, including death.)

629
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,030
Hey.

630
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,030
Let go of Kul.

631
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,560
(It's fine if we don't think of each other as friends.)

632
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,169
Hey, stop!

633
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,800
Stop!

634
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:21,129
(But I never regret that at least we have met, )

635
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,540
(though we almost had no good story to remember.)

636
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,640
May!

637
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:40,670
May!

638
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,090
May!

639
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,529
I'm glad to have you in my life.

640
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,530
Same here.

641
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,469
Here you are.

642
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,470
Two eggs.

643
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,359
You know what?

644
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,159
This is the first day since my dad passed away

645
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,309
when I feel good to be alive,

646
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,310
seeing something like this.

647
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,869
You should say thank you to the person giving you the money.

648
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,009
Your friend, that is.

649
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,299
For me,

650
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,299
I'd call her a true friend.

651
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,659
Thank you so much

652
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,829
for everything.

653
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,679
For the things you told me and things you never told me.

654
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,430
Thank you so much, really.

655
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,589
Don't be so sentimental.

656
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,229
I don't like it.

657
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,219
At first, when I let you stay here,

658
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,569
I want to feel like

659
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,289
someone is still living here.

660
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,769
To hear some sounds.

661
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,789
But I'm just lying to myself that my dad's still here.

662
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:59,199
Dad!

663
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,759
I'll keep this gun,

664
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,449
It's too dangerous when it's with you.

665
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:02,940
May.

666
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,520
Kong.

667
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:06,039
It's my dad's gun, Kong.

668
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,249
You told me not to have the gun with me

669
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,389
because it's dangerous.

670
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,459
But after you took it,

671
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,459
you couldn't take care of it?

672
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,780
What if one day, it comes back and hurts one of us?

673
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,440
This whole thing started because of me,

674
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,230
so I'll be the one to end it.

675
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,440
May!

676
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,199
May, wake up!

677
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,830
May!

678
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,800
May, wake up and talk to me!

679
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,819
May, wake up!

680
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,889
(The world spins around for us to meet)

681
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,109
(But to what end?)

682
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,549
(To be together for a moment)

683
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,429
(Or to love forever 'til time's end)

684
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,220
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

685
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Get lost, all of you.

686
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,600
Asshole.

687
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:15,619
Don't stick your nose in.

688
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,789
May was hurt like this because of you.

689
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,249
Why are we blaming each other?

690
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,119
The target was you, wasn't it?

691
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,439
I'm blaming you two.

692
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,399
All of us must be responsible for this.

693
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,469
I gave in to you too much already!

694
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,210
Hey, please.

695
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,359
We're friends.

696
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,389
Peem!

697
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,350
What kind of friends?!

698
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:30,609
People who met by chance

699
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,989
and treated each other like shit aren't friends!

700
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,029
If everyone wants to find who caused this whole thing,

701
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,849
it was me who brought everyone together.

702
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,079
If you could choose,

703
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,290
would you let all these things happen?
