1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,360
I'm giving you three days.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,940
If you don't come up with money to repay me,

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,080
You're in trouble.

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,320
I've seen that you like to spend money without thinking.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,170
And I'm someone who can do anything for money.

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,170
If you're so hungry for my money,

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,180
I'll feed you until you throw up.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,470
Damn it.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,520
Why does it have so many scratches?

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,630
Just because I'm poor,

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,500
I seem to be a bad guy?

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,840
Don't let me find out who did this.

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,920
You're surely done for.

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,850
You already have a boyfriend, right?!

15
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,100
Fine. I'm not living here anymore!

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,510
just go!

17
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,980
Don't ever come back!

18
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,830
Do whatever it takes.

19
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,890
Make Tam and Pali get back together.

20
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,890
If you help me, I'll help you.

21
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,810
Talk it out with Tam at Kong's party,

22
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,670
so you wouldn't have to face her alone.

23
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,520
I want to start over with you, Pali.

24
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,760
Pali.

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
Kanya?

26
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,230
Why are you here?

27
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,230
I just want to tell you in person.

28
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,900
I'll get back together with Pali.

29
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,140
When will you stop behaving like shit?

30
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,710
I know this relationship won't last anyway.

31
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,510
Ending it now is better.

32
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,410
Where is Mink?

33
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,300
Her ex-husband is here. I saw him.

34
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,580
Damn it.

35
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,360
Max.

36
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,790
It's such an important match.

37
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,320
Don't your family care to come and cheer you up?

38
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,420
No.

39
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,640
They're driving my sister to her university down south.

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,950
That's probably more important.

41
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,270
No more warm-ups.

42
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,890
Get ready for the match.

43
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,100
Hey, Max.

44
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,050
Your family got into an accident.

45
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,110
The hospital called.

46
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,250
They said your family got into a car accident.

47
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,250
All of them are in bad shape.

48
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,880
Dad!

49
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
Hang in there, Dad!

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,750
Dad!

51
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,900
You can't enter.

52
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,960
What about Mom?

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,800
What about my siblings?

54
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,050
Dad!

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,050
Dad!

56
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,420
Mom.

57
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Eat some, Dad.

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,560
If your venerable have decided to give up the worldly life,

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,810
I shall rejoice with your venerable.

60
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,710
From now on,

61
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,900
I will live here

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,140
and spend the rest of my life serving you.

What does it have to do with you?

73
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,110
Let's go home.

74
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm not going.

75
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,640
I said, let's go home!

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,360
You want me to go home to a trash like you?

77
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,850
I'm the trash?

78
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,010
More like you are.

79
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,200
You're the trash.

80
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,590
Otherwise, I wouldn't have left.

81
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,430
You're the trash.

82
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,330
Let's go home.

83
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,220
Go home!

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,730
Mink!

85
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,850
Mink!

86
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,500
Karn!

87
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,110
Mink!

88
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,920
Karn.

89
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,470
What?

90
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,220
Why are you so late?

91
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,560
May.

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,790
Not now, okay?

93
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,790
Karn.

94
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,860
You said you're going to come see me.

95
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,620
Where are you going?

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,350
I miss you.

97
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,350
Mmm...

98
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm a little tipsy today.

99
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,780
It's going to be fun.

100
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,580
What about in your car?

101
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,880
Is that what you want?

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,160
If you want something exciting,

103
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,870
I'll give it to you.

104
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,780
Mink.

105
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
It's alright now.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
You're safe now.

107
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,050
I don't get it.

108
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,670
Why do I have to go through something like this?

109
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,550
I should've died the way he wanted.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,710
Don't ever say that again.

111
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,220
You know what?

112
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,220
You're so precious.

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,870
To whom?

114
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,680
Not to my family.

115
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,370
You're precious to me, at least.

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
I care about you.

117
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,670
Why is it?

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,490
Why can't the person I love be you?

119
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,210
Look.

120
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,230
Even when I set up an event

121
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,230
for everyone to escape the real world and enjoy,

122
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,230
they still managed to ruin it.

123
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,670
Stop cleaning up, Max.

124
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,800
Don't you have practice tomorrow morning?

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,960
I still want you to win.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,940
Despite all the crappy things you went through.

127
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,680
For someone like me who has nothing,

129
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
today is the first day

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,000
that I'm glad I have someone like you as a friend.

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Get some rest.

132
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,210
You got this, Kong?

133
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,210
I got this. No big deal.

134
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
See you.

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,440
(Venus: Is there anyone else you sent over apart from me, Mrs. Venus?)

136
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,560
(No, I only trust you.)

137
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,340
There's no need to drive this fast, is there?

138
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,750
Don't you enjoy the thrill?

139
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,840
You know where Mink is, don't you?

140
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,950
Mink who?

141
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,910
Pali's sister.

142
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,700
How can you not know her?

143
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,070
She was at today's event too.

144
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,850
I've never seen her.

145
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,320
There are so many people at the event today.

146
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,670
I didn't pay attention to anyone specifically.

147
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,640
Are you sure?

148
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,180
Yeah.

149
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,310
What the hell are you doing?

150
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,910
I'll give you another chance.

151
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,360
Where is Mink?

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,800
Who is she with?

153
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,700
How the hell would I know?

154
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,830
Hey! That's the red light.

155
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,180
I'm asking you one more time.

156
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,140
Where is Mink?

157
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Who is she with right now?

158
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,320
Stop asking me something I don't know.

159
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,710
What the hell are you doing?

160
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,570
Stop being so foolish.

161
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,570
Don't make me pay for something I didn't do.

162
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,780
If you're still going to keep saying you don't know,

163
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,350
I will not call you May anymore.

164
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,350
I'll call you a liar.

165
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,720
I'm still that liar who can crash your damn car.

166
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,350
Let go!

167
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,470
What's going on?

168
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,090
Get off.

169
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,530
I said get off.

170
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,750
Get off!

171
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,780
Find your way home.

172
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,340
Count this as a blessing for your chance.

173
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,180
If you realize you have something to tell me,

174
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,070
then call me.

175
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,140
Or you'll get to face some excitement like this a little more often.

176
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
Damn it.

177
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,730
Dad.

178
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,180
Save me.

179
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,750
May.

180
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,030
What's wrong?

181
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,250
Where have you been?

182
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,040
Why are you in such bad shape?

183
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,780
Or perhaps...

184
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,610
Did someone hurt you?

185
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,610
You can tell me about it.

186
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,580
Will you help me, Tam?

187
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,350
Of course.

188
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,350
We're friends.

189
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,540
Why wouldn't I help you?

190
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,550
Tam.

191
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,530
I'm sorry for being selfish.

193
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,230
I'm sorry that I'm like this.

194
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,970
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,500
It's okay.

196
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Don't cry anymore.

197
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,900
Enough.

198
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,620
Don't cry anymore.

199
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,790
Shift it a little to the right.

200
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,890
Then arrange them neatly.

201
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,430
That's right.

202
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,870
Hello.

203
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,490
I didn't know you fancy sports.

204
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,490
I'm just here to watch Max practice.

205
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,760
Which ones are you down for?

206
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
For the 100 meters, sir.

207
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,020
Do we need new decorations just for an internal competition?

208
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,940
Our university has been receiving funding support for this pool for four years.

209
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,350
But we're not sure

210
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,980
whether we'd still get this money after Mr. Thachai's son graduated.

211
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,420
Who's that?

212
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,690
Top from the fourth year.

213
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,450
He's the gold medalist for all the races.

214
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,720
Really?

215
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,250
Do you know Mr. Thachai?

216
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,250
He's a politician.

217
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,870
But I didn't care.

218
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,870
His reputation doesn't seem to be very pleasant.

219
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,300
You might want to start caring now.

220
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,260
Your mom is becoming his competitor.

221
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,280
From now on,

222
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,480
you might be hearing his name more often.

223
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,650
Competitor?

224
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,980
Kong.

225
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,490
Yeah?

226
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,160
I'll go practice now.

227
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
Keep it up.

228
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,550
That swimsuit Max is wearing,

229
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,190
would it make him swim faster?

230
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,540
I don't think so, Professor.

231
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,320
It would only make it slower because the suit is heavy.

232
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
People who wear something like this

233
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,280
are usually hiding something.

234
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,650
Do you know why?

235
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,600
Thank you so much for giving me a ride.

236
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,770
It's alright.

237
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,770
I want to get to know you better.

238
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,850
By the way, I want to say hello to your father.

239
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,850
Does he work here?

240
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,210
Let's go.

241
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,550
Luang Por.

242
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,550
This is my friend, Kong.

243
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,910
This is Luang Por Chai.

244
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,440
He's my dad.

245
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,210
And that's my mom.

246
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,100
My older sister.

247
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,930
And my younger sibling.

248
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
You get to meet them all.

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,120
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,260
I've never asked how you're doing.

251
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,420
And I've never known

252
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,730
that you're living with your dad who's an abbot.

253
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,260
Also, about your mom.

254
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,600
It's fine.

255
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,720
It's something of the long gone past.

256
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,890
I'm over it.

257
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,480
And I do hope

258
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,840
that Luang Por will get over it too.

259
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,910
He was ordained because he felt guilty

260
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,530
for not being able to save the family.

261
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,180
Then, is there anything I can help?

262
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,940
For me,

263
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,770
us being friends is already something beyond my imagination.

264
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,290
I want to pay respect to the Buddha.

265
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,290
Can you take me to the main hall?

266
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,350
A drunk-and-drive offender is doing his volunteer here today.

267
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,630
I'm the one who recommended this temple to him.

268
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,320
That's nice.

269
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,430
Have you talked to Pali?

270
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,920
Not yet.

271
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,200
Why?

272
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,190
I think the two of you

273
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,660
should straighten it out already.

274
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,140
The main Buddha here is very sacred.

275
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,710
If you give your word,

276
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,950
you should do exactly as promised.

277
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,220
Then the odds will be in your favor.

278
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,740
I know you wouldn't trust my words anymore.

279
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
I have no hard feelings for you on that.

280
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,940
You have all the right to feel that way.

281
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,110
That's right.

282
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,070
Who would be able to believe the words of someone who lies repeatedly?

283
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,290
I won't ask you to forgive me this time.

284
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,770
I won't ask for your blessings.

285
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,830
At least if I don't have your blessings,

286
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,920
I hope you're rooting for me.

287
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Why would I be rooting for you?

288
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,310
If you don't want to root for me,

289
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,730
then root for Kanya.

290
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,350
I'm not the only one who got hurt in this story.

291
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,350
Your sister did too.

292
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
What are you going to do?

293
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
I will talk to your mom.

294
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
I will show her

295
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,690
that I'm no longer who I used to be.

296
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,690
Where have you been?

297
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,060
I was worried.

298
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,880
If you were worried,

299
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,180
why didn't you answer my calls in the first place?

300
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,860
I know I'm the reason you don't want to come here.

301
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,860
But I sent Mink to live somewhere else.

302
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,490
Somewhere safe.

303
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,020
It's my fault

304
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,260
for caring for someone more than you.

305
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,670
I was with Tam.

306
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,870
Tam?

307
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,130
The first thing that you should know is

308
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,130
I don't hate Tam.

309
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,290
I even feel bad for putting her through all the bad things.

310
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,640
And you don't have to feel bad either.

311
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,070
Even if Mink is more important than me,

312
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,550
that's your business.

313
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,290
But I don't want anyone to go through miseries either.

314
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,290
Especially you.

315
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,090
Let me really ask you this, May.

316
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,510
What's going on?

317
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,870
Don't tell me

318
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,310
That you know Mink's husband.

319
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,580
Is that it?

320
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,070
How?

321
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,960
That kind of guy?

322
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,690
A dating app.

323
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,000
Damn it.

324
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,860
Than that...

325
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,020
Yeah!

326
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,530
The condom peel at the club,

327
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,300
I didn't clean it up properly.

328
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,170
What about you and Mink?

329
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,820
I don't have any feelings for that damn Karn guy.

330
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,440
He's even a jerk.

331
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,830
You know that

332
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,240
then why don't you back away from him?

333
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,640
Since last night,

334
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
I have decided that I'd help Mink.

335
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,790
So she would be free from that jerk.

336
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,790
And that's the reason why I'm keeping him around.

337
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,300
Wouldn't that be even more dangerous?

338
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,700
I have to be worried about you

339
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,570
and about Mink at the same time.

340
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,080
In my opinion,

341
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,650
if you treat this as a trade-off,

342
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,650
I think it's worth it.

343
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,970
But for you,

344
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,710
if you really have feelings for Mink,

345
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,710
I don't think it's going to be worth it.

346
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,880
Is this you?

347
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,990
My friend sent it to me.

348
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,320
How come you have all the expensive stuff?

349
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,750
Where did you get it?

350
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,690
No.

351
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,720
That's not,

352
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,040
that's not me.

353
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,190
What do you mean that's not you?

354
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,900
Look.

355
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,170
That's definitely you.

356
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,170
The thing is,those are not mine.

357
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,780
They're just lent to me.

358
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,840
That's a shame.

359
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,660
I thought you would land these types of jobs.

360
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,220
I thought we were becoming rich.

361
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,220
Why?

362
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,870
What would you do if we were rich?

363
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,030
I don't want anything.

364
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,260
I just

365
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,400
want some money to pay rent for a new house.

366
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,620
Have you seen the apartment our parents are renting?

367
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,870
It's very small

368
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,870
if we all were to live together.

369
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,370
What are you talking about, renting an apartment?

370
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,600
What about this house?

371
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,020
Haven't you talked to Mom recently?

372
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,650
This house's getting expropriated.

373
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,720
They're going to build a state's building.

374
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,790
The money we'll get is very little.

375
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,390
It probably won't get us a new house.

376
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,550
So Dad's thinking of renting an apartment

377
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,930
And then what?

378
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,860
Are we going to live poorly like before?

379
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,330
Yes, Miss Prang.

380
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,780
(Mr. Kul, when are you going to upload your car road trip video?)

381
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,120
The car?

382
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,360
It's almost up.

383
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,090
Just another couple of days.

384
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,810
Don't worry.

385
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,200
So you're back.

386
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Nowhere to go is it?

387
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,230
I thought you would have something up your sleeves.

388
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,230
You have nowhere to go in the end.

389
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,150
Dad.

390
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,970
I have something to talk to you about.

391
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,160
(I was about to call you.)

392
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,980
(I'm going to Bangkok on my birthday this year.)

393
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,510
(I'll stop by to see you and your Grandmother.)

394
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,780
Please come quickly.

395
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,440
After your birthday,

396
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,320
can I go home with you?

397
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,210
I really don't want to live here anymore.

398
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,120
35,000 Baht per for a day of rent?

399
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,140
Yes.

400
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,870
Class-one insurance included.

401
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,970
This rental price is cheap for this level of car.

402
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,990
Whether you're taking this to boast in front of someone

403
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,500
or for video shooting,

404
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,970
you're definitely getting more than you paid.

405
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,390
It's a total upgrade to your life.

406
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,570
I'll come back later.

407
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,860
Sure.

408
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,230
You've upgraded to renting luxury cars already?

409
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,120
It's good that you're getting the real one, not a fake one.

410
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,270
It's been so long.

411
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,750
I thought you were going to become my client.

412
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,830
Are you not going to rent?

413
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,090
You don't like it?

414
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,470
Or do you not have enough money?

415
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,470
Where would you get the car to flaunt on TikTok

416
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,270
for your clout, Mr. Rich Guy?

417
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,290
Hey.

418
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,290
Where are you going?

419
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,360
What I'm going to do is none of your business.

420
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,270
You know what?

421
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,680
I like you the most among our circle of friends.

422
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,750
Because you never change.

423
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,690
You're still fake as always.

424
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,690
Let's take a selfie for a keepsake.

425
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,890
I was going to give you a discount.

426
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,240
I should just charge you the normal price.

427
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,580
(Dream)

428
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,640
(Dream: What about my 100,000 Baht?)

429
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,890
(If you don't wire it by tomorrow,)

430
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,180
(you won't have a thing left in your life.)

431
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,510
Damn it!

432
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,180
What's up with you today?

433
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,640
Why are you so quiet?

434
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,550
Nothing.

435
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,230
If nothing then why do you seem so scared?

436
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,230
Have you got anything to tell me?

437
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,930
A little accident happened

438
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,280
to the watch you lent me.

439
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
There are scratches on it.

440
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,200
You call this 'a little accident'?

441
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,890
I told you how much this cost, haven't I?

442
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,750
Do you think you can repay for this?

443
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm so sorry. I really didn't mean to.

444
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,680
It was an accident.

445
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,400
If there is any way I can repay for it,

446
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,300
I'm in.

447
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,960
You're saying this as if you have any money.

448
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,380
Even if you sell your house,

449
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,070
you wouldn't even be able to pay for it.

450
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,230
- Top. - 	Is that right?

451
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,890
Top.

452
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,680
I'm really sorry.

453
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,770
It was an accident.

454
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,530
I didn't mean for it to happen.

455
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,530
And I'm having problems with money right now.

456
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,700
I don't know who to go to apart from you.

457
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,700
You're the only one who can help me.

458
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,630
There's actually a solution.

459
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,640
If you want my help,

460
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,860
then it's as I've always asked you.

461
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,180
This time, whether it's your house,

462
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,480
your car,

463
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,920
this watch,

464
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,770
monthly allowance,

465
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,110
or anything you want,

466
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,770
you'll get it all.

467
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,540
Is that enough?

468
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,410
I know.

469
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,080
Every beginning is tough.

470
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
I'll help make it easier.

471
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
If you say yes,

472
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,710
you'll be well off for the rest of your life.

473
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,210
And all the problems you're facing today

474
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,210
will become just a joke.

475
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,620
What will it be?

476
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,610
Will you pay for the damage

477
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,200
or agree to my offer?

478
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,680
Fine.

479
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,780
Good boy.

480
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,410
I accept your offer.

481
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,700
Max!

482
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,920
(Keep it up, Top!)

483
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,170
Coming up is the 100-meter male swim race.

484
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,690
The previous gold-medal record belongs to

485
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,690
Mr. Anankit Pisitvaja,

486
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,390
taking lane number 7.

487
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,480
Let's see if our champion, Top,

488
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,480
will be able to keep his position.

489
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,750
Let's get it, Max!

490
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,890
Ready.

491
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,890
Get set.

492
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Take your mark.

493
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,170
It's got started!

494
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,170
As expected,

495
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,820
our champion is still in the lead.

496
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
We're passing the first 30 meters.

497
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,770
Turning at the first 50 meters.

498
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,150
Faster!

499
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,300
Faster, Max!

500
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,420
He's still on the lead!

501
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,260
Oh!

502
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,390
Keep your eyes on lane 6.

503
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,880
Max is coming closely along.

504
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
The final 20 meters.

505
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
You got it!

506
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,310
Just a little more!

507
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,230
A little more!

508
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,070
Unbelievable!

509
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,940
Our Max on lane 6 is out running Top!

510
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,100
He got to the finish line!

511
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,130
Max!

512
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,170
You're the best!

513
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,990
Our champion, Top, is defeated by Max in lane 6.

514
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,860
You did it!

515
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,140
I'm not taking it.

516
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,300
This is going to be a big deal.

517
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,480
(Max from Youth Club, the gold medalist.)

518
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:57,170
After the official launch of the Youth Club,

519
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,900
we've got another successful stepping stone

520
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,190
from hearing the voices of the youth who joined the project.

521
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,110
(Max is the real deal. #TheArmoredShark)

522
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:02,830
(The fish got nothing on you.)

523
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,401
(You're too fast.)

524
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:04,073
(A thick suit with a big heart.)

525
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:04,710
(A little faster and you're a salmon.)

526
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,710
- Joining the program provides them with more opportunities.

527
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,530
I'm living at this temple

528
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,920
so that I can be with my family.

529
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,380
They've all passed away.

530
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,520
I'm only left with my sentimental anchor,

531
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,600
Luang Por.

532
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,650
I almost gave up,

533
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,280
had I not gotten the help.

534
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,546
(Venus Kongsawarin (Founder of Youth Club.)

535
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm glad to be part of the growth of today's youth.

536
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,850
I'll keep going.

537
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,073
(Youth Club, CSR for the community by Venus Kongsawarin.)

538
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,890
I want to show that for those who are unnoticed,

539
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,400
we'll find them

540
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,690
and will always help them out.

541
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,690
That's Mr. Thachai!

542
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,580
What are you doing at this temple today, Mr. Thachai?

543
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm here for a big merit-making event.

544
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
And also to wish for success in the upcoming election.

545
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,750
I heard

546
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,750
that this temple is very sacred.

547
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,120
I like that you're so enthusiastic.

548
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,760
But let me really ask you.

549
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,900
Are you that confident that you're going to defeat me?

550
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,750
I've been watching over this area for generations.

551
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,860
Anything is possible.

552
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,770
We can't stop the wind of change.

553
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,780
You see,

554
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,374
the boy from my foundation

555
00:35:56,399 --> 00:36:00,594
even defeated your son, the all-time champion.

556
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,390
Oh ho.

557
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,830
The cake looks so nice.

558
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,230
Well, you haven't seen your dad in a while.

559
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,680
It's his birthday too.

560
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,900
Just go big.

561
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,700
I was planning to buy him a cake.

562
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
You shouldn't have burdened yourself.

563
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,250
I just want to help you with anything I can.

564
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,680
Shall we go?

565
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,100
Let's light the candles here, so he'd be surprised.

566
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,460
Your dad's here, right?

567
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,620
Yeah. Thank you.

568
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,940
I'll light them up.

569
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,780
Let's go.

570
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,410
Why don't you just tell her

571
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,080
that you're not going to take her with you?

572
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,530
What are you holding your tongue for?

573
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,270
Then you have to allow me to speak the truth.

574
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,020
Find some other ways.

575
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,220
Why would you say it?

576
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,680
Isn't it time to say it, Mom?

577
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,460
Tam is old enough to accept the truth.

578
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,450
She should be thankful that we took her in and raised her.

579
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,450
It's way better than being a homeless kid

580
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,620
born from a wretched mom like that.

581
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,820
Tam.

582
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,240
So it's probably just me

583
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
who loves Dad and Grandma.

584
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,150
If you think I'm the unwanted one,

585
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,240
why did you take me in?

586
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,350
Why didn't you let me die with that wretched mom

587
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,350
that Grandma always curses at?

588
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,610
No wonder.

589
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,660
That's why you hated me so much, Grandma.

590
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,340
If I were to choose,

591
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,110
I don't even want to live in this house.

592
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,830
I didn't even want to be born.

593
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,280
Tam!

594
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,340
Tam!

595
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,810
Mom!

596
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,990
Mom!

597
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,550
Grandma!

598
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:05,790
Mom!

599
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,320
Grandma!

600
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,060
Dad!

601
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,800
Grandma!

602
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,070
Mom!

603
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,160
Hang in there!

604
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,180
Grandma!

605
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,850
Where's Kanya?

606
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,270
She has some business.

607
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,780
But I have an appointment with her.

608
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,750
It's important.

609
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,060
It's urgent.

610
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,230
Is there anything?

611
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,520
Hello.

612
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,870
It's been a while.

613
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,400
Kanya's not here.

614
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,070
(Max)

615
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,350
You really didn't get

616
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,010
why I had you and Kanya separated back then, did you?

617
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,200
Kanya.

618
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,790
What's wrong?

619
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,000
What do we do, Pali?

620
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,580
Don't worry.

621
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,390
Kanya.

622
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,560
Go get changed.

623
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,950
You're going to the hospital with me.

624
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,310
I've booked an appointment with the doctor.

625
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,670
Are we really going to go ahead with that?

626
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,860
Then what do you think?

627
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,610
There's no such thing as teen parenting.

628
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,220
You're both just going to drag each other to ruins.

629
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,720
You got that?

630
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,540
But I would do anything.

631
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,090
Or just anything I can do, I'd do my best.

632
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,960
Just anything.

633
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
What to do?

634
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,600
I have two solutions for you.

635
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
One is getting the underage sexual offense charge.

636
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,560
Two is to never meet Kanya again.

637
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,950
I hope you're not going to make the wrong choices again.

638
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,560
Mom.

639
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,390
Get up!

640
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,340
Mom.

641
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,090
Let's go, now!

642
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,450
Pali.

643
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,860
I've apologized hundreds of times.

644
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,520
But I'd keep doing it.

645
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,180
I won't ask for you to forgive me.

646
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,390
But I won't repeat the same mistakes.

647
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,640
Not repeating the same mistakes for the rest of your life?

648
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,430
No one can do that, Pali.

649
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,090
I'll redeem myself, little by little.

650
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,250
I'll prove to you that I'm not the one I used to be.

651
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,350
It might take a year,

652
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,770
two years, or three years.

653
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,600
But I'm willing to accept it.

654
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,350
Then five years it is.

655
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,570
Wait until Kanya gets back from the States.

656
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,990
She's getting her visa now.

657
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,010
She's flying out tomorrow.

658
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,640
Mom.

659
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,990
Why are you doing this?

660
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,810
Why don't you let her choose?

661
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,000
I let her choose once.

662
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,960
But this time,

663
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
let me be the one to make the call, Kong.

664
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,190
Not only about this

665
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,130
but also that old house of mine that you used for throwing the party.

666
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,320
I want it back.

667
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,370
I don't want you to do something like that ever again.

668
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,000
It would only bring trouble.

669
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,080
Have you ever asked her whether she wants to go?

670
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,820
Have you ever asked me

671
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,040
about what I want to do?

672
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,640
Why does everyone's life have to revolve around you?

673
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,240
Someone like this

674
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,910
is going to be the leader of others?

675
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,260
You can't even understand your children.

676
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,370
How can you take care of others?

677
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,340
What kind of mother do you think I am, Jate?

678
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,110
To make my own child feel that way?

679
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,060
I know that everything you do is out of good intentions.

680
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,500
But you're not saying I did the right thing, are you?

681
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,760
Being a parent is so hard.

682
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,600
Wanting the best for them is just not enough.

683
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,180
Why are you in such a hurry to send Kanya away?

684
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,470
(Is there anyone else you sent over apart from me, Mrs. Venus?)

685
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,090
I knew from the start

686
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,560
when Kong told me someone had broken into his party.

687
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
He thought it was me.

688
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,940
I did some digging.

689
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,760
Then the other day

690
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,910
I saw a familiar face popping about at the event again.

691
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,290
And that's not all to it.

692
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,200
(Wirot: Someone's stalking Miss Kanya.)

693
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,670
I think what I'm doing is putting everyone in trouble.

694
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:41,520
I can handle Kong.

695
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,970
But I'm worried about Kanya.

696
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,320
I want her to be somewhere safe

697
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,810
before anything worse happens.

698
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,090
I will have to let my children hate me for a while.

699
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,530
It's getting started, right?

700
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,010
It has started for a while.

701
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,010
Even before we know it.

702
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,040
Nus, someone is trailing us.

703
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,420
Back off from this.

704
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,110
Otherwise, there's no guarantee what will happen.

705
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:50,010
DIRECTED BY CHAINARONG TAMPONG

706
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,300
If you don't take risks, this would never end.

707
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,090
If we're afraid, 	he would think he has the upper hand.

708
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,950
Then there must be some evidence left at home.

709
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,180
I'll go get it.

710
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,860
Please really help me.

711
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,440
I got this.

712
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,760
Why did you do it without talking to me?

713
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,150
If you were in your best condition,

714
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,450
I might not have won.

715
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,500
I'll treat you as another one of my fans.

716
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,230
I'll give you a great service.

717
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,150
You'll get to be more intimate with me than anyone else.

718
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,920
You jerk!

719
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,360
What rights have you to hurt other people?

720
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,010
Hey.

721
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,050
Shut up.

722
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,340
Can't you see how he hurt Top?

723
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:19,960
But now,

724
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,500
all of you, get out.

725
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,510
Get out!

726
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,470
I want to be alone.

727
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,290
Get out!

728
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,870
This will be the last time

729
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,800
that I can extend my care to you.

730
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,900
I'm not afraid.

731
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,460
Kong.

732
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,310
I think you should stop.

733
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,770
This isn't helping.

734
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,850
This isn't who you are.

735
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,170
Do you think all the girls can only like you?

736
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,080
Who do you like?
