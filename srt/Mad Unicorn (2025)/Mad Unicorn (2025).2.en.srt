00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:13,500
WAWEE, CHIANG RAI, 2014

2
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,041
There!

3
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,291
- Come here, fucker!
- Hey!

4
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,500
Motherfucker!

5
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,125
Hey!

6
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,583
Thong!

7
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,166
Thong, stop.

8
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,375
I heard that some people fought
at Bangdai Crossroads last night.

9
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,541
Broken glass bottles and blood
were all over the ground.

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,583
Have you heard about it?

11
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,416
Thong! We're late.

12
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,458
We have to go, Mom.

13
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,250
Son, I'm worried about you.

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,875
Bro!

15
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,916
Hey, stop!

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,333
- Stop!
- Bro!

17
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,791
No! Bro!

18
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,958
- Stop!
- Hey!

19
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,041
Hey!

20
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
- Bro!
- Don't move!

21
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,375
- Bro!
- Thong!

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,333
Damn.

23
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,458
Don't move!

24
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,708
The son of Mr. Kai,
the subdistrict head,

25
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,041
came close to losing his arm
and bled a lot.

26
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,916
I asked which one of you scums did it?

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,708
You love each other so much, don't you?

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,625
I gave you guys a chance.

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,791
I'll just beat you up one by one then.

30
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,375
It's me!

31
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,375
I did it.

32
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:13,750
You?

33
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,541
That's all I need.

34
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,791
Bastard. You got me in trouble.

35
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,375
Santi, get up.
Someone's bailing you out.

36
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,750
Wait here.

37
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:42,833
You little punk.

38
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,125
What are you doing here, Pa?

39
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,375
What a fucking disappointment.

40
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,416
This way.

41
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,416
NORTH WAWEE POLICE STATION

42
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,083
Why the fuck are you crying?

43
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,708
He's still alive.

44
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,416
Get in the car.

45
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,916
Where are we going?

46
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,416
I said get in.
What's your fucking problem?!

47
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Pa, stop.

48
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,791
Fuck off!

49
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,666
Your mom asked me to help you.

50
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,666
Consider this a blessing.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,916
But don't ever think
I'm helping you for free.

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,708
From now on, you'll be working
in a mine to repay me.

53
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:47,416
Didn't you tell me you were going
to look after your mom and brother?

54
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,250
Look at you…

55
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
…a goddamn scum.

56
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,583
You're just a piece of trash.

57
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,416
<i>"A piece of trash."</i>

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,083
<i>Those were the words that stuck with me.</i>

59
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,916
<i>They pushed me to try</i>
<i>to accomplish everything on my own.</i>

60
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,125
BANGKOK, 2017

61
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,333
And how's your father now?

62
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,291
I don't know.

63
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,875
He must be working
as a contractor somewhere.

64
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
He's good at surviving. You know.

65
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,791
With zero experience,

66
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,166
he watched the workers mix cement
for a day and became so skilled at it.

67
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,125
So, you're just like your father.

68
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,041
How? We are nothing alike.

69
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:57,333
Seriously, it'd be nice if he sees me now.

70
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,166
He'll be fricking speechless.

71
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:05,291
I’d be thrilled if my son surpassed me.

72
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,916
Come here.

73
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,708
Wear it.

74
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,500
No way, sir. It's too fancy for me.

75
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,291
There's no "too fancy".

76
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,375
Make yourself worth the watch.

77
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,958
Put it on.

78
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,291
Alright.

79
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,083
But I must close this deal first.

80
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,541
If I can get the EASY team
to sign a contract with us,

81
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,791
then I’ll be worth it.

82
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,833
Good. Very good.

83
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,500
You see that?

84
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm seeing…

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,375
traffic jams, skyscrapers,
people waiting for the bus.

86
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,833
Why? What do you see?

87
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,416
Our empire.

88
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,875
Hello.

89
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,083
Hello.

90
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,166
Mr. Santi, let me introduce my team.

91
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,083
This is Xiaoyu, assistant
to the CFO of EASY Express China.

92
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,583
She is in charge of the research
for the entire team.

93
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you for your hospitality.

94
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,916
Do you know each other?

95
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,750
No.

96
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,125
Nice to meet you.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,708
Let's go.

98
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,083
- This way, please.
- Okay.

99
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,500
SIAM POSTAL SERVICE

100
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,458
This way, please.

101
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,916
Siam Express is a state-owned enterprise.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,291
Although it is not our direct competitor,

103
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,458
it has the largest market share
in the country.

104
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
I would like to show you around

105
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,875
so that you can have
an idea of the entire market.

106
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,125
SIAM POSTAL, SERVICE WITH HEART

107
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,500
The customer flow is about the same
as the branch on Nanjing Road.

108
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,250
Yes,

109
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,416
Siam Express is one
of the earliest companies

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,166
and is the preferred choice for Thais

111
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,875
because it is the cheapest
and most common,

112
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,708
and everyone is familiar with it.

113
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,625
Excuse me. What are you selling?
Looks like it sells well.

114
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,583
Gift shop items.

115
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,458
Are there a lot of orders?
How many packages a day?

116
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,958
Usually 50, but it can be
up to a hundred. It depends.

117
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,666
Whoa.

118
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,708
She said she could deliver
hundreds of pieces a day.

119
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,250
- So much?
- Yes.

120
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,875
She said normally, it’s 50 a day
and sometimes only 100, right?

121
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,250
Hey, isn't that a Thai herbal inhaler?

122
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,333
You must have been living here
for so long.

123
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,208
Please convey the original meaning.

124
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,208
This is FINIX.

125
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,291
It has the largest market share
among private companies,

126
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,208
with an annual turnover of eight billion.

127
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,416
It is the competitor
that we should surpass.

128
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,666
Their minimum shipping fee is 50 baht.

129
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,250
If EASY Express comes to Thailand
and sets the price at 25 baht minimum,

130
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,916
our positioning
will be cheaper and better than it.

131
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,000
Feel free to ask me anything.
Don't be shy.

132
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,375
Can you show us
the other branches as well?

133
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,083
No?

134
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,750
Of course.

135
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,625
But I think we should visit Kanin Group's
warehouse before school lets out.

136
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,750
I'm just worried about the traffic.
I’m sure you know how it is here.

137
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,333
Everyone, we should go.
We are running out of time.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
<i>Bangkok Daily</i>, owned by Kanin Group,
has completed digital transformation

139
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,041
and will serve as our infrastructure
in the field of express delivery.

140
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,916
We have warehouses
and newspaper delivery vehicles

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
that can be converted
into delivery vehicles at any time,

142
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,291
as well as professional drivers who are
familiar with roads across the country,

143
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:26,791
so there is no need
to worry about delivery.

144
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,250
We are ready to fight.

145
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,166
Once we join forces,
we will wake up quickly.

146
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,541
That is if we join forces.

147
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,625
This data fully illustrates the growth
trend of delivery in this market.

148
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,750
However, Kanin has no experience
in express delivery.

149
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,625
We are afraid
that the company's growth rate

150
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,958
will not keep up with the requirements.

151
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,208
In this fast-growing market environment,

152
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,916
there is no time for trial and error.

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,291
At least we should find
a more experienced leader.

154
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,750
That's all, Mr. Peter.

155
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,250
I agree with Miss Xiaoyu, Mr. Peter.

156
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,416
I agree with Miss Xiaoyu.

157
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,041
But before we continue,

158
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,166
may I have a moment for Mr. Santi,

159
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,500
our soon-to-be CEO,
to share something with you all?

160
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,916
But before we go on,

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,541
please allow us
to let the person in charge…

162
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,875
Tell them about Mama instant noodles.

163
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,541
The one you had told me before.

164
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,750
Right now, seriously?

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
PETER

166
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
Please allow me

167
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:02,375
to tell you my original intention
of doing this.

168
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,916
I grew up in the mountains.

169
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,958
We were very poor.

170
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,208
Do you know what the most expensive thing
I could eat in a month was?

171
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,250
It was instant noodles.

172
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
<i>I liked it very much.</i>

173
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,250
<i>I needed to save up 7 baht to buy a pack</i>
<i>and eat it with rice to feel full.</i>

174
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>When I was a kid, it took me half a day</i>

175
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,083
<i>to get down the mountain to the city</i>
<i>because it was so far away.</i>

176
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,208
<i>Then I found out that in the city,</i>

177
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,041
<i>a pack of instant noodles</i>

178
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,833
<i>cost only five baht.</i>

179
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,166
<i>Other things are also cheaper</i>
<i>than in the mountains.</i>

180
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,666
<i>This shocked me.</i>

181
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,041
This is very strange.

182
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,541
Why is everything more expensive
in the countryside than in the city?

183
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,791
We are obviously poorer.

184
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,291
The reason is logistics,

185
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,958
that is, shipping costs.

186
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,708
My dream

187
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,833
is that rural people can enjoy
the same cost as urban people.

188
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,083
There are many times
more poor people than rich people.

189
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,208
Our logistics will give people
opportunities to be more equal.

190
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,375
I'm grateful for the story
of Santi's rough childhood.

191
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,666
It means a lot to us.

192
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,875
I agree that experience is vital.

193
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,875
But I also believe that vision
and determination

194
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,583
will take us further
than we ever thought, Mr. Peter.

195
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,166
<i>Boy, remember my words.</i>

196
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,208
<i>If you serve society,</i>

197
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,166
<i>society will give back to you.</i>

198
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,333
<i>I think your company's proposal is good,</i>

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,458
<i>very complete and very thoughtful.</i>

200
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,625
<i>I agree.</i>

201
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,916
<i>We can start the legal process right now.</i>

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,416
Excuse me, Mr. Peter.

203
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,458
Before we proceed,
can we hold off on making a decision?

204
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you have any questions?

205
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,041
Our team is happy to answer.

206
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,333
Nothing,

207
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,625
just some market issues here
need to be confirmed.

208
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,333
<i>Okay. Hurry up.</i>

209
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,458
What do you want to say?

210
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,791
Do you want to go check out the market
or stores again?

211
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,541
- I'll take you there.
- No need.

212
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,666
I can take you there.

213
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,250
No, it's break time now.

214
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,583
That's fine. I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

215
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,000
We go by ourselves.

216
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,791
Do you know that kind of place?

217
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,791
I know there is a place
that is very lively and open all night.

218
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,000
I have taken people there
when I was a tour guide. Let me…

219
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,166
Which road? We can take a taxi.

220
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,916
Xiaoyu, let the locals take us there.

221
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,375
Yes, you foreigners are like lambs
to be slaughtered.

222
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,125
Be careful or you will be slaughtered
by the driver before you even have fun.

223
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,458
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

224
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,541
Let's go.

225
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,750
This way. Don't be afraid.

226
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,083
We exchange chips there.

227
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,416
Who should I bet on?

228
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,916
Hi.

229
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,500
Why did you postpone the deal?

230
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,500
They say people
who stack their chips are playing scared.

231
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,125
You think it's true?

232
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,916
What's so funny?

233
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,416
Having someone like you
as CEO seems quite risky.

234
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,416
You have to take risks to win.

235
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,750
Playing it safe like that
won't bring in any profit.

236
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,500
I only bet on a winning hand.

237
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,750
You're very easy to read.

238
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,291
Seems like you can't hide anything.

239
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,750
I have nothing to hide.

240
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,250
Straight flush. Congratulations.

241
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,875
You're not that hard to read yourself.

242
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,541
You’re playing scared. Just admit it.

243
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,541
It's you who need to admit it.

244
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,791
I recorded this
when we visited FINIX's branch.

245
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,291
They were all holding identical boxes.

246
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,625
Did you pay them to be there?

247
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,083
Don't tell me you postponed
the deal because of this.

248
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,541
Hey,

249
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,416
cardboard boxes are monopolized
by just a few manufacturers here.

250
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,916
The ones they use are the cheapest,
that's why.

251
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,791
You're too biased against me.

252
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,916
Throwing a tantrum
makes it even more obvious.

253
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,666
What do I need to do
to make you happy? Name it.

254
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,750
I don’t mix personal feelings with work.

255
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,875
It's unprofessional.

256
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,083
THONGCHAI

257
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,541
I just wanted it to come out
as perfect as it can be.

258
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,166
I never expected her
to make such a big deal out of it.

259
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,791
It's not wrong to make it look good.

260
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,833
But you shouldn't have been caught.

261
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,833
Change Xiaoyu's mind.

262
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,833
I can do that. Leave it to me.

263
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,750
How much?

264
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,250
How much?

265
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,625
I think…

266
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,041
one million baht.

267
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,666
FIVE MILLION BAHT

268
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,291
You can't buy her for just a million baht.

269
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,958
Tell her that if the deal goes through,

270
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,041
she is invited to be our CFO.

271
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,458
Don’t let our empire fall
by your carelessness.

272
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,833
BOM

273
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,625
- What?
- <i>Hey, it's Bom.</i>

274
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,083
<i>Took you long enough to fucking pick up.</i>

275
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,208
Yeah, I'm busy. Anything urgent?

276
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,708
<i>Your brother got arrested.</i>
<i>Is that urgent enough, asshole?</i>

277
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,458
<i>Time to go home, man.</i>

278
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,958
Hey, bro.

279
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,125
Bro. How's Bangkok?

280
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,166
How many kilos of money have you made now?

281
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,500
Damn it.

282
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,458
You just had to study
and take care of Mom. Is that so hard?

283
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:53,208
I told you Maitree got shit on
by the southside first.

284
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,208
Give it to me.

285
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,375
You could just fucking ignore them.
Forget about them.

286
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,666
Think about Mom for once.

287
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,625
What's so funny?

288
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,208
What the hell are you laughing at?

289
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,041
Are you listening to me?

290
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm with her every day,
unlike someone who's never around.

291
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,333
You little shit. I just bailed you out
and this is how you fucking talk to me?

292
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,250
Thong.

293
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,583
Keep this.

294
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,625
And go back to school.
Can you do that for me?

295
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,750
Huh? Can you do this one thing for me?

296
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,625
Why?

297
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,791
You think just giving us money
will solve everything?

298
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,583
You're just like Pa.

299
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,250
<i>It’s for their education.</i>

300
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,416
Is that too much to ask!?

301
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,541
Well, I don't have it.
What more do you want?

302
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,833
Why the fuck do they have
to study so much? It's fucking useless.

303
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,541
That's because
you gave it all to that bitch!

304
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,708
- Stay out of my business!
- Why?!

305
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,833
It's my money! It's good enough
that I let you live here.

306
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:22,958
Huh?!

307
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,083
- I need that money!
- You bitch! Get away from me!

308
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,041
It's for our children!

309
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,958
So fucking annoying!

310
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,208
The hell are you doing at home every day?

311
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,833
Did you even think about making money?!

312
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:30,833
Asshole!

313
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:31,875
Let's go for a ride.

314
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:32,916
What about you?!

315
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
- Are you done being a shithead?!
- What?! It's my money!

316
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:40,041
Get a job if you want it so much!

317
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,208
When I'm rich,

318
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,458
I'll buy a big house
and take Mom away from here.

319
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,083
Take me with you too.

320
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,291
Yeah.

321
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,583
<i>Xiaoyu, I looked at the reports</i>

322
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,333
<i>from the Ministry of Commerce</i>
<i>and the Chamber of Commerce,</i>

323
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,000
<i>and the data is similar to that reported</i>
<i>by Kanin Group.</i>

324
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,416
<i>I also asked several stores in the market,</i>

325
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,458
<i>and they all said that online sales</i>
<i>are 3 to 4 times that of offline sales.</i>

326
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,375
<i>You suspected that Kanin Group</i>
<i>was falsifying data before,</i>

327
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,041
<i>but now it seems</i>
<i>that what they said was true.</i>

328
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,875
Okay, don't forget to copy Mr. Peter.

329
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:00,833
I'll follow up with him in the morning.

330
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,750
<i>Okay.</i>

331
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,666
Thank you.

332
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,125
This one is hydro cream.

333
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,250
I sell them in sets of four.

334
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,708
It sells really well,
especially among pregnant women.

335
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,041
I also have those inner thigh
whitening creams.

336
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,000
- Okay, I have to go now.
- Right.

337
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:36,166
You're still at it, aren't you?

338
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,791
I went to see you at the hotel
and you weren't there.

339
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,041
Ming said you're out
visiting the other branches.

340
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,166
I knew you would be here.

341
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,541
Hey, where are you going? Let's talk.

342
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,125
What do you want?

343
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,541
Well, do you see
that there are a lot of customers?

344
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,208
I do. And then what?

345
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:56,000
So, it's obvious that this market
is really growing.

346
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,583
Hey, you should be excited.
This is our golden opportunity.

347
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,333
Yes, the golden opportunity
for my company.

348
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:04,750
But if we're to be partners,
it takes more than that.

349
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,291
I have an offer.

350
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,458
This will make it easier
for you to decide.

351
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:18,916
What offer?

352
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,666
Say what you want to say.

353
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,375
Just say it.

354
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,750
I'm sorry!

355
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,083
I won't do something like that again.

356
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,125
I'm a dirty liar.

357
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,250
I… I did pay those people
to stand in line.

358
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,875
It was solely my idea,
and I take full responsibility for it.

359
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:26,291
I don't want everyone to lose this
opportunity because of my foolishness.

360
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,833
I've worked hard and waited for this day
for six months.

361
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,958
This market is really growing.
Please believe me.

362
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,875
I swear I'll never repeat this mistake.

363
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,291
Please give me one more chance.

364
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,791
Please.

365
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,291
You lied.

366
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,041
Even once, it's still a lie.

367
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:04,541
No matter how much you apologize,
it won't change the fact.

368
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,541
We're already celebrating?

369
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,666
Of course, sir. Today is a good day.

370
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,291
I picked the best ones I could find,

371
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,666
so they would be worthy of our success.

372
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,833
What happened?

373
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,583
I didn't use it.

374
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:29,000
If I've given her the check,
we can forget about the deal.

375
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,625
So, what did you do?

376
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:39,000
I just bowed my head and apologized.

377
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,000
But you don't need to worry.

378
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,541
Our deal is too great to pass on.

379
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,625
We'll celebrate tonight. I'm sure of it.

380
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:57,083
Are you asking me
to bet everything on your words?

381
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,833
I've bet my everything too.

382
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,375
Your everything and my everything

383
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:19,083
are not the same.

384
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,875
Hello. Have a seat, please.

385
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,458
Hello, everyone.

386
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:52,208
After last week's meeting,

387
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:56,291
EASY Express conducted further research
on the Thai market.

388
00:33:56,916 --> 00:34:00,875
Today we are honored

389
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,041
to discuss this together.

390
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:09,500
Our team has conducted on-site data
verification in various market departments

391
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:13,916
in the past week and provided all feedback
data to Mr. Peter and management.

392
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:15,875
The conclusion is as follows.

393
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
EASY is very much looking forward
to cooperating with Kanin Group.

394
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:36,291
We will go back immediately to speed up
the drafting of the contract

395
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,333
and hope that Kanin Group
can start preparing

396
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,541
to open 50 branches across the country.

397
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,833
Three, two, one.

398
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,458
I'll pour some for you.

399
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,041
- That's enough.
- Good stuff.

400
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,375
I'll pour some for you.

401
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,875
Wow.

402
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,041
Let's get drunk tonight. Have another.

403
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll get more.

404
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,625
Hi. Can I have a glass of beer?

405
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,333
This kid is a talented painter.

406
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,625
I saw his potential
since he was in elementary school.

407
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:07,583
He was a part of the art program,
and this is his college thesis.

408
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,250
I liked it, so I bought it from him.

409
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,166
Oh, Mr. Kanin. I’m a little curious.

410
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,875
If the Chinese hold a 51% share
and we only have 49%,

411
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,416
does that mean
they will have more control?

412
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,208
Technology is the key
to an express business.

413
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,208
We're using their tech and their brand,

414
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:32,708
so we should let them lead.

415
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,916
You put 30 million in this
and mine is 19 million.

416
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:46,375
If you haven’t bought all my condos,
I would never be able to invest this much.

417
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,833
I gave it my all, you know?

418
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,708
It'll be even bigger.

419
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,291
If it turns a hundred million
into tens of billion baht like you said,

420
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,958
I would have at least 1.9 billion baht.

421
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,833
It's not that easy.

422
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:12,791
You would get three billion,
just a little bit more than me.

423
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,625
We wouldn't be here today without you,

424
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,583
my boy.

425
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:24,833
Hold on, sir.

426
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,000
Cheers.

427
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,125
Mom, what are you doing?

428
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,750
Did you just get home from work?

429
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,833
Did you eat?

430
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:01,166
<i>I'm at home, cooking.</i>

431
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:05,125
<i>Are you tired from work?</i>
<i>Is there anything wrong?</i>

432
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,833
<i>Hm?</i>

433
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,416
<i>Hello?</i>

434
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,541
Nothing. I just want to chat with you.

435
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,291
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

436
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,625
A little. I'm celebrating with my friends.

437
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,208
<i>How do you get home?</i>
<i>Don't ride a motorcycle.</i>

438
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,583
Okay, I'll hang up.

439
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:29,541
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

440
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,166
Hi. You have a lighter?

441
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,208
You can use mine.

442
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:52,875
Okay, I'm good.

443
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:00,875
Damn. What a cool lighter.

444
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,958
Hey, you smoke foreign cigarettes too.

445
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:07,458
Did you steal it from your boss?

446
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,125
I'm joking.
But the lighter is really nice.

447
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,083
Where did you get it?

448
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,208
It's custom-made.

449
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:21,041
But I'm thinking of leaving it at.home.
People always borrow it and just take it.

450
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:26,500
Here, I've returned it.
Please be my witness, everyone.

451
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,541
I probably took it if it's missing.
What a cool lighter.

452
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,875
Today is the biggest day
of my goddamn life.

453
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,458
How so?

454
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,125
It might sound like I'm bragging.

455
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,125
But I'm about to start
a nationwide business.

456
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:50,208
It's like that game show
<i>Dreams Come True</i>. Have you seen it?

457
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,916
- How is that your dream?
- It is.

458
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,291
I grew up in poverty, barely scraping by.

459
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,333
I had to shoot the birds and lay traps
to catch the damn rats for dinner.

460
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,916
Sewer rats.

461
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:04,625
But now I’m in a suit…

462
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,166
…having diamond-cut steak,
with a glass of champagne in my hand.

463
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,250
What a crazy dream, right?

464
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,375
Is it good?

465
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,458
Champagne? It leaves my throat so dry.

466
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,666
I meant a sewer rat.

467
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,250
Sewer rat? Fucking terrible.

468
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,625
And how big is your business deal?

469
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,333
Do you know Mr. Kanin,
the owner of Kanin Group?

470
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,291
I'm familiar.

471
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:39,458
Seriously, I have so much respect for him.

472
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:40,791
I really want to be born as his son.

473
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,500
Oh, I went to his house the other day.

474
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:48,041
And damn, there's a painting
as big as the wall in there.

475
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,625
It's probably worth more
than a hundred pigs in my village.

476
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,625
Oh, and the other day,
I saw a girl sitting in the lobby waiting.

477
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,958
Didn't know if that was his sugar baby.
She's so goddamn beautiful.

478
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,625
Hey, you saw her too?

479
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,833
Oh, wow, she's like a model.

480
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,750
Yeah, you have a good eye.

481
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:08,750
I'm sure that was his sugar baby.

482
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,666
I'm so jealous.
And his secretary. Just wow.

483
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,083
You're pretty fun.

484
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,083
I'll get back up there.

485
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,000
See you around.

486
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,083
Fist bump.

487
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:26,666
Okay. Come on.

488
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,666
- See you.
- Okay, see you.

489
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:34,708
Hey!

490
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:38,375
That's Mr. Ken, Mr. Kanin's son!

491
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,500
My dad is quite popular with girls.

492
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,875
You're such a rambler.

493
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,666
Next time, you have to try it.

494
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,416
Okay, next time.

495
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,458
Hey, wait. Wait.

496
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,833
Here. I know you like it.
You won't run out of it now.

497
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,291
- Aren't these too many?
- Not at all. It's for everyone.

498
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,500
I bought some
useful herbal inhalers for everyone.

499
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,500
Don't forget to ask Xiaoyu for it.

500
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,833
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

501
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,583
Give me the room card.

502
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,208
I want to know what made you
move forward with our deal.

503
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,333
Didn't you tell Peter
about what I've done?

504
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,416
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Just don't mess it up again.

505
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,291
I promise I won't let you down.

506
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:57,416
And will we still be working together?

507
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,958
I'm only here to finalize the deal
before signing the contract.

508
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,000
That means we won't
be seeing each other again?

509
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,208
We might run into each other again.

510
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,166
Hey.

511
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,541
I don’t like to leave it to chance.

512
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:17,875
Can I have your contact?

513
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,958
You’re tough. I like that.

514
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,625
Are you inviting me to work here?

515
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:32,708
I'm not sure if I want
to work far from home.

516
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,791
I'm interested in you.

517
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,166
Crystal clear.

518
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:13,541
Well. If it's not about work,
please don't text me.

519
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,416
Have a safe journey!

520
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,875
FOR YOUR LIPSTICK
FROM A FRAUD WITH A HOLE ON HIS SHIRT

521
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,041
<i>Your mom asked me to help you.</i>

522
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,875
<i>Consider this a blessing.</i>

523
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,291
<i>But don't ever think</i>
<i>I'm helping you for free.</i>

524
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
<i>From now on, you'll be working</i>
<i>in a mine to repay me.</i>

525
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,750
<i>Didn't you tell me</i>
<i>you were going to look after your mom…</i>

526
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,750
He's not here.

527
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,541
We don't have money yet.
Can you come back later?

528
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,291
I'm not a debt collector.
I'm here to see my dad.

529
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,250
Dear, it's your son.

530
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,083
What the fuck did you do this time?

531
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,250
I'm buying our house in Wawee.

532
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,375
What the hell are you talking about?

533
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,291
Just go home.

534
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,458
I'm giving you one million baht.

535
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,500
The appraised value is actually
less than 500,000 baht.

536
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,458
Take the rest as a return
for what you've given me.

537
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,666
We're even.

538
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:02,791
Where did you get it from?

539
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:10,375
Just know that I can
take care of us without you.

540
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,041
Here, share with everyone.

541
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,333
Smooth out the left corner.

542
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,125
Yeah.

543
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,375
Get the other corner too.

544
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,833
Hey, who the hell are you?

545
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,583
I'm from EASY. My boss told me
to check your progress.

546
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,041
Seriously,
will it really be finished on time?

547
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,750
You aren't even halfway done.

548
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,000
It all takes time.

549
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,750
Cement doesn’t dry instantly like magic.

550
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,666
Hey, Uncle.

551
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:10,125
My boss said that if you make it happen
within this week,

552
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,583
there will be a big bonus.

553
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,375
Don't you want it?

554
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,250
Come on, I will also lend a hand!

555
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,916
- Bonus?
- Yeah.

556
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:22,041
My kid's about to return
to school too. Deal.

557
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:25,333
Hey, you lazy asses! Get to work quickly.

558
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,958
If I see you slack off, you're fired.

559
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,916
- There you go.
- Go!

560
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,666
Get your ass up, mustache guy.

561
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,500
XU XIAOYU

562
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:42,916
Is this about work?

563
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,250
<i>Where are you?</i>

564
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,791
You wouldn't believe me.

565
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,708
I'm rushing the construction
of our branch.

566
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:53,458
Here, I’m plastering the wall myself.

567
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:57,750
I'm sure we're good to open
by the beginning of next month.

568
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,208
Hello.

569
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,208
Hi?

570
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,791
<i>You have to calm down, alright?</i>

571
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,750
<i>I just found out</i>
<i>and am calling you right away.</i>

572
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,333
What happened?

573
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:19,000
<i>Last week, Kanin Group</i>
<i>proposed to Mr. Peter an increase</i>

574
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,833
<i>in the authorized capital.</i>

575
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,708
How much is it now?

576
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,916
<i>One billion baht.</i>

577
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,666
<i>It's a ten-time increase,</i>

578
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,791
<i>so all of the shares</i>
<i>are diluted accordingly.</i>

579
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,458
<i>I thought you knew about this since</i>

580
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,416
<i>there's a press conference</i>
<i>at Kanin Group today.</i>

581
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
I still have a 19% share.

582
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,333
Is that correct? Tell me.

583
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,125
<i>Your share is now 1.9%.</i>

00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,875
