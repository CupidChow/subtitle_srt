1
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:07,958
Linux.

2
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,916
The amount of packages is overwhelming.

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,833
You are in there
to speed up the belt, right?

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,500
You don't have to do it.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,625
Just come out.

6
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,500
Why did the conveyor belt stop?

7
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,416
Why is the conveyor belt not working?

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,291
I don't know. Suddenly, there's an error.

9
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,666
Ruijie, the conveyor belt system
is having an error.

10
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,000
Take a look and tell me what's wrong.

11
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,000
<i>The code that controls all</i>
<i>of the conveyor belts has been deleted.</i>

12
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,000
What? Who did it?

13
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,333
How long will it take to fix this?

14
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>We have to set up</i>
<i>the whole system again.</i>

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,250
<i>It'll take at least 20 hours.</i>

16
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,625
Every order has to leave by nine p.m.

17
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,541
We won't make it in five hours.

18
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,875
Hey. I can't be here forever. I'm out.

19
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,750
I already know who the mole is.

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,333
She manipulated the log file
in the server.

21
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,791
That's why I couldn't detect
the financial report downloads.

22
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,083
Check her laptop.

23
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,541
Have you been working for them
since day one?

24
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,041
Since when?

25
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,708
- Why did you do this?
- Why do you want to know?

26
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,291
Will it help you win this deal?

27
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,250
This place is going down anyway.

28
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
Even if I didn't do that,
it wouldn't make any difference.

29
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,625
Why didn't you just talk to us?

30
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,041
It's easy for you to say.

31
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:37,208
How many years do I have to work for you
till I can pay off my mom's medical bills?

32
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,000
Can you help me?

33
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,416
My mother is dying!

34
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,166
Answer me!

35
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,500
Go ahead.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,708
If you have something to say,
just go for it.

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,416
Send me to the police if you want.

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,958
I've been so harsh on you
and kept scolding you all this time

39
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,083
because I believed
you're the best among us.

40
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,083
It's my fault.

41
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,875
I couldn't make you believe in what I saw.

42
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,500
In five minutes,

43
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,750
if anyone sees you here,

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,666
I'll call the police.

45
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,333
Linux?

46
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,083
Currently, our "One Day" promotion
has received great feedback.

47
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,291
The total number of parcels exceeded
our estimates.

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,250
There are 40,000 more parcels
expected to arrive by six p.m.

49
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,958
We may not be able to sort it all in time.

50
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,416
Some must be cut off
and sent out the day after tomorrow.

51
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,541
Speed up the conveyor belt.

52
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,166
Uh…

53
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,916
But we've never gone
over 35 meters per minute.

54
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
If it's too fast, the sorting staff
won't be able to keep up,

55
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,416
and the packages
might get into the wrong slot.

56
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,375
Make it 50.

57
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
And add more staff to every station.

58
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,791
Right away, sir. I'll take care of it.

59
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,375
Dad.

60
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,208
Don't worry.

61
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,208
Look at this.

62
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,083
Here.

63
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,708
Your precious Thunder's
conveyor belt system is dead.

64
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,125
We're in the lead, Dad.

65
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,833
We can't give up. We have to keep going.

66
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,833
Even if the machine isn't working,
we still have our hands and feet!

67
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,750
Hey, look carefully
which parcels belong to which region.

68
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,333
Don't sort it wrong.
I believe you can do it.

69
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,291
Go!

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,958
Be careful. Check them carefully.

71
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,291
How are we doing?

72
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,250
Everyone in the office is here.

73
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,041
But it's still not enough.
We're not gonna make it in time.

74
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,208
Everyone, stop. Listen to me.

75
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,500
Take out your phone and call anyone,

76
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,458
your dad, mom, friends, relatives,
or even neighbors. Call them in to help.

77
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,791
Whoever finds someone,
I will give them 1,000 baht per person.

78
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,375
And if we can process all of the packages
before nine p.m.,

79
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,125
I'll increase it to 2,000!

80
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,208
This is the last storm.

81
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,541
By nine p.m., there must be
no parcels left, not even one.

82
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,625
Get your phone! Call someone now!

83
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,625
Hey.

84
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,125
I'll sell my car.

85
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,208
Call someone.

86
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:09,958
Is anyone there?

87
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,416
Bring them all. No need to eat now.
Come. It's 1,000 baht per person.

88
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Hey, everyone!

89
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,083
Everyone!

90
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,750
Hand the packages fast, but be careful.

91
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,458
If it's a sack, tie it tightly.

92
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:35,000
Scan the barcodes and hand them
to the handlers. Handlers, be careful.

93
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
Help me take the stuff out
of the truck, so other trucks can get in.

94
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,666
Go. Unload the packages.

95
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,875
Auan, open the door.
Pom, open the truck.

96
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,041
BOM

97
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,416
Bom, there's a problem
at the warehouse.

98
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,833
The conveyor belt is fucked,
so I need a lot of people to help.

99
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,083
We're going to be late.

100
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,166
Can you come and help out?

101
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,916
<i>You only call me</i>
<i>when you're in trouble.</i>

102
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,750
You said you hate those
who abandon their friends,

103
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
but that's exactly what you're doing, Bom.

104
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,916
Go, go!

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,916
The last truck to the eastern route
leaves in ten minutes.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,375
Hey, the eastern route is almost cleared!

107
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,541
Hey, meet me in the center.

108
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,625
Yeah, I'm going.

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,916
What?!

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,708
Shit! Put out the fire! Hurry up!

111
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
What the fuck happened?

112
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,875
Someone must have shipped
an old battery or something.

113
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,333
It took a hard hit and caught fire.

114
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,375
Everyone, be careful.
Don't damage the package.

115
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,416
This is unacceptable.

116
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,250
Cleared. What's up?

117
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,291
Packages for the Northeastern region
exceed the limit!

118
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,083
We only have one truck left,
and it won't be enough.

119
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,291
Xiaoyu, call more trucks in.

120
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,791
I'm calling all of them,
and none are available.

121
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,166
The ones that we reserved
had been canceled.

122
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,958
Huh? Canceled? All of them?

123
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,375
Yes, all 200 trucks.
They all went to EASY.

124
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,791
All those trucks?

125
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,500
Are they shipping
the whole fucking country?!

126
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,500
Sir.

127
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,375
So, are you having us deliver
something or what?

128
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,416
I've been waiting for an hour,
and I still haven't loaded any stuff.

129
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,833
Just hang around. That's your job.

130
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,166
Getting paid for doing nothing? Great.

131
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,333
Put more.

132
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,875
You can put more.

133
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,791
Be careful. Don't drop anything!

134
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,541
There are 6,254 parcels left
for the Northeastern.

135
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,583
We'll need two more trucks anyway.

136
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,625
Where are the trucks
heading for the Northeastern region?

137
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,541
The first truck just reached Saraburi.

138
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,583
Why?

139
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,541
Forget that idea. It takes six hours
to get to the Northeastern depot.

140
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
It'll be 12 hours if it comes back.

141
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,125
It'd be a total of 18 hours
if they had to come back and go again.

142
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,541
The "next day" parcels will become
"the day after tomorrow" instead, dumbass.

143
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,000
If over 6,000 items
get customer complaints,

144
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,666
Mally will deduct a ton of our points.

145
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,291
But this is the best we can do.
We have to.

146
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,750
Niphon!

147
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,541
Call all of the Northeastern trucks

148
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,291
and tell them to come back
as soon as they unload.

149
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,416
No!

150
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,125
There are still two trucks for the south.
They're still loading the packages.

151
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,000
Tell them to unload
and go the Northeastern route instead.

152
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,750
The fuck? How is that going to help?

153
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,833
The southern route will then be unable
to deliver all of the packages!

154
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,500
No, because we'll deliver
to the south by plane.

155
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,458
You said we don't have any money left.

156
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,125
I learned to adapt
from being with a reckless,

157
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,458
money-burning CEO like you.

158
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,958
I put aside a "last contingency" fund
for something like this.

159
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,166
But this is the very last one.

160
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,625
The company's brake pads
have turned into an accelerator now.

161
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,625
A flight to Hat Yai!
A flight to Hat Yai, please.

162
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,291
What will you be shipping, ma'am?

163
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,708
Five truckloads of packages.

164
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,666
Give me your ID card.

165
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,583
Let's go. Hang in there.

166
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,375
Bring in the five trucks
that will go to the airport.

167
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,583
Come on, come on!

168
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,333
XIAOYU

169
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:26,000
Niphon, Thong, Armie, Met, follow me!

170
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,250
- Make way, please.
- Please make way. Keep working.

171
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,583
Go on.

172
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,750
Say it.

173
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,625
<i>Sorry, it took a while</i>
<i>to find an available plane.</i>

174
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,708
<i>We are shipping with Fly Bangkok,</i>
<i>flight FX186.</i>

175
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,250
<i>FX186 to Hat Yai.</i>

176
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,583
<i>We need to get the cargo here</i>
<i>before 10 p.m.</i>

177
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,666
Okay. All the parcels
need to be loaded by 9:15 p.m.

178
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,916
Now, it's 8:30 p.m.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
That's less than an hour.
You guys think we can make it?

180
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,166
There's no such thing
as not making it. It has to be done!

181
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,333
The last five trucks, go!

182
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,875
Hey, what about me? What do I do?

183
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,833
Make yourself useful.

184
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,125
Let's go. Hurry up.

185
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,416
Hey, the second last truck,
load up quickly!

186
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,875
Don't just walk. Hurry up.

187
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,916
Open it.

188
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,333
Enough!

189
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,708
Here's water.
Take some water and drink it!

190
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,208
If anything comes up, I'll let you know.

191
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,125
Don't worry.

192
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,458
THEY'LL SEND
THE PACKAGES TO THE SOUTH BY PLANE.

193
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:40,833
What happened?

194
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,375
Nothing.

195
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,375
Logistics problem.

196
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,625
Let me go clear it up.

197
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,083
Clear?

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,291
So there's something.

199
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,708
They're shipping by airplane.

200
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,458
What airline?

201
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,416
Fly Bangkok.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,625
- What flight?
- FX186.

203
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,416
I'll take care of it.

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,666
- To Silver Sky Tower.
- Dad.

205
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm going to have a drink
with an old friend.

206
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,500
It's nothing.

207
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,458
This is the last one. Hurry up!

208
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,791
Push it up.

209
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,375
Close it tightly.

210
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,166
It's ready.

211
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Jumbo truck, go!

212
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,958
What? Niphon? Why are you the one driving?

213
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,625
We'll get there faster if I lead them.

214
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,833
Cool.

215
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,375
Airport cargo entrance is so confusing.

216
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,166
The drivers would get lost again.

217
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,333
Do you know how to drive?

218
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,458
The last Northeastern truck can go now!

219
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,041
Armie, are the southbound packages ready?

220
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,625
They're ready. Let's go!

221
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,750
The southern fleet is ready.
Off to the airport.

222
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,291
Go. Follow Niphon's truck.

223
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,416
DREAM CHASER

224
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,458
I heard you're from
the northern mountain village.

225
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,541
Why do you ask?

226
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,708
It's small talk, you know?

227
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,416
So that I won't be sleepy.
No need to be stressed.

228
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
We'll make it in time.

229
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,166
Where are you from?

230
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,791
Nakhon Sawan.

231
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,416
You got a wife?

232
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,833
How can you ask that?

233
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,083
Look at me. Do I look like I'm single?

234
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,000
Two kids.

235
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,375
I want to know more about you.

236
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,416
How did you end up starting
an express company?

237
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,666
I just want to be rich,

238
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,208
so I don't have to worry about my family.

239
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,541
You must get that.

240
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,791
Your wife and kids must be well off now.

241
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,000
Mm.

242
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,291
The mom is about to leave me.

243
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,083
But the kid is going to grow up strong.

244
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,541
Damn. Father of the year.

245
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,583
Good for you.

246
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,041
Let me tell you something.

247
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,916
If you're driving a truck now,
you must own one tomorrow.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Take whatever chances you get.

249
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,458
If you're already on the shitter,
you have to shit all the way.

250
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,708
Got it?

251
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,625
Why did you inspire me with shit?

252
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,000
And have you shit all the way yet?

253
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,125
I'm only getting started.

254
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,708
Now I know why it smells bad.

255
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,000
Damn it.

256
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,291
Fuck!

257
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,083
Out of all the nights, why is there
a fucking checkpoint now?

258
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,000
Fasten your seatbelt.

259
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,375
What's wrong?

260
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,375
Have you done meth?

261
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
STOP AT CHECKPOINT

262
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,208
Pull over to the left. To the left.

263
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,333
Hello. What's your ETA?

264
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,000
Half an hour?

265
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,500
Okay, hurry up. I'll try to talk to them.

266
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,291
Go around to the back. It's faster.

267
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,125
Hi. My trucks are stuck
at a police checkpoint.

268
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,333
What is the latest cut-off time?

269
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,250
For this flight,
we have to cut off in 20 minutes.

270
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,750
Registration book is good.
Stay for the urine test.

271
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,208
Okay. Thank you.

272
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,708
Whoever is done, just go!

273
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,291
Don Mueang Airport,
Fly Bangkok cargo. Hurry.

274
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,000
I've quit it, really.

275
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,583
How long have you been off it?

276
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,041
Yeah. It's been three or four days.

277
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,458
Where are you going?

278
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,958
I'm delivering packages.

279
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,708
Let me check this.

280
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,958
Did you take anything?

281
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm clean.

282
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,250
You sweat a lot.

283
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,458
It's hot, sir.

284
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,625
We'll see.

285
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,583
Done. Two lines.

286
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,791
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,583
Well. What are you waiting for?
You can go.

288
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,708
Two lines mean
there are no drugs in your system.

289
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,625
You're free to go.

290
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,208
- Go.
- I told you I'm clean.

291
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,500
Bye, officers.

292
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,416
Hurry.

293
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,958
Hey. I promise you.
I'll quit drugs for good.

294
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,375
I won't do it anymore.

295
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,791
Damn it.

296
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,875
Wear mine, so that you can drive properly.

297
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,458
What about you?

298
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,083
I'll wear yours. Come on!

299
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,250
Take the registration book with you.

300
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,333
Wait for me.

301
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,208
What's the matter, Niphon?

302
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,125
I'm sorry, Mr. San.

303
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,166
I haven't slept for four days.

304
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,125
I just needed some energy.

305
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,541
Bro!

306
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,416
Just a moment, Officer. I can't find
the registration for this truck.

307
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,666
Niphon's truck's book.

308
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,208
Have you searched everywhere?
Glove compartment?

309
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,625
I did. I called the owner.

310
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,500
He said it was in the glove compartment,
but it wasn't there.

311
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,041
What now?

312
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,875
Drug test comes up positive
and you don't have the registration.

313
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,041
We're confiscating this truck
for further investigation.

314
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,458
Confiscate? Can I take the truck first?

315
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,541
We're rushing to drop the cargo off.

316
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,958
Once we are done,
I'll bring the truck back around.

317
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,291
Whatever you need, I will cooperate. Here.

318
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,291
Take my ID card for collateral.

319
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,208
That won't do it.

320
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,041
The cargo can go,
but the truck must stay here.

321
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,916
You don't even have the registration book.
How can you take it out?

322
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,583
<i>Are you stopping</i>
<i>for a picnic, dumbass?!</i>

323
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,083
<i>Why don't you keep going?</i>

324
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,625
Hey. Send me more trucks.
We got stopped by the police.

325
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,875
ROUTE

326
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,541
There are no more trucks left.
What the hell do you want me to send?

327
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,666
Give me two minutes.

328
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,166
Guys, start SOS Backyard now.

329
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,458
Got it.

330
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,041
PICK UP AT THIS LOCATION NOW!

331
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,791
I've sent you a full company of cavalry.

332
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,041
Damn. Your app can do this?

333
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,416
<i>You've never listened</i>

334
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,458
<i>when I told you everything the app can do.</i>

335
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,125
STOP AT CHECKPOINT

336
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,541
Thong, open the trunk.

337
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,958
Come on. Park here. Come on.

338
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,166
Don't drop it. Hand it carefully.

339
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,291
You. Take this.

340
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,208
Untie the rope.

341
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,958
Guys, hurry up! Why is it so slow?

342
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:23,916
Come, I'll help you.

343
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
These guys are so slow.
Do you want something strong?!

344
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,041
Hey, you don't need to be here.

345
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,333
- Just head to the airport. Go!
- Oh.

346
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,375
Sir! I will shit my ass off
like you told me to.

347
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,333
And I won't wipe my ass!

348
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,208
I'll go deliver the stuff now.

349
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,333
Yeah, hurry up and go!

350
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,541
DREAM CHASER

351
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,875
A fucking company of only 20?

352
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,750
This won't be enough.
Can you send some more?

353
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,291
There's not even a soul left that zone.

354
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,208
The closest will take about 30 minutes.

355
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,708
Thong, you lead this group there.

356
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,333
I will stay back
in case more people show up.

357
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,541
Guys, follow me! Go, go!

358
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,833
Officer, I'm begging you.

359
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,541
He's usually very mild-mannered.

360
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,041
He never takes drugs. He never…

361
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,208
Oh, the registration book's here.
I've been looking for it.

362
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,541
Son of a bitch!

363
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,958
You're fired!

364
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,291
Here's the registration book.
I'll come get it from you later.

365
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,708
THE TRUCK IS LEAVING THE POLICE CHECKPOINT

366
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,833
Guys, hurry up, but be careful.

367
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,250
Then load them and weigh them right away.

368
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,583
Has the last truck left
the checkpoint yet?

369
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,666
No idea, ma'am. We took off before them.

370
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,541
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,083
Another truck is on its way.
It's almost here.

372
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,333
Can you wait for a bit?

373
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,291
Only five more minutes.
We have to be on time.

374
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,208
Have you ever ordered stuff online?

375
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,875
I have.

376
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,791
Do you want your orders
to come as promptly as possible?

377
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,750
Yes.

378
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,125
My company wants our customers to get
their packages as fast as they can,

379
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,083
so we need to rely on this flight.

380
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,083
And have you ever been on a plane?

381
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,458
Would you like the plane
to take off on time?

382
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,083
Let's go.

383
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:52,500
Where are you?

384
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,833
<i>Hang in there. I just left the checkpoint.</i>

385
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,583
Almost there. Give me three minutes.

386
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,708
<i>Okay, hurry up.</i>
<i>I can't hold the plane for much longer.</i>

387
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,041
Don't worry. I'll be there in time.

388
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,541
Shit!

389
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,083
GOODMAN168: DONE

390
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:01,500
KENNY: SENT A PHOTO
I TOLD YOU I COULD CLEAR IT UP

391
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,291
Park right here!

392
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,916
PACKING INSTRUCTION

393
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,541
Park here and unload!

394
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,666
Hello.

395
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,333
<i>Is Santi there yet?</i>

396
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,541
He hasn't arrived yet.
Can you contact him?

397
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,083
His GPS stops in the middle of the road.

398
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,750
He's not picking up my calls.
What do we do?

399
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,125
This place is nice, Nawin.

400
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,916
Mr. Kanin.

401
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Hello.

402
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,875
- One Michter's Rye, on the rocks?
- Rocks.

403
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,125
How can I help you?

404
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,125
I need a favor.

405
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,083
It's about your airline.

406
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,375
Hey! Please stop! Here!

407
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,041
Hey, stop!

408
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,541
Now! Take all
of the packages that are still intact.

409
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,208
Da, take a look inside.

410
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,208
Quickly, assholes. Quickly.

411
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,000
Hurry!

412
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,083
Can you ride?

413
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,791
I'm helping Thong out.
Don't get the wrong idea.

414
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,708
Quick!

415
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,291
Hurry up!

416
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,750
Da, be careful!

417
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,416
Go ahead! Go! Fly Bangkok Cargo.

418
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,375
Park here.

419
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,250
Hurry up!

420
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,625
Damn, you really came!

421
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,333
Be careful, dumbass! Don't throw it!

422
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:48,166
- Bom!
- Get off of me! You troublemaker!

423
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,375
You really came!

424
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:51,708
You two only bring fucking trouble!

425
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,125
Hurry up!

426
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,458
Hurry up and get it done.

427
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,375
Be careful.

428
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,583
<i>Why is the cargo truck delayed?</i>

429
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:13,291
There's a slight problem.
It's heading out now.

430
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,541
Hurry up. Is it done?

431
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:17,791
Can you wait for two more minutes, please?

432
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,458
No. Let's move.

433
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,875
Hey. We did it.

434
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,875
A lot of our parcels were damaged.

435
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,458
We can't afford to have
any more points deducted by Mally.

436
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,291
Let's go home. Turn the lights off.

437
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,791
CARGO CLOSES ONE HOUR BEFORE TAKEOFF TIME

438
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:52,916
The cargo is closed.

439
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,333
We have to carry the parcels
onto the plane instead.

440
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:57,375
Do it!

441
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,500
Don't disappoint me, asshole!

442
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,291
Hey. Go straight
to the passenger building.

443
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:24,041
I can't just unload a customer's cargo
off the plane just like that.

444
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,375
I understand.

445
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:28,458
That's why I'm telling you
that this is a special case.

446
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,416
If EASY closes the deal with Mally,

447
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:37,458
I'd like to invite Fly Bangkok to invest
with Kanin group

448
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,791
and start
an air shipping service all over Asia.

449
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,625
Does it sound better?

450
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,083
You can let me know
the flight number first.

451
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:56,833
Sorry.

452
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,333
This is urgent, guys.
Pack everything together.

453
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:05,083
I'm checking in for Hat Yai flight.
I'd like additional weight too.

454
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,416
FX186,

455
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,125
take all Thunder Express packages
out of the plane.

456
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,333
<i>FX186, urgent order.</i>

457
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,916
<i>Offload all Thunder Express packages.</i>

458
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,541
Roger that.

459
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,958
There's only one seat left.

460
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:39,458
You can go alone, right?

461
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,125
I know I shouldn't be asking this anymore.

462
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,041
But…

463
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,458
if Thunder makes it through,

464
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,416
would you…

465
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,750
change your mind?

466
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,125
Building this company together,

467
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,416
sharing this big dream…

468
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,958
is really good.

469
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,833
Thunder is your dream,

470
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,375
but it's not my everything.

471
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:52,083
I have my own dreams too.

472
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,166
You have to go now.

473
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,583
I don't understand.

474
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,583
Thunder Express is tiny.

475
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,625
Do you really need
to squash them down like this?

476
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,333
I don't expect you to understand.

477
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,375
You were born with everything.

478
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,083
<i>Some people have to build</i>
<i>everything out of nothing</i>

479
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,541
<i>with their own hands.</i>

480
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,416
I know how that feels.

481
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:17,208
<i>I know how much effort it takes</i>

482
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,083
<i>to climb up</i>
<i>until you are in the big leagues.</i>

483
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,375
<i>I get it completely.</i>

484
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,541
So, If I let them grow,

485
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,375
they'll destroy me.

486
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:37,166
Are you afraid
that they'll destroy you or your son?

487
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,375
Is it done?

488
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,541
That's all?

489
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,333
That's the only package
from Thunder Express.

490
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,916
My staff just reported this to me.

491
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,750
What was the flight again?

492
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,333
FX186.

493
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:18,208
That's correct.
Are you sure it's this flight?

494
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,875
There are a lot
of Malaysians flying on Friday.

495
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,041
There are two flights to Hat Yai
at the same time tonight.

496
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,500
We'll deliver to the south by plane.

497
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,458
Xiaoyu,

498
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,291
after you know the flight number,

499
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,250
don't tell anyone. Don't tell me either.

500
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,458
There may be traitors among us.

501
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:09,208
You must be the only one
who knows the flight number.

502
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,583
I only trust you.

503
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,541
FX184 has taken off.

504
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,666
<i>The western shore</i>
<i>of the Southern region</i>

505
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,500
<i>will experience mostly clear weather.</i>

506
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,083
Are you here to deliver the package?

507
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:30,458
Grandma, it really comes in one day.

508
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,125
Oh, why is it so messed up?

509
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,416
Please sign here.

510
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,958
Do you want some water?
We have a lot of water.

511
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,416
It's okay, I'm in a hurry. Thank you.

512
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,041
Hey!

513
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,041
Mom, Dad, come and take a look at him!

514
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,916
Hey, are you okay?! Hurry!

515
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:01,625
Sir.

516
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,375
Sir. Sir. Wake up.

517
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,291
Someone called you hundreds of times.

518
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,166
RUIJIE

519
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,375
What's up?

520
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,375
<i>Hey, where the hell are you?!</i>

521
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,250
<i>Mally is about to announce the result.</i>
<i>Are you going to see it?</i>

522
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,666
Hang on.

523
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,500
<i>I sent you the link. Join now!</i>

524
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,666
Wait. I'll find a computer.

525
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,416
<i>Let me reiterate</i>

526
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,291
<i>that the scoring is divided</i>
<i>into three categories.</i>

527
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,375
I got it. I'll return it to you soon.

528
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,333
- Feel free to use it.
- Thank you.

529
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:48,958
<i>First, the total</i>
<i>parcel delivered, which is 35%.</i>

530
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:53,666
<i>The second category is the loss</i>
<i>and damage rate, 30%.</i>

531
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,625
<i>And lastly, customer satisfaction, 35%.</i>

532
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,708
<i>The final score is now in this box.</i>

533
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,458
<i>Let's open it together!</i>

534
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,666
<i>Are you excited?</i>

535
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,333
<i>The suspense is killing me.</i>

536
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,666
I don't dare to look at it.

537
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,750
<i>It's here!</i>

538
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,875
<i>From the results,</i>

539
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:30,125
<i>Mally's sole partner for a whole year is…</i>

540
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,083
<i>Congrats!</i>

541
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,875
We made it!

542
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,833
We made it!

543
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,208
No one can beat us.

544
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,750
Implement the employee
engagement and communication plan

545
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,208
in the third week.

546
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,000
Develop a customer
communication strategy in the fifth week.

547
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,666
In the seventh week,
conduct due diligence with Finix

548
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,791
to assess the company's value
and review all contracts.

549
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,166
Okay.

550
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,291
Everyone's invited tonight.

551
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,250
Let's celebrate in advance.

552
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,916
I've booked a restaurant.
No one can leave.

553
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,666
We must have a great time.

554
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,916
Everyone must have fun. Ah.

555
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,916
Ken.

556
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,625
Thailand's market share is limited.

557
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,291
Competing with large companies
is very risky.

558
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:29,000
If we delay any further,

559
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,208
the company's market value
will further decline.

560
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:33,875
At that time, we will just be forced
to lower our prices for nothing.

561
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,416
But I didn't want to sell it.

562
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,333
He said he didn't want to sell.

563
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,666
Ah. I just heard that

564
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,750
FINIX tried to acquire Thunder.

565
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,083
Thunder was pretentious and refused.

566
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:49,500
Okay, I'll see how long it can last.
I don't think they can last long.

567
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,166
FINIX made Thunder an offer,
but they're not interested.

568
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,041
I don't think they will be able
to survive much longer.

569
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,958
It's not easy to get to this point.

570
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,666
You've done well to make it this far.

571
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,875
Let's have a drink tonight.

572
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,291
Okay.

573
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,250
Take a month off.

574
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,500
Come back when you're ready.

575
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,541
I should go work for FINIX,

576
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,833
or Mally,

577
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,208
or even work for Santi, shouldn't I?

578
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,625
Don't be silly.

579
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,000
Just like what Peter said.

580
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,583
"The father builds,

581
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,458
the son burns

582
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,458
and fucks it all up."

583
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,166
You're amazing.

584
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,166
You built everything from scratch.

585
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,750
But someone like you

586
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,375
will never understand how I feel,

587
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,000
the pressure I'm under,

588
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,541
the burden I carry,

589
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,500
or what it's like to be compared to you
for the rest of my life.

590
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:16,791
I've resigned from all of your companies.

591
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:19,375
All positions.

592
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,500
But…

593
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,958
I, being Kanin's son,

594
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,333
it is impossible to quit.

595
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,666
You're finally here. I thought
you had died and been born again.

596
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,541
Have you seen the email?

597
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,125
Mally's team told us
that we will need to change the API.

598
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:06,833
I was on it before the brief. Slowpokes.

599
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,291
What's that picture?

600
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,458
Xiaoyu's farewell party that you
were too much of a wimp to show up.

601
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,583
Wanna see? Open it and see for yourself.

602
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,375
Look.

603
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,375
She was about to leave,
but had the audacity to fucking laugh.

604
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:54,250
She was laughing for, like, two minutes.

605
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,500
When I told her you said goodbye,

606
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,666
she cried until she left.

607
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,166
What did you say to her?

608
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,708
I told her

609
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,458
not to regret anything here.

610
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,625
Well.

611
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,750
She's going to leave sooner or later.

612
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,708
And you, stop being a pain in the ass.

613
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,083
Hey.

614
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:00,583
Thank you for inviting me on this voyage.

615
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:05,333
You are going to build
a fleet out of this.

616
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,416
Mark my words.

617
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:22,208
2021

618
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,000
Pun.

619
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,083
Yes?

620
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,708
Help me read this.
What does it say down here?

621
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:02,791
Mm.

622
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:06,000
THIRTY BILLION BAHT INVESTMENT DEAL CLOSED

623
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,625
BECOMING THAILAND'S FIRST "UNICORN"

624
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,583
Mom.

625
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,041
Help me take the stuff out of the car.

626
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:24,750
Thank you so much.

627
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:34,708
Let's go inside, Mom.

628
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,291
Why are your pants so wrinkled?

629
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,250
Hello, Mr. San.

630
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,000
- Please take this to my office.
- Yes, sir.

631
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,416
What is going on?

632
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,333
Mr. Santi's mom doesn't know
that her son is the owner of this company.

633
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,750
He is telling her today.

634
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,750
- Damn, a critical moment.
- Hey. Keep it down.

635
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:39,416
Mom.

636
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,750
I have a confession to make.

637
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:54,250
So, I'm not an employee here.

638
00:52:56,791 --> 00:53:00,166
This is my company.

639
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,166
So, how many kilos do you have now?

640
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,375
<i>What's your problem?</i>

641
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:30,291
<i>What's your problem?</i>

642
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,208
<i>What's your problem?</i>

643
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,375
- <i>Come on then!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>

644
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:37,625
Thong told me
since the first day he got to Bangkok.

645
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,833
Hello. I'd like to make an order.

646
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:03,541
Are you tired, son?

647
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,833
I'm so proud of you.

648
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,750
<i>In just two years,</i>

649
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:27,083
<i>Chairman Santi Saelee</i>
<i>completed the Series E funding,</i>

650
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:30,875
<i>making Thunder Express's market value</i>
<i>exceed 30 billion baht</i>

651
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,416
<i>and becoming Thailand's first unicorn.</i>

652
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,916
<i>It is expected to expand</i>
<i>into the Southeast Asian market</i>

653
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,375
<i>in the fourth quarter of this year.</i>

654
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,875
SHANGHAI

655
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:16,125
DOORBELL CALLS

656
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:17,708
Who are you looking for?

657
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,500
<i>I'm delivering your package.</i>

658
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,000
Please sign here.

659
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,000
You've expanded overseas,
but you're still using the same device.

660
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:16,583
That's because it's tough as hell.

661
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,541
I thought
I wouldn't see you again in this life.

662
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:30,208
Of course, you'd see me.
I haven't returned something to you.

663
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:51,875
THE SUM OF 200 MILLION BAHT

664
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,208
This will cover your father's debt

665
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,458
and maybe enough to buy back
your childhood home that was taken away.

666
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:09,875
I thought you were going to pile up cash
in front of my house.

667
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,125
I actually tried.

668
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,750
But two hundred kilos
is too heavy for me to carry.

669
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,416
I'm disappointed.

670
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:27,875
Thank you for trusting me.

671
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,083
Ling Feng.

672
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,791
That's a beautiful name, the wind.

673
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,083
But when she's hungry,
she cries like a storm.

674
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,125
I have to go now.

675
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,208
Won't you stay for lunch?

676
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,208
It's okay.

677
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,166
I have a meeting with investors.

678
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,958
Say hello to Liam for me.

679
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:29,708
See you again.

680
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:55,291
<i>I'd like to thank my colleagues,</i>

681
00:58:55,375 --> 00:59:00,250
<i>both those who have walked the same path</i>
<i>and shared dreams with me,</i>

682
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,583
<i>and those who have stayed and overcome</i>
<i>the challenges together until today.</i>

683
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,208
<i>These are the people who truly make</i>
<i>Thunder what it is today.</i>

684
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,166
So cool.

685
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,708
<i>For us to learn, I think</i>
<i>we learn from many different people.</i>

686
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,041
<i>But there is one person who</i>
<i>is very important in doing business…</i>

687
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:18,041
Damn it. I'm out of data.

688
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,041
Hey, can you share your hotspot?

689
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,500
What the heck? I just topped it up, guys.

690
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:26,166
- I know, I know. Hurry up. Don't complain.
- I've shared it. You can connect now.

691
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,875
<i>Mr. Santi, what did you learn</i>
<i>from your enemies?</i>

692
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,708
<i>Is there anything you want to tell them?</i>

693
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,875
<i>Actually, seeing me</i>
<i>on this show is enough.</i>

694
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,916
<i>I don't think I need to say anything.</i>

695
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,791
<i>I don't need to say anything at all.</i>

696
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,708
<i>I think he knows it. He sees it.</i>

697
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:56,000
I heard you're retiring.

698
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,041
When it's time, it's time.

699
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:05,750
Won't you take other paintings too?

700
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,833
One is enough.

701
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,833
What will you do next after Series E?

702
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,958
Do you really want to know?

703
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,750
If you want,

704
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,625
there's a high price for prying.

705
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:41,833
One cigarette.
