1
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,166
YOUR LIFE IS WORTH ONLY THIS ONE BULLET

2
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,125
This is the only footage we got, sir.

3
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,708
Go check our parked cars

4
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,500
to see if they have dashcams.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,916
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,583
I'm going to report this to the police.

7
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,625
No.

8
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,583
It must have been some unhappy
employees or ex-employees.

9
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,500
They just wanted to scare me.

10
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,375
What if it's more than just to scare?

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,833
Santi!

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,208
Are you sure you're up for this?

13
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,833
But Mally wants the CEO to go.

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,583
Armie will drive you there.

15
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,125
- I’ll see you at Mally.
- What about you?

16
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,708
It’s not safe now.
We should go separately.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,208
Welcome,
our beloved express partners.

18
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,583
SALE UP TO 88% ONLY ONE DAY

19
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:15,125
I'm delighted and honored
to see you all here today.

20
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,000
As the CEO,

21
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,583
I would like to thank all of you

22
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,625
for being part of this journey
and for pushing Mally

23
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:27,916
to become Thailand's number-one
online shopping platform.

24
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:33,166
Last year, we made

25
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,583
more than 72 million deliveries!

26
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:41,083
All these parcels were delivered
by eight express delivery providers,

27
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,708
which are all of you in this auditorium.

28
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:55,083
Next year, the Singapore head office
is looking to elevate

29
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,416
our shipping services
to an even higher level.

30
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,291
And for quality management,

31
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,750
this plan will limit us

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,500
to working with only one express company

33
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:12,416
as Mally’s partner
under a one-year contract.

34
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:21,416
And now, the selection process
has already begun.

35
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,375
I want all of us to drink

36
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,083
this champagne and celebrate together

37
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,458
with the glasses that are about to arrive.

38
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:41,541
I ordered champagne glasses
from my favorite shop on Mally

39
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,000
and used different Express couriers
for delivery, as a test.

40
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,250
None of you knew about this test.

41
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,291
With the new policy
from the Singapore head office,

42
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:08,000
0.6% is the maximum acceptable
package damage rate.

43
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,375
In each package,
there will be four champagne glasses,

44
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,958
which means no damages are allowed.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,166
Let's see how many of you
can drink champagne with me.

46
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,583
Please open your packages.

47
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,041
Miss Mam, where is my company’s parcel?

48
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,416
Is that a question
for you to ask or for me to ask?

49
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,291
Hey, come here!

50
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,458
Be careful!

51
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,458
I'm sorry. I went to the wrong building.

52
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,791
May I borrow this? Thank you.

53
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,291
Here.

54
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,166
It's too damn hot outside.

55
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,875
I’m dripping with sweat.

56
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,791
What's going on here, boss?

57
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,833
A movie premiere?

58
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,125
- Can I eat those?
- Shut up.

59
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,208
That’s just a small chip.

60
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,750
It's not even broken!

61
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,708
A chip is still damage.

62
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,750
You can’t just blame my service.

63
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,625
Maybe it was the shop
that didn’t pack them properly!

64
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,916
They're all well-packed.

65
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,000
They're also picked up
and transported by art handlers.

66
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,541
We have video records
of every process.

67
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,416
You can have a look if you want.

68
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,291
A company this big chooses to find
partners with a party trick like this?

69
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,291
Bullshit.

70
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,708
Anyone who is not satisfied can leave.

71
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,083
We only want to work
with people who are willing.

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,083
We have 10,000 deliveries a day.

73
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,583
Please don’t be the one to fuck us up.

74
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,916
It's all good.

75
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,125
Congratulations, Mr. Ken.

76
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,125
Thank you.

77
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,583
Go check which rider delivered
this. They'll face me when I'm back.

78
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,750
Oh, I remember.

79
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,333
I rode over a manhole cover
on the way here.

80
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
One package fell out of the bike,

81
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,000
but I'm not sure if it was this box.

82
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,708
I can’t look now.

83
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:41,875
What's your name?

84
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,458
Uh…

85
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,416
It's Goong, sir.

86
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,791
I will never forget you, Goong!

87
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,583
The qualified companies are

88
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,625
FINIX, EASY, ShipSure,
Rocket Box, and Thunder.

89
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,291
But it might be too early to celebrate.

90
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,500
The contenders still have to pass
the final test.

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,208
So, you’ll be delivering parcels

92
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,541
on the busiest day of the year

93
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,875
for Mally, 11.11.

94
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,833
And whoever has the highest points

95
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,958
will continue to grow alongside
Mally next year.

96
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,000
Miss Mam.

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,958
Should we move the competition up to 9.9?

98
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,125
I’m afraid 11.11 is too far away.

99
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,958
Some companies may not survive until then.

100
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,500
We can't wait until Double 11.

101
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,250
We want to borrow 100 million

102
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,083
from you so that we can bid for Double 11.
If we win the bid,

103
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,500
we can become a partner of Mally

104
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,416
and guarantee a huge
order volume next year.

105
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,583
We will pay you back
with interest within one year.

106
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,125
<i>A hundred million is okay,</i>

107
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,041
<i>but I have conditions.</i>

108
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,083
What conditions? You say it.

109
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
<i>I don't want interest,</i>

110
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,958
<i>but you have to pay me back</i>
<i>within six months.</i>

111
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,291
<i>If you can't pay it back,</i>

112
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,166
<i>it will be converted into shares,</i>
<i>an additional 15%,</i>

113
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,625
<i>a total of 30%.</i>

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,375
Do you want to acquire shares this way?

115
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,625
You know six months
is definitely not enough.

116
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,208
<i>I just want to reduce the risk.</i>

117
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,291
<i>If the company goes bankrupt,</i>

118
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,708
<i>I should have the first right</i>

119
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,583
<i>to auction the company's property.</i>

120
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,500
The company is about to go bankrupt,

121
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,625
but you still have evil intentions.

122
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,708
- Viper!
- Calm down.

123
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,000
Go have some tea.

124
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,458
<i>The more you push yourself,</i>
<i>the more potential you can unleash.</i>

125
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,000
<i>If the company can get through</i>
<i>this difficult time,</i>

126
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,750
<i>you will definitely be able</i>
<i>to grow rapidly.</i>

127
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,958
<i>I believe in you, Ruijie,</i>

128
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,041
<i>just like every time before.</i>

129
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,875
How dare you raise this price?

130
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,208
Hundred million for 15% of the shares.

131
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,708
This is six times lower
than the estimated price.

132
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,250
<i>Don't make it sound like</i>
<i>you have another way out.</i>

133
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,791
<i>If you're ready,</i>

134
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,166
<i>you can fly here to meet me.</i>

135
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,916
We can’t let her
walk all over us like that.

136
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,333
There must be some other way.

137
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,333
Let me talk to the bank again.

138
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
I leave it to you.

139
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,625
Come on.

140
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,500
Yeah.

141
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,333
Yeah.

142
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,666
Go.

143
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,708
Look. He couldn't return it.

144
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,375
Yes?

145
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,250
What do you want?

146
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,583
Where's the Primrose room?

147
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,750
This way, please.

148
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,875
Thank you.

149
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,250
I'm surprised that you agreed to meet me.

150
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,625
Are the crab legs ready?

151
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,833
I'll go check, sir.

152
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,708
I'm just here for the dinner.

153
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,791
There's nothing wrong with that.

154
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,708
Good.

155
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,208
This is why I admire you

156
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,458
ever since the deal with Peter.

157
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,000
Among those at Thunder,
I think you are the most reasonable.

158
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,000
Let’s not waste any more time.

159
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,875
I want to buy your company
for 1.2 billion baht.

160
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,708
You'd better give me an answer quickly.

161
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,083
I hate waiting.

162
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,791
This dashcam recording
is the best we could find,

163
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,166
but the guy's face isn't clearly visible.

164
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,041
How much?

165
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,291
What?

166
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,791
This?

167
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,875
Forty baht.

168
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,125
This. How much?

169
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,041
What the fuck do you want?

170
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,291
Do I really need to say it again?

171
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,458
All you do is boss people around all day.

172
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,541
We kept working our asses off,

173
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,125
only for you to cut our pay.

174
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,708
You even fired your friend,

175
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,000
who came all the way here for you
since the beginning

176
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,875
and threw money in his face.

177
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,166
Seriously.

178
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,708
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

179
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,166
This is just a warning,

180
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,625
so you can stop being a dickhead for once.

181
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,750
Go on.

182
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,458
Hey. It's not funny.

183
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,625
Isn't this what you want?!

184
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,791
What the fuck is wrong with you?

185
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,500
Are you crazy?!

186
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,500
- Man up.
- It's not funny.

187
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,208
No!

188
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,458
- Man the fuck up.
- Stop!

189
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,625
No! I said I'm not doing this!

190
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,666
- Do it!
- No!

191
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,375
I said no!

192
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,750
Shoot me! End this shit!

193
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,166
No!

194
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,500
You know what?

195
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,625
Shooting someone is easy,

196
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,708
just like closing this fucking business.

197
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,583
Just one snap and it's over.

198
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,291
But what can you do to let thousands
of employees keep their jobs?

199
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,208
Show me how.

200
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,125
Tomorrow,
you will be in charge of the riders.

201
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Show them you are the real deal,

202
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,041
not just a tough guy
when you're around me.

203
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,833
What the hell is going on?

204
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,625
Don't fucking die and cause trouble here.

205
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,875
What are you fuckers doing

206
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,208
with guns this late?

207
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,208
Wow, nice tracksuit with embroidery.

208
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,166
Is it hot wearing that?

209
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,375
No. Very comfy, bro. Good benefits.

210
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,916
Shit, it's stinky.

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,541
- The tracksuit?
- You!

212
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,083
Damn.

213
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,625
Good one.

214
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,041
It's comfortable.

215
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,708
- It looks as good as you.
- Hey, Thong!

216
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,791
Bank quit and works for FINIX now.

217
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,458
He's now "Bank FINIX", am I right?

218
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,583
Bank FINIX my ass.

219
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,541
- New nickname?
- Bank FINIX.

220
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,333
Damn.

221
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,458
Hey.

222
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:58,000
I think… we'd better not quit for now.

223
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,625
I guess the situation will improve
after November.

224
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,750
Trust me.

225
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,291
I got promoted to head rider.

226
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,416
I'll take care of you all.

227
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,416
I'll get your salaries increased
by the end of the year.

228
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,250
Wow, Thong.

229
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,958
Congrats.

230
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,875
So proud of you.

231
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,375
You are one of the bosses now.

232
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,833
Big brother is an owner

233
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,000
and little brother is a head rider?!

234
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,875

It's not looking good.
They look really intense.

238
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,416
The warehouse flow is quite efficient.

239
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:27,375
It would be more efficient
if you moved the HQ to the inner city.

240
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,041
Oh,

241
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:32,875
we meet again.

242
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,375
What are you doing here?

243
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,166
I just realized
you wanted to sell the company.

244
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
I just want to give you guys
a soft landing.

245
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,208
For how much exactly?

246
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,000
After careful calculation, your remaining
cash flow is 23.5 million baht.

247
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,708
It won't carry you beyond two months.
You can't even make it to 11.11.

248
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,375
Your company is valued
at around a billion baht.

249
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,625
I'm offering you 1.2 billion.

250
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,208
That's quite generous.

251
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,916
All of your staff,

252
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,958
including Xiaoyu…

253
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,708
and Ruijie,

254
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,416
will stay under a new contract.

255
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,750
As for the CEO…

256
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,750
I'll think about that.

257
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,333
I'm being more than generous.

258
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,041
I wouldn’t want you to perform drinking
shows in front of investors again.

259
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,708
Who said I don't want to sell it?

260
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,541
Ten billion baht. Deal?

261
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,041
I've always looked out for you, boy.

262
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,041
Just like when I warned you
not to start a price war.

263
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,583
I know that you are also struggling.

264
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,416
Let’s see which one of us will fall first.

265
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,958
When the captain stops listening
to the navigator,

266
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,958
the whole ship goes down.

267
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,916

Not a single bank will loan us money.

270
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,375
We don't even have money
to compete in 11.11.

271
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,791
We're stuck.

272
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:24,416
You have to admit
that Kanin’s offer is the best option now.

273
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,708
At least…

274
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,000
you have to do everything
to save everyone.

275
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,208
If we drag this out,

276
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,000
we will have nothing left.

277
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,666
That's right.

278
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,208
At this price…

279
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,083
…you will have over 50 million baht

280
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,041
to pay off the debt.

281
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,166
What the hell are you talking about?

282
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,208
You're so desperate that you have
to show him our financial report?

283
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,875
I didn’t do that!

284
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,875
Someone in here sent it to Kanin!

285
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,000
There’s a mole in our company!

286
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,333
Shouldn’t I be the one to say

287
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,208
that there's a mole here?!

288
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,041
The same mole that wants
to sell this company!

289
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,416
Do you think it's me?

290
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,416
I built this company with you.

291
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,250
Do you think that it means nothing to me?

292
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,583
What does it mean to you then?

293
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,625
You have already given up.

294
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,666
Given up?

295
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm the one who has been warning you.

296
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,875
Then tell me!

297
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:35,958
Tell me how we are going
to make it through this.

298
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,958
- I told you all the time!
- I will believe you,

299
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:37,958
but just don’t tell me to quit!

300
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,333
I never tell you to quit!

301
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,708
I want you to be realistic!

302
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,916
Can't you see?

303
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,000
We have less than two months left!

304
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,125
Why are you still here?

305
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,375
Go back home and get married.

306
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:10,958
You don't need to tell me that.

307
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,291
To the airport, please.

308
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,583
I double-checked.

309
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,208
Two days ago, Xiaoyu
did download the financial report.

310
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,791
This is what she got.

311
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,250
Let me track her movements first.

312
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,500
We will catch her

313
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,750

<i>So, she wanted to sell all her shares.</i>

00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,041
Are you sure?

<i>If you don't have the money to buy it,</i>

328
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:48,708
<i>then I will have about 20% of the shares.</i>

329
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,375

what the fuck she has done.

Why so quiet?

338
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,041
Are you ashamed of yourself?

339
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,416
I've made up my mind.

340
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,166
Read and sign it.

We have been working together
for a long time.

343
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,000
I feel like I don't know you at all.

344
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,083
Santi, come back and sign.

345

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,750
Hey, don't! Give it to me.

362
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,458
- No, no.
- Do you have any other ways?

363
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,708
Can you come up with the money?
No, you can't!

364
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,958
There's no other way!

365
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,083
Nothing.

366
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,083
This is the only way
for the company to survive.

367
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,041
Trust me.

368
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,708
Hey.

369
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,166
- I want you to--
- Hey, listen to me.

370
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,916
You don't want to owe
anyone, right? Right?

371
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,000
Neither do I,

372
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,583
especially to you.

373
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,958
I don't want to owe you, you know?

374
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't want to!

375
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,833
Don't think like this, please.

376
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,458
You are not going to owe me anything.

377
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,208
You know why?

378
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,083
You will succeed.

379
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:27,375
You will build it up till its value
reaches tens or hundreds of billion baht

380
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,916
or even more.

381
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,958
It will go global.

382
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,000
I believe in you.

383
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,333
You can do it.

384
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,291
But I just might…

385
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,583
not be there that day.

386
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:50,708
I'm not letting you go.

387
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,125
Santi.

388
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,750
- You can do it without me.
- Stop.

389
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:57,833
I'm not letting you go.

390
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,125
I'm not letting you go.

391
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:01,875
I'm not.

392
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,125
Hey, don't you think too much.

393
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,291
Enough of this.

394
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,416
You should be thinking about

395
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,041
how we are going to win on 11.11

396
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,958
and become the sole partner of Mally.

397
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,875
You have to succeed.

398
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,416
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU WAKE UP

399
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,750
Why are you up so late?

400
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,833
<i>What about you?</i>

401
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,541
<i>Why haven't you slept yet?</i>

402
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,375
<i>Are you overthinking something right now?</i>

403
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,041
I quit.

404
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,958
But I gave all my money to Thunder.

405
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,625
We are collaborating with Mally.

406
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,250
<i>Look, the moon is very beautiful today.</i>

407
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,750
I'm talking about something important.

408
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,416
Leave the moon alone.

409
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,208
<i>It's true.</i>

410
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:11,583
<i>Do you remember how beautiful the moon was</i>

411
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:17,208
<i>when I proposed to you?</i>
<i>It's just like now.</i>

412
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:20,958
Really?

413
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,583
<i>Come out and take a look.</i>

414
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,208
Fine.

415
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,958
I can't see the moon from my room.

416
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,291
<i>You probably can't see it from your room,</i>

417
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,250
<i>but if you come to my room,</i>
<i>you can definitely see it.</i>

418
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
What do you mean by going to your room?

419
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,833
<i>Look to your right.</i>

420
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,875
Have you not returned to China?

421
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:16,083
How long have you been here?

422
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,708
<i>I've been here</i>

423
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,125
<i>since the day we parted.</i>

424
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:27,750
Have I made you lose trust in me?

425
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,833
<i>No, I'm still worried about you.</i>

426
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,875
I don't dare to go back alone.

427
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:44,500
I've hurt you,
but you still treat me so well.

428
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,166
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

429
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,041
Liam.

430
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,250
Wait.

431
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:55,458
<i>What is it?</i>

432
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,666
I have feelings for Santi.

433
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,333
Why did you tell me?

434
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't want to keep secrets
from you anymore.

435
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,875
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

436
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,125
I feel like if we can get through today
and look back on it ten years from now,

437
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:32,375
it will just be
a small episode in our lives.

438
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Do you…

439
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:44,166
still want to have a family with me?

440
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,458
No.

441
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,791
Not at all.

442
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,458
Having a family with you has always
been my dream, Xiaoyu.

443
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,208
Okay,

444
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,958
let me try again.

445
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,833
<i>Whether I succeed or not,</i>

446
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,250
<i>I will definitely go back with you.</i>

447
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay?

448
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:26,958
This is the last time.

449
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:29,291
Okay.

450
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,416
I believe in you.
You will succeed, Xiaoyu.

451
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:53,625
What’s the fucking matter now?

452
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,416
I’m too busy to console you.

453
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,250
Yeah,

454
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,958
just sit there and listen to me.

455
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,375
Why should I?

456
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,416
You can’t even convince a woman to stay.

457
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,375
Pathetic.

458
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,000
Damn.

459
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,333
I've thought about the 11.11 campaign
for many nights.

460
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,291
I'm not surprised.

461
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,208
You are a dumbass.

462
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,333
Donkey brain.

463
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:32,916
Your head was emptied
when Kanin kicked you off the bandwagon,

464
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,833
idiot.

465
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,416
Damn it!

466
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,625
Hey.

467
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,166
Xiaoyu has sacrificed herself for us.

468
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,750
You have to make it worth.

469
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,125
Mr. Ken.

470
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,208
It’s okay, Ms. Wan.

471
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,458
I've read all the follow-up emails.

472
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:07,083
It’s not that, Mr. Ken.

473
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,166
If there isn’t anything else,

474
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,291
you all are free to go.
I will brief Mr. Ken myself.

475
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,583
Wow.

476
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,166
What a dream come true.

477
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,125
An office that runs without a CEO.

478
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,083
Did Peter finally fire me?

479
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:35,750
Sit down.

480
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,208
FINIX has offered to buy us.

481
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,458
If we can't surpass FINIX's market share
by the end of the year,

482
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,625
Peter thinks this deal doesn't sound bad.

483
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,291
Isn't he underestimating us too much?

484
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:02,833
Did you know?

485
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,875
The day that I asked Peter
to make you the CEO,

486
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,333
what convinced him to accept you?

487
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,291
- Because I am your son.
- Yes,

488
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,333
that is the only reason
you are here today.

489
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,666
You still have time.

490
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,416
Show me that

491
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,375
you're good enough for this position.

492
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,916
End Thunder now.

493
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,416
We need their market share.

494
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,500
Hey. Hold the Bang Khen lot at the front

495
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,291
and let the Ladphrao lot
go through the belt first.

496
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,791
Go, you're already late.

497
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,875
Yes, Mr. San?

498
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,916
What?

499
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,916
Right now?

500
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:26,583
NONG BENZ KARAOKE

501
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,458
Niphon, please sit down.

502
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,125
What…

503
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,500
What are we doing here?

504
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,916
How much did Kanin pay you?

505
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,125
Stop fucking around. We're wasting time.

506
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:25,625
I was shocked.

507
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,500
- You were shocked?
- Calm down.

508
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:29,833
We all went through that.

509
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,541
You guys were so convincing.

510
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,750
You're all here now

511
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,583
because we have a mole in our company

512
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,833
leaking information to the EASY fuckers.

513
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,333
While I'm finding out who it is,

514
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:46,291
I want all of you to keep working
by keeping this mission top secret.

515
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,875
You guys are the only people I can trust.

516
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,583
So, the promotion for 11.11 is…

517
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,416
Thanks, Ruijie.

518
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:29,750
It’s a new day.

519
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,083
It's "Next Day" delivery.

520
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,125
Ship today, arrive tomorrow.

521
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,666
The fastest delivery in the market now
is two days.

522
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,458
On 11.11, when all these shoppers buy
discounted products,

523
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,000
how excited they'd be to receive them?

524
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,375
They've been waiting for that day.

525
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,583
They'd definitely want them
as soon as possible.

526
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,000
If we can satisfy them
by delivering the next day,

527
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,041
it is checkmate.

528
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,791
I have written up a brief plan.
Take a look.

529
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,916
No offense, Mr. San.

530
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:12,916
It sounds easy,

531
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,291
but we are too busy
with just our regular routine.

532
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,333
Won’t it be too much for us?

533
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,375
It won't.

534
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,125
We’ll merge branches to consolidate
drop-off points, especially in busy areas.

535
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,041
Every warehouse
must increase dispatch frequency,

536
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,000
and we’ll triple the number
of vehicles and staff.

537
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,375
Xiaoyu has put aside
enough budget to make it work.

538
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,916
That's clear. Leave the marketing
and communication team to me.

539
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,250
I'll find as many riders as possible
to join the team, bro.

540
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,458
Tech team, do you need anything?

541
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,791
No worries from our side.

542
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,291
The system implemented by Ruijie
can handle this high volume

543
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,375
of packages from the start.

544
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:51,750
The next two months are crucial.

545
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:56,041
We'll gradually close down
the low-income branches,

546
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,416
saving funds for only 11.11.

547
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,875
You'd better be so careful with

548
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,125
your budget because it's your money.

549
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,833
Don't let me down.

550
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,041
We're going all-in.

551
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,625
Let’s hope
that this won't be the last time.

552
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:16,708
This campaign will not only boost
our sales for 11.11

553
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:19,083
but also help us build long-term trust
with our customers.

554
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,833
The campaign is called
"late shipment is free shipment".

555
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:26,208
The team has released three
poster designs. The first concept is…

556
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:09,583
Yeah.

557
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,333
There you are.

558
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:18,041
Your boss has been waiting for you.
We were talking about a lot of things.

559
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,000
We finally meet.

560
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,875
We've only been working online.

561
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

562
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,166
Linux is doing such a great job.

563
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,250
She is the backbone of the office.

564
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,625
I always tell her

565
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,791
I couldn’t be more proud of her.

566
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,208
I agree. She's really talented.

567
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,500
Please excuse me for a moment.

568
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:45,708
Alright.

569
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,541
I want to quit after this.

570
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,541
You're a very good daughter.

571
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,416
Tomorrow, 11.11,

572
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:57,458
is the biggest day we’ve ever had.

573
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:01,958
We will see more packages
than we have seen all our lives.

574
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:03,125
We cannot fumble.

575
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,625
No missing packages, no damages.

576
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,375
Our fate depends on each
and every one of them.

577
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,375
I don't know

578
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,041
if we'll still be together

579
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:29,083
when this battle ends.

580
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,250
But today…

581
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,416
I want to thank all of you

582
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,666
for trusting me

583
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,125
and sticking together here

584
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,250
and now.

585
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,833
I don’t care

586
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,000
what makes you stay.

587
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,375
But I owe you, all of you.

588
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,208
Remember this.

589
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,291
I'll never forget any of you.

590
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,250
This is our last gamble.

591
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,416
We will be bathing

592
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,625
in the bright new day together!

593
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:36,416
HEAVEN GIVES US THE STRENGTH
TO WEATHER THE STORM OF 11.11

594
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,583
Whoa!

595
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,125
That sign looks straight out of a church.

596
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,500
Mom’s gonna be so damn proud.

597
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,375
The only thing left is to fix the UI.

598
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,666
I was working till morning

599
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,041
and I kind of passed out.

600
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,750
It'll be done in no time.

601
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,166
Hey!

602
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,291
I don’t know why you all

603
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:51,500
keep working your asses off like this,

604
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,375
but I’ve made my decision.

605
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,125
From my 26.09% share,

606
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:08,750
I’ll share half of it

607
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,375
with all of you.

608
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,041
It might not be worth much today.

609
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,208
It could be worth a fortune someday,

610
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,000
or it might not.

611
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:31,500
I don’t know.

612
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,666
I just want to thank all of you

613
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,041
for soldiering through this together
since day one.

614
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,375
Thank you very much, everyone.

615
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:09,958
This is the only thing I can give you.

How is your mom?

619
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,333
The doctor wants her
to stay at the hospital.

620
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:11,916
If we can get through today,

621
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,708
can I visit her someday?

622
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:57,958
