1
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:16,958
The person who will be the CEO
of EASY Express Thailand

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,250
is someone who has
much experience in founding

3
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:24,541
and managing many successful startups
under Kanin Group.

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,583
Please welcome Mr. Ken,
Kananut Sittivongpaisarn.

5
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,666
- Ken.
- Hmm?

6
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,375
I want you to lead EASY.

7
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,166
President of EASY Thai Express
takes office.

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,166
But what about the Wawee guy?

9
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,083
Are you taking him out?

10
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,958
…Kanin Group Co., Ltd.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,916
I never thought of putting him in charge
in the first place.

12
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,833
Mr. Ken, Kananat Sittiwongpaisan.

13
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,750
<i>Why?</i>

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,875
The champagne he bought.

15
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,041
It's terrible.

16
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,125
Dad, you're being cruel again.

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:37,333
Everyone, this is a historical moment
of the signing of the cooperation

18
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,791
between EASY Express Group China
and Kanin Group.

19
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,791
Please give another round of applause,

20
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:50,833
everyone, and this is
EASY Express Group Thailand.

21
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,833
It's official now.

22
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,791
A historic moment
for EASY Express Group Thailand.

23
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,708
What the hell is going on?

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,875
- What the fuck is going on?
- You can't get in.

25
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,000
Tell me.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,291
What kind of stupid event is this?

27
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,541
Are you guys stabbing me in the back?

28
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,083
Tell me!

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,791
Come with me. Don't make a scene.

30
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,083
There's nothing.

31
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,166
There was a slight misunderstanding.

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,541
Nothing. Just some personal matters.

33
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,916
What the fuck does this mean?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,125
A capital raised? Why is my share at 1.9%?

35
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,875
Peter thinks the potential is there
to start with a larger fund.

36
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,458
Everyone agrees.

37
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,708
This is a standard procedure.

38
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,583
You put in 19 million,
and that's still there, not one baht less.

39
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:40,291
From 19% to 1.9%?

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
This is my business.

41
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,958
I want to have a say in things.
I'm the CEO.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
What the fuck is your son doing
on the stage?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,083
It's necessary.

44
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,833
They want a CEO that they can trust.

45
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,208
You were deceitful, hiring those people.

46
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,333
I had to tell Peter.

47
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
He feels uncomfortable.

48
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,125
He thinks he can't let you be the CEO,
and I have to agree.

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,666
You agree?

50
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,291
Huh?

51
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,958
You fucking idiot!

52
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,041
You had it in you to steal
my idea from the beginning!

53
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,916
Asshole. I thought of everything.
I did everything to push the deal through!

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,500
I did pay to hear your idea, didn't I?

55
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,583
If you still want to explore
our opportunity together,

56
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,291
there are many positions available.

57
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,583
We would love to have
a talented employee like you.

58
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,833
Mark my words.

59
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,250
I will start my own company.
It will be ten times the size of yours.

60
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,416
Then I'll come back
and step on your damn face.

61
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,666
Well, you can try.

62
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,000
But I doubt you could be
any more than a small fly.

63
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:55,916
Remember this.

64
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,916
Let me go!

65
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,583
Let him go.

66
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,291
XU XIAOYU

67
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:27,791
<i>Hello.</i>

68
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,583
<i>I'm watching the live broadcast.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

69
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,291
- <i>What are you going to--</i>
- I'm opening my own express.

70
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,708
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

71
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,833
I need a tech team.

72
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,125
Find me the best person.
I want the best of the best.

73
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,041
<i>Okay. But you have to fly</i>
<i>to talk to him yourself.</i>

74
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,166
SHANGHAI

75
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,875
NORTH CLOUD HAS ACQUIRED MEET-U

76
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,458
LIU RUIJIE LEFT MEET-U

77
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,125
<i>I left EASY to found my startup "Meet-U"</i>

78
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,958
<i>because I saw more possibilities</i>
<i>and opportunities.</i>

79
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,916
<i>Starting my own company is more like</i>
<i>building a boat for the team to sit on.</i>

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,041
<i>I prefer to catch fish myself.</i>

81
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
<i>I have enough strength</i>
<i>to realize my dream.</i>

82
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,375
Thanks.

83
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,500
You should be Mr. Ruijie.

84
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,750
I'm Santi Saelee.
You can just call me Xiaodi.

85
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,666
I can speak Thai. I grew up in Yaowarat.

86
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,041
Great. So, you are familiar with Thailand.

87
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,041
Xiaoyu told me you are the best
of the best tech leaders in China.

88
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,333
You want me to join you
and open an express in Thailand.

89
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,416
What's more?

90
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,375
Uh…

91
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,333
Exactly.

92
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,666
I'll be the CEO finding us the funding
and taking care of all operations.

93
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,208
You'll be a CTO handling all about tech.

94
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,041
I'll give you six months to lay out
the system and finish the application.

95
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,416
I only need three months.

96
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,708
That's why it only has to be you!

97
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,541
I have made a list of initial milestones
we should hit.

98
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,000
When did I say I'm in?

99
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,458
Why do you want to start an express?

100
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,375
In Thailand,

101
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,708
there is no express that has
a delivery price that's

102
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,500
- as cheap as in China.
- As cheap as in China.

103
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,666
Exactly, when I was…

104
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,916
When I was in the sand port, I…

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You lived in the mountains.

106
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,833
You want to get EASY up there
but got kicked out by Kanin and his son.

107
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,208
Xiaoyu told me all about it.

108
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,000
Why do I need to do it with you?

109
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,208
Your startup got robbed
by a hostile takeover.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,333
If you do it with me,

111
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,958
there is no fucking chance
of that happening.

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,541
I need you because you're the best
at finding the fish in the vast sea.

113
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,083
And I will make you a worthy ship,

114
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,916
take you through the tempest
and get you where you need.

115
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,625
A moron like you can't manage a startup.

116
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,083
You came here in a suit.
You are stuck in your little box.

117
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,666
My ride's here.

118
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,708
Hey! What's with the rush?

119
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,916
Come to see the potential in Thailand
with your own eyes first.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,833
So you can realize what you are missing.
This is the plane ticket.

121
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,000
Have a seat.

122
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:40,958
Huh?

123
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,125
I already have the ticket.

124
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,541
I have an appointment
with Kanin Group next week.

125
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,333
Wait!

126
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,083
Tell me what day you are coming!

127
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,583
Huh?

128
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,250
Could you help me
turn it around? Thanks.

129
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,583
How about it?

130
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,208
Not so bad.

131
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,958
You too.
I think you look a bit like a waiter.

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,000
- I look like a waiter?
- Hmm.

133
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,750
Doesn't this look good on me?

134
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,666
I…

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,208
What about you?

136
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,541
You… You are you going to catch fish?

137
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,958
- Catch fish?
- Yep.

138
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,291
Like this?

139
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,791
A bit like.

140
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,083
You'll have to tuck your pelvis by then.

141
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,791
I haven't used the toilet yet.

142
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,041
Really? Tuck your pelvis.

143
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,791
Call me when you arrive.

144
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
- Okay. Be careful on the road. Bye.
- Hmm.

145
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,083
- Bye.
- Bye.

146
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,958
- Xiaoyu.
- What's wrong?

147
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,083
Dad's cake.

148
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,291
- I almost forgot it again.
- You almost left it for me to eat.

149
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,875
- I'm leaving. Bye.
- Hmm.

150
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,666
SUBPOENA

151
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,208
What happened, Xiaoyu?

152
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,375
SUBPOENA
FROM SHANGHAI HIGH PEOPLE'S COURT

153
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,666
Subpoena.

154
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,916
BREACH OF CONTRACT ECONOMIC
LOSSES AMOUNTING TO RMB 20,471,000

155
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,791
It's for my dad.

156
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,083
TAXI COMPLAINTS: CALL 1584

157
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,708
Hey, Ruijie.

158
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,166
Hey, talk to me for a moment.

159
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,375
How did you know I'm arriving today?

160
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,958
You told me you're coming here next week.

161
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,291
So, I've been here since Monday.
That's just five days.

162
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,083
Here, open it.

163
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,583
It's all for tech.

164
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,916
I have prepared ten million for you.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,791
Join us and you can use it how you wish.

166
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,125
Hey, wait!

167
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,041
Now you're wearing a suit.

168
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,875
You are a moron!

169
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,250
Please come in.

170
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,875
Right, Mr. Ken is waiting
for you over there.

171
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,750
It's an honor to finally meet
a living legend, Mr. Ruijie.

172
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:28,416
Hey, I just got some new tea,
Da Hong Pao Tea.

173
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,416
Just cut to the chase.

174
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,166
Why do you want to start an express?

175
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,375
Bro…

176
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,833
you're a tea-lover with a temper.

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Please allow me to call you bro.

178
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,666
You know…

179
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,541
E-commerce is in a strong upward trend.

180
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,208
FINIX gets into NASDAQ

181
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,666
and MALLY expands throughout Asia.

182
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,541
Personally, I think this industry

183
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,583
will only grow bigger and bigger.

184
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:18,583
But from the bottom of my heart,
I want to start an express

185
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,166
that is more economical, as in so cheap…

186
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,875
- that a boy from a hill tribe can use.
- That a boy from a hill tribe can use.

187
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,875
Who the hell drinks the first brew?

188
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,541
That's dumb as hell.

189
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,791
I was right!

190
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,458
I knew you'd tell them off, didn't you?

191
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,083
I know you are too wise to be
in the mud with those pricks.

192
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,208
Start the car.

193
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,916
Okay, where do you want to go?

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,916
To the airport.

195
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,916
What a damn waste of time.

196
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,291
The market in China is oversaturated.

197
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,750
But here, it's like a sea full of fishes.
You see it, don't you?

198
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,583
You think about it.
We have few competitors.

199
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,583
It sets the price at 50 baht,
we set the price at 25 baht.

200
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,791
It's already clear that this is
a big opportunity for the two of us.

201
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,333
Do I need to speak dog language?

202
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,875
So you can understand. I won't do it.

203
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,750
Hey, where the fuck are you going?

204
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,916
I won't let you go easily.

205
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,166
RATCHAPRUEK RD

206
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,375
- Stop the car!
- No!

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,416
- Close the fucking door!
- Stop the car!

208
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,458
- No, I won't stop! I won't stop!
- Stop the car! Stop the car!

209
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,125
- Stop the car!
- I won't stop!

210
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,333
- Close the door!
- Stop the car!

211
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,416
Even if you drive all the way
to Cambodia, I won't do it to you.

212
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,416
You are such a fucking bastard,
a pig-brained piece of shit.

213
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,750
Look at this. Our company fund.

214
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,875
Look!

215
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,500
What the fuck are you playing at?

216
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,083
Every second you refuse our collaboration,
how much are we losing?

217
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,000
Hundred thousand, a million?

218
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,166
Fucking see it with your own eyes.

219
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
Look!

220
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,041
Damn it!

221
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,958
Join me and you can have half the shares.

222
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,541
All the codes, all the tech license,
you can have it!

223
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,875
Are you okay?

224
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,833
Fuck! Look out, you idiot.

225
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,666
I know that you were hurt
by being betrayed, and I was betrayed too.

226
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,583
Betrayed by that damn Kanin.
I fucking hate that bastard.

227
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,750
I need to do something before I walk there
and burn the whole building down.

228
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,666
Fucking look at this.

229
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,791
Look! Look!

230
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,833
You are so crazy.

231
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,708
The licenses have to be owned
by the company.

232
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,875
Otherwise, who the fuck
would want to invest?

233
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,958
You need to hold the majority
of the share for maneuverability.

234
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,375
Give me 30, you take 70.

235
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,041
It will be a better defense
against a hostile takeover.

236
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,208
I will not allow
my company to be stolen again.

237
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,708
What the fuck are you silent for?
I'm going into this with you.

238
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,625
Oh my God. Come here.

239
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,625
Jackass, stop.

240
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,125
Fuck!

241
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,666
RUIJIE AGREED TO JOIN

242
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,375
THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION

243
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,375
Sorry.

244
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:28,250
Xiaoyu, I'm sorry.

245
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,125
The meeting lasted too long.

246
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,166
Have you ordered?

247
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,750
Yes, the same as usual.

248
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,625
What's wrong?

249
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,166
Are you okay?

250
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,791
You don't want to break up
with me, do you?

251
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,541
Why do you say that?

252
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,166
Normally, we only come to this restaurant
on our anniversaries.

253
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,791
On the way here just now,
I was thinking if you'd say,

254
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,875
"Liam,

255
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
I met the right person,

256
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,625
and I just met him at noon.

257
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,166
Let's break up."

258
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,916
What's wrong with you?
Why should I break up with you?

259
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,416
You startled me.

260
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,125
XIAOXIAO RESTAURANT

261
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,541
Excuse me. I'm here for an interview.

262
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,625
Second floor.

263
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,416
Okay, okay.

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,833
Here comes an interviewee.

265
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,291
Okay, let him come up.

266
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,416
JOB INTERVIEW

267
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,291
Please come in.

268
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,333
This is my portfolio that I've prepared.

269
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,250
Below are the awards for coding
that I have received.

270
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,625
Hmm.

271
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,750
Mr. Supakorn.

272
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,083
Yes, sir.

273
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
Why do you want to work here?

274
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to be a part of a startup,

275
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,166
inventing the wheel.

276
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
Tell me your most recent lie.

277
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,583
Yes?

278
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,666
Tell me your most recent lie.

279
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,416
Oh, I'm not someone who lies.
I just don't like lying.

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,208
Ok, thanks. You can go now.

281
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,750
Actually, in the file,
there was a national award…

282
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,750
The interview is concluded. Please leave.

283
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,791
I didn't make the cut at my last job.

284
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,958
I told my mom I quit
but actually was let go.

285
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,833
If I don't get this job,
I'm worried that she will be worried.

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
Go tell your mom at home.

287
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Get out!

288
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,708
Can you chill a bit?
Why not ask him more about other things?

289
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,750
He can't even tell us
about his stupid lies.

290
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,083
You think if he messed up at work,
he would speak up?

291
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,666
You're the fuck.

292
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,458
Another one, hurry up.
I'm about to open the shop.

293
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,166
I've prepared everything, incentive,

294
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,416
timesheet, how to make DEV value
an asset, revenue projection.

295
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,875
You guys don't have to worry.

296
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,708
I want to be a CFO and will manage
all the financials and back office.

297
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,416
So you guys can focus
on improving the product.

298
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,916
What's your rate?

299
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,458
I'm flexible. You can come up with it.

300
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,708
But on one condition.
I want an equity package.

301
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,583
Okay. Give us 500 million
and you can have some shares.

302
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,041
You must have had a lot of deep issues
with your past co-founders.

303
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,791
It's none of your damn business!

304
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,000
Just keep your mouth shut
if your words are nonsense.

305
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,500
I don't want to take advantage of you.

306
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,208
I just need a share.

307
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,541
I'm going to give this money to my father
to pay off his debts.

308
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,208
Go to another place to beg for food.

309
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,916
How much is your debt?

310
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,125
One hundred million baht.

311
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,666
Your father must be a gambler.
Don't be ridiculous. Just dream on…

312
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,250
Tell us about your most recent lie.

313
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
It's a part of the interview.

314
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,291
I lied to my fiance because of you guys.

315
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,833
A startup in Thailand
has sent me an offer.

316
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,416
Which one? Did you know it before?

317
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,041
He used to work for EASY Thailand

318
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,000
and now he wants
to start his own business.

319
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,250
When I first met him,
I thought he was quite interesting.

320
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,166
There was another person named Ruijie who
was in charge of the technical department.

321
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,125
When I was at EASY,

322
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,791
he won the Best Employee Award
for five consecutive years.

323
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,250
He sounds pretty awesome.

324
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,541
What do you want to say?

325
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,250
They want me to be CFO

326
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,666
and then give me shares,

327
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,500
so can our wedding…

328
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,000
be postponed?

329
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,416
Xiaoyu,

330
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,833
I know you are worried
about your father's lawsuit.

331
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,208
I can help you pay the money back

332
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,125
and you don't have to pay me back, okay?

333
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,958
If you are not at ease,
you can pay me back slowly.

334
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,583
It's 20 million RMB.

335
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:02,458
I can't pay it back
even if I work for a lifetime.

336
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,875
Can I handle my family affairs by myself?

337
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,208
But we are a family now.

338
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,458
Huh?

339
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,750
Xiaoyu,

340
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,041
let me stay with you, okay?

341
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,958
You know that I ignored those
who said I was a gold digger.

342
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,958
I know you haven't used my money.

343
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,333
I also know you don't like to owe others,

344
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,958
but the situation is different this time.

345
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:46,125
It's normal for us to help each other
when we encounter problems.

346
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,000
A 20 million crisis.

347
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,583
If I ask you for help,

348
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,791
I will feel like a rat falling
into a rice jar.

349
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,666
Liam,

350
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,750
they will give me 5% of the shares.

351
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,458
Can you give me two years?

352
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,291
I will definitely pay off the debt,

353
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,833
and then I will resign immediately
and come back to you.

354
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,708
Can you wait for me?

355
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,750
If I say no, will you scold me?

356
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,125
What do you mean?

357
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,833
Go.

358
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,500
Go ahead.

359
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,333
I want 5% equity,
the amount I have lied to my fiance.

360
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,083
Go tell your fiance at home.
I won't give it to you.

361
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,541
Give me two years.

362
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,083
I'm confident we can take this company
to two billion baht.

363
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,083
Why not ten billion baht?

364
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,500
Make it a trillion baht!
It's all fucking fart at this point.

365
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,250
You are great with product and tech.
There is no doubt about that.

366
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,791
But over 80% of startups fail
from their weak finances.

367
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,041
You know it well.

368
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,416
- What did you say? Say it again.
- Stop. Deal.

369
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,958
Xiaoyu's 5% of the share will be deducted
from mine. I'd still have 65% left.

370
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,333
That's enough to retain the majority.

371
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,500
Your 30% is untouched. Is that okay?

372
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,791
You want someone with a hundred million
baht of debt to take care of our money?

373
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:36,916
She can't even take care of herself!

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,208
The shit load of debt means her back
is also against the wall.

375
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,625
Someone like her will never back down.

376
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:50,916
I'm not changing the name of the company.

377
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Only big partners are allowed.

378
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,125
SR is from Santi and Ruijie.

379
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,666
I'm fine with that.

380
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,250
Come on. I get revenge.
You pay off your debt.

381
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,541
And you can try it again.

382
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,166
Like a company of crazy bastards.

383
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,000
Isn't this too risky for your liking?

384
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,625
I'm fine with an all-in
when the card is good.

385
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,833
You're smiling too much.
It makes me wanna puke.

386
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,208
JOB INTERVIEW

387
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,750
This is the newest version
as per your feedback, Mr. Ken.

388
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,083
The new interface you wanted us to fix,

389
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,541
we redesigned it to feel
more comfortable to the eye.

390
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,958
You can try it.
I think our app is very easy to use.

391
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,000
ESTIMATE SHIPPING FEE
MY PACKAGE

392
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,875
Oh, it's beautiful.

393
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,750
And how accurate
is our car location tracking system?

394
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:49,333
We've tested it to the utmost, and it's
moved no more than three meters, Mr. Ken.

395
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,041
Please continue.

396
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,500
Okay.

397
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,250
Please continue.

398
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,416
Yes, sir. Uh…

399
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,666
We only have the GPS function
left to implement,

400
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,750
and we believe the full app
will be ready to deploy in 20 days.

401
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,041
There are a lot
of long holidays this month.

402
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,208
I want it by the end of this week.

403
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,416
Mr. Ken, I think the time…

404
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:24,625
Alright then.
Let's review it together this Friday.

405
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,708
Please take care of it for me.

406
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,125
That's it for today. Thank you, everyone.

407
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,125
What are you so worried about?

408
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,750
Why is this painting here?

409
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,625
The interior team chose it.

410
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:57,916
Why?

411
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,083
Is it too relaxing?

412
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:05,125
I'll have it replaced then.

413
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,791
If it's about Ruijie,
there's nothing to worry about.

414
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,916
Our CTO graduated
at the top of his MIT class.

415
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,208
We've got it.

416
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,416
And we'll launch our product
in three months.

417
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,583
That's a month ahead
of the proposed deadline.

418
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,708
Am I worrying too much,
or are you just being careless?

419
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,083
Okay.

420
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,666
Miss Wan.

421
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,625
- Yes.
- Let the team know

422
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,125
that the timeline has been
moved up by one month.

423
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,083
I will greenlight
all the resources they need.

424
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,041
Alright.

425
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,291
I will find you a new painting.

426
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:08,375
ELIZABETH HOTEL

427
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,291
We will use this
as our temporary base for now.

428
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:17,000
This is where we work,
and I already got us separate bedrooms.

429
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,166
It's like camping style.

430
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,333
That's a good idea.

431
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:26,541
Good idea. I think we should
have a trip this weekend.

432
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,208
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,583
- Yes, and make coffee.
- Tell me when.

434
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,541
We are starting with the demo app,

435
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,541
so the CEO has a prototype
to show to the investor.

436
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,416
Frontend team, go ahead
and start working on the UI.

437
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,458
I've mailed you the wireframe.

438
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,291
Right now?
We haven't even sat down properly.

439
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,083
Then sit the fuck down now?

440
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,541
Backend team, check the feature list.

441
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,375
I'll handle the tracking.
Split the rest among yourselves.

442
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:00,208
It's so detailed.
We have eight people.

443
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:03,750
I think this will take us two weeks.

444
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,625
For us, it probably takes just a week.

445
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,791
You all have three days.

446
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,708
Boss, are you out of your mind?

447
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,416
With this many features,
even with 20 people, it's still a stretch!

448
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,000
Working for me,
there's only one fucking rule.

449
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,500
If you can't do it, then get the fuck out.

450
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,416
What the fuck are you staring at?

451
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:37,208
These are the names
for VCs and CVCs of all sizes.

452
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:40,833
We need to start pitching
as soon as possible.

453
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,083
I mean,
we have to find rich people, right?

454
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,333
I'll try contacting these rich people.

455
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,750
There must be someone who wants to invest.

456
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,333
Hello. I'm Santi.

457
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,416
Hello. I'm from SR Express.

458
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Anyway, I'm from SR Express.

459
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,541
Within two years,

460
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,166
our company will grow to 2,000 million.

461
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,833
- That's good.
- I'm from SR Express.

462
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,083
Can I leave you my business card?

463
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,250
- Sure.
- Yes, you're welcome.

464
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,041
Yes, Mr. Sakorn.
Can I just e-mail you the details?

465
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,000
Get someone to fix

466
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:49,958
the fucking air-con.
It's leaking on my desk

467
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,250
like it's fucking Andaman Sea.

468
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,583
Damn! Fucking Losers.

469
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,166
MY HOBBY IS COLLECTING LUXURY CARS

470
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:04,041
Our SR Express is just like
your Ferrari 430 Scuderia, sir.

471
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,291
It's fast, packs a lot of punches,
and won't let you down.

472
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,083
Oh, I already sold that one.

473
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,333
I'll make a mental prayer
for you to be successful.

474
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,416
No, sorry.

475
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:21,791
Coffee, Chupa-Chups,

476
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,875
- cigarette, M-100 are here.
- When the fuck will you finish?

477
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,791
- Hey.
- Tomorrow,

478
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,958
Tee Lek has to go to pitch.

479
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:26,916
Hurry up.

480
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,416
What the fuck is that noise?
Hey, get out of my way.

481
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,541
We're almost there.

482
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,958
Why are you hiding here?

483
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,208
Hey, wake up.

484
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:45,250
Hey, wake up.

485
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,916
I would like to continue
from what I mentioned earlier.

486
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,833
I forgot to give my business card.

487
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,333
Hey, wake up.

488
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,750
As we already know that…

489
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,625
Wake up, dammit.
The air conditioner is broken.

490
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,125
Fix it roughly first. I'll call
a technician to fix it properly for you.

491
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,583
Are you serious?

492
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,458
This is a demo of our application.

493
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,333
- Are you interested?
- It's okay. Thank you.

494
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,750
Hello, Mr. Atirut.
Is it convenient for you to meet?

495
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,458
Yes, I'm Santi from SR Express.
We met at SVCC.

496
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:28,166
Our application is designed
to be very easy to use.

497
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,666
The investor we'll meet tomorrow
has invested in hospitals and healthcare.

498
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,750
Maybe I should try to start with welfare.

499
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,291
What do you think?

500
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:20,166
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD MY RELATIVES
ABOUT POSTPONING THE WEDDING

501
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,541
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT
SO GIVE IT YOUR ALL

502
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,041
How many days have you gone without sleep?

503
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,250
Four days. Why?

504
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,083
How the heck did you hold up?

505
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,166
I haven't seen you eat anything
but those cups of tea.

506
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,166
Kanin is launching soon.

507
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,833
How did you know?

508
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:01,166
He sent you an invitation.

509
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,125
Good afternoon, everyone.

510
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:26,333
Getting to today is by no means "EASY".

511
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:32,958
First, I would like to talk
a little bit about my inspiration.

512
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,458
It all started with my friend,

513
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:39,041
a kid born and raised in the mountains.

514
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,833
Needless to say, he grew up in poverty.

515
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,833
He told me the rodents
were the main source of meat.

516
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,291
When he grew up,

517
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,833
my friend saved up his money

518
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,208
to buy a box of cookies.

519
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,000
He wanted to send it back to his home,

520
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,500
as a Christmas gift for his mother.

521
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,583
But he couldn't…

522
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:09,208
because the delivery fee
was too expensive.

523
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,791
Fifty baht,

524
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,000
which isn't much for many of us here.

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,708
But 50 baht for some people
is too expensive.

526
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,916
I want to tell my friend that

527
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,208
I have fulfilled your dream.

528
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:42,708
We are about to have an express
with Economy price

529
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,791
and Business-class service.

530
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,458
And rural people
will have the same costs as city people.

531
00:36:55,791 --> 00:37:00,125
EASY Express is launching today

532
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,000
with 500 branches across Thailand,

533
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:08,541
and the delivery fee starts at 25 baht!

534
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,666
And at this price, we will grow together.

535
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:26,833
Please give a round
of applause to Mr. Ken, our CEO.

536
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,625
In China,

537
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:33,125
if someone copies your business model,
that means it works.

538
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,125
It means the 25 baht fee you've set…

539
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,208
SHIPPING FEE STARTS AT 25 BAHT

540
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,125
…is right.

541
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,833
It's happening now, everyone.

542
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:42,125
On this occasion,
I would like to invite Mr. Kanin,

543
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:46,166
Chairman, and, of course, our executives

544
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,083
and presenter of EASY Express Thailand,

545
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,041
Mr. Tommy, on stage.

546
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,125
What the hell are you doing?

547
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,791
I'm tapping into my source of motivation.

548
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,625
Hello?

549
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,375
Yes.

550
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,125
Yes, I'm her daughter.

551
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,041
Here's the thing.
The 25-baht price point?

552
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,666
We actually came up with it before EASY.

553
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,666
It was them who copied us.

554
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,208
Wait a minute. Please listen first.

555
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:37,916
Damn!

556
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,833
Everyone said the same thing.

557
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,458
Just calm down a bit.

558
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:44,125
Let's find a new killer feature
for our product.

559
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,791
EASY, FAST, RELIABLE
START AT 25 BAHT NATIONWIDE

560
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,916
I hate that face!

561
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,833
HIGH PRICE

562
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,375
LOW PRICE

563
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,166
HIGH QUALITY

564
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,458
LOW QUALITY

565
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:18,000
FINIX has a lot of branches,
user-friendly but higher price.

566
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,250
EASY has a lot of branches,
very user-friendly, low price.

567
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,333
Our SR is right here.

568
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,541
We will start at ten baht,
our killer feature. We'll sure win.

569
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,041
If we deliver 100,000 packages per day,
we would lose 45 million a month.

570
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,583
540 million per year.

571
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,375
How long will it take us to break even?

572
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,958
I know. It was a joke.

573
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,375
We can't go lower than 25 baht.

574
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,833
We can't cross this line.

575
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,166
HIGH QUALITY, SR

576
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:04,833
We have to be here.

577
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,625
We can't be cheaper.
We need to have higher quality.

578
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,958
That's not too hard.
Just have more branches.

579
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,708
If you want to match them
in the number of branches,

580
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,625
we would need at least a billion.

581
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,625
How many investors do we have left?

582
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:22,791
In Thailand, almost none.

583
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:26,250
I have contacted foreign investors.

584
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,000
I've emailed over 20 people,
but no response yet.

585
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,208
Trust me. We will find at least one.

586
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,041
Fucking investor, where are you?
I'll find you.

587
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,208
What's going on?

588
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,791
Linux, calm down, calm down.

589
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,250
Calm down. I'll talk to him, okay?

590
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,666
I'll talk to him.

591
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,875
- Calm down.
- What happened? Where are you heading?

592
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,375
Linux's mom needs emergency surgery.

593
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,875
Linux wants to go see her mom.

594
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,333
But Ruijie said no.

595
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,541
That guy is heartless! That's her mom.

596
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,916
Okay.

597
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,166
Let me take you. Which hospital?

598
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,250
Take care of things for me.
I'll be right back.

599
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,500
Linux, calm down.

600
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,791
You go talk to him.
I won't talk to him anymore.

601
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,291
Get in the car.

602
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:21,541
Room 502, right?

603
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,750
Admit or…

604
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,916
Can you ask the doctor for me

605
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,875
if it's possible for my mom
to continue her treatment at home?

606
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,250
Okay, thank you.

607
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,791
You can stay with your mom.
Don't worry about work.

608
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:52,625
It's about money, isn't it?

609
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,833
Let your mom rest in the hospital.

610
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,750
I've got you covered.
You can pay me back later.

611
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,125
No… It's alright… It's…

612
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,791
It's your mother.

613
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,166
Let's look after her well.
Come back to work when you are ready.

614
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,208
Thank you. But…

615
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,750
I don't think I'll go back to work.

616
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,166
Ruijie had fired me already
when I walked out the door

617
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,958
because I needed to see my mom.

618
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,333
Are you joking?

619
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:46,708
I didn't have time.

620
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:47,708
Then fucking manage your time!

621
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,000
Who would want to work with you
if you're this annoying?

622
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,291
- Who the hell is willing to take this?
- Stop!

623
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,500
I told you. If you can't do it,

624
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:56,750
- then go home and clean toilets.
- Enough!

625
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,458
Stop arguing!

626
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,333
You are a piece of shit
and so is your team.

627
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,875
Then do it on your own.
I'm not hiring any more people.

628
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:11,083
Stop talking shit to people, I beg.

629
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,000
The hell you're begging for?

630
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,291
Have you got the fucking funding?

631
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,125
Do we need to be starving to death first?

632
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,125
You're useless. No wonder even Kanin
doesn't want a sucker like you on board.

633
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,625
Fuck you! Asshole

634
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,833
You think you're good?

635
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:23,833
Calm down.

636
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,958
Come on!

637
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:28,625
Come on!

638
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,041
Hello, yes.

639
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,708
Really? Okay, thank you.

640
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,791
The hell
are you doing with that flashlight?

641
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,625
- Santi, stop. An investor called.
- Who?

642
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,333
Alice Wang, a Chinese investor.

643
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,666
We have to leave right now! She is
about to board the plane in an hour.

644
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's go.

645
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,375
Let's go.

646
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,125
I'm going too.

647
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,625
Are we gonna fucking go?

648
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:30,375
I buy the ticket online.
We need to talk to Alice at the gate.

649
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,125
Take the next right onto the tollway.
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

650
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,083
Why the hell
are you parking here now?

651
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:46,083
Look at EASY. So many people
wait in line as if there's free lunch.

652
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:49,666
Our future customers…
Move out of the fucking way!

653
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,625
EASY, FAST, RELIABLE
START AT 25 BAHT NATIONWIDE

654
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:05,791
Excuse me.

655
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,041
Check in for Chiang Mai flight.

656
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,208
Wait a moment.

657
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,291
How much time do we have?

658
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,791
The flight is boarding
in less than 20 minutes.

659
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,083
Hurry up.

660
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,041
Gate two.

661
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,333
There are only two tickets left.

662
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,666
The third one needs to wait
for a passenger to cancel the flight.

663
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,916
You wait here.

664
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,958
Let's go.

665
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,083
Let's hurry and follow us.

666
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:33,750
Do you have more tickets?
Get me another one.

667
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,625
Your name is…

668
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,541
Santi Saelee.

669
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,541
Santi.

670
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Oh, come on. It was taken a long time ago.

671
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,833
Please wait for a moment.
I'll verify the information.

672
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,875
Are we good now?

673
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,750
Stop playing. We're leaving.

674
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,500
Hello, Ms. Wang.
I am Xiaoyu from SR EXPRESS.

675
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,416
Did you just finish a marathon?

676
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,958
- This is Santi, our CEO.
- Hello.

677
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,166
You are too late. I have to leave.

678
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,166
It only takes five minutes,
and we can start right now.

679
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,916
Can we go now, Aunt?

680
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,458
In a minute. Wait a moment.
You guys play for a while.

681
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,333
I'll open my phone
and there is a PPT file.

682
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:04,625
It doesn't matter.

683
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:05,625
The original intention
of our SR EXPRESS is…

684
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,625
No need to introduce.

685
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,708
I have already seen it.

686
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,750
The whole proposal seems quite convincing,

687
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,083
but it should be difficult for you
to catch up with EASY, right?

688
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,916
I asked you to come here today
to find out what is different about you.

689
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:40,833
- Oh…
- We will go directly

690
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,333
to the customer's door to make money.

691
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:51,083
Our selling point is door-to-door pickup
and no minimum consumption.

692
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,041
<i>No matter what the weather is,</i>

693
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,291
<i>we will serve them as usual.</i>

694
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:13,375
Our future customers.

695
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:20,791
No one has done
door-to-door service in Thailand?

696
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,916
Pick up door to door
even if there is only one item.

697
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,666
Others don't dare to do it.

698
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,708
It's going to cost lots of money,

699
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,041
but I like the idea.

700
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:47,666
What you need is $15 million
for 15% of the shares, right?

701
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,041
Right.

702
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,791
<i>on flight FB278 bound for Chiang Mai.</i>

703
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,291
We will fly to Chiang Mai
to continue our conversation.

704
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,833
No, I don't have time.

705
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:07,208
How about 15 million US dollars
for 30% of the shares?

706
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,708
Damn 30%! You're still so mean.
I just want to come in and see for myself.

707
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:15,083
Ruijie, what are you saying?

708
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,708
With such a small amount
of money, you expect to own a large stake.

709
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,208
When the company is a hit,
you'll just take it away.

710
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,958
Do you want to make money this way
for the rest of your life?

711
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,541
Listen, the hostile takeover
at your company happened

712
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,750
because you had no one
looking after your financials.

713
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,916
You're not alone this time. Trust me.

714
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,250
You know her nickname is Viper

715
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,041
and her reputation in this industry
is already bad,

716
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,041
but you still ask her for money.

717
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:30,166
- You are so disgusting.
- Enough.

718
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,250
If you have other options,
good luck to you,

719
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,583
but if you do,
you won't come here to find me.

720
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:45,125
- If you feel it's not okay, just leave.
- Wait a moment.

721
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,375
Hey, don't just care
about this little money.

722
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:50,791
Remember what you said,
"We can make tens of billions."

723
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:55,166
Thirty percent is a lot,
but we have no other choice.

724
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,916
We need this money.

725
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,625
it's time to make a decision.
