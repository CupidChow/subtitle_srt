1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:10,375
SIX MONTHS LATER

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,291
You do it.

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,500
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'll let you start it this time.

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,500
You wrote the code, so do it yourself.

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,500
Here we go then?

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,500
Are you waiting
for a ribbon cutting ceremony?

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,666
Hurry up, you snail!

8
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,166
<i>I wish you wealth</i>
<i>Thank you for helping out</i>

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,958
<i>I wish you luck and happiness</i>
<i>May you be blessed with prosperity</i>

10
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,375
CELEBRATING NATIONWIDE LAUNCH
IN ALL 76 PROVINCES!

11
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:50,958
Okay.

12
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:59,375
Today, I want to say that
we have branches in all 76 provinces,

13
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:03,500
which makes us now
a nationwide express business.

14
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,916
Drink to your heart's content.
Let's get wasted.

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,041
We also have a very special guest
from Khon Kaen…

16
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:24,791
Mr. Dech from Dashing Dech Express!

17
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,041
Music! Come on!

18
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,916
Come on. Come and drink with him
and his teammates.

19
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Are you worried about
the meeting this morning?

20
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,041
He controls the whole northeastern route.

21
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,000
If he doesn't buy in
on the wholesale payment plan,

22
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,666
we would be doomed.

23
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,125
First option, a fixed price sharing.

24
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,791
If you agree to distribute our parcels,

25
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,041
you will receive a flat rate
of 10,000 baht per tonne.

26
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,458
We guarantee a minimum
of 30 tonnes per week.

27
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,541
Or you might consider the second option,
a marginal profit sharing.

28
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,416
For the first 50 tonnes,
it'd be 15,000 baht per tonne.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,625
That's enough! Stop. Stop!

30
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,041
Options my ass! Let's go!

31
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,875
- Please listen to this option first.
- No!

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,833
Sir, do you want to race me?

33
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,083
What do I get out of it?

34
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm not doing this deal with you anyway.

35
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,041
I'll shave my head if I lose.

36
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:43,958
If I win, you'll stay
and have dinner with us tonight.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,125
<i>I was born in Isan</i>

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,375
<i>Rugged and looked down upon</i>

39
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,708
<i>Sadly left home</i>
<i>To find fortune in a stranger's land</i>

40
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,916
Go!

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,958
<i>Without a plow</i>

42
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,958
<i>I catch fish</i>

43
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,083
<i>Without a field</i>

44
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:16,875
<i>I live on a boat</i>

45
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,666
Lubricant here.

46
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,541
Thunder!

47
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,916
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,208
Linux!

49
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,708
<i>Mother, are you angry,</i>
<i>Or just raising me to be tough?</i>

50
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,291
- Armie!
- Shit. Seriously?!

51
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:45,458
<i>May I have those crabs and fish</i>
<i>As my wages?</i>

52
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,375
<i>The sea</i>

53
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:52,833
<i>Is like a tough person</i>
<i>That keeps fighting</i>

54
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:57,458
<i>The fish can be jealous</i>

55
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>When the waves come crashing</i>

56
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,333
For fuck's sake!

57
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,291
So much for a front-row ticket!

58
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,375
Are you drunk yet, sir?

59
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,375
Remember this…

60
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,500
No matter what deal we make,
in pieces or in bulk,

61
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,666
I'm going with you.

62
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
I want to be your friend.

63
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,166
Now that you see me, my employees,
and my company…

64
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,250
Do you think someone like me
can be your friend?

65
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:00,958
Listen to me.

66
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,750
I saw you and your people eating
at the same table.

67
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,208
Your subordinates
were joking around with you.

68
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,875
You treated them well.

69
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,708
I think you'll treat me well too.

70
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>To our nationwide delivery service</i>

71
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:25,458
<i>Thunder will now proceed</i>
<i>To deliver your parcel</i>

72
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,500
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

73
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,833
- Stop!
- Stop! Damn it!

74
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,166
Boy! Listen to me.

75
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,541
I'm Suradech Sridondaeng.

76
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,458
In the 30 years of shipping,

77
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,458
this is the first time that Dashing Dech

78
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,083
will agree to the fixed sharing option.

79
00:06:54,708 --> 00:07:00,416
I will only do it for Thunder.

80
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,541
One, two, one, two, three.

81
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,041
<i>Thunder, Thunder Express</i>
<i>Deliver quickly, deliver quickly</i>

82
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,166
<i>Thunder Express</i>

83
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,958
<i>Thunder, Thunder Express, near or far…</i>

84
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:27,333
Linux, walk slowly.
Be careful of the stairs.

85
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,083
Ugh!

86
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:52,083
Is this from your car?

87
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,166
Mm.

88
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,833
Why are you keeping it here?

89
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:03,458
For memory. If one day you're gone,
I don't want your writing to fade away.

90
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,833
I'll rewrite it with
a permanent marker then.

91
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,291
Sure.

92
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,000
So, did you take it out by yourself?

93
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,000
No. I let the expert handle it.

94
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,458
- Here?
- Alright.

95
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,625
Sign your name for me too.

96
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,708
So, I've calculated.

97
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,416
With our growth rate, I may be able to…

98
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,208
exit the company sooner than expected.
Maybe in less than a year.

99
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,916
When that day comes, I'll throw
a huge banquet all over the parking lot.

100
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,041
Are you that happy?

101
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,791
It's not to celebrate you leaving.
It's a party to console myself.

102
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,958
What?

103
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,708
You can laugh no matter how sad I am?

104
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,416
You're so mean.

105
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,750
I'll add tears for you then.

106
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,333
What are you drawing?

107
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,750
- Are you drunk?
- Yes.

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,041
But… not drunk enough to forget
that you have to go back and get married.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,291
I'm trying to imagine…

110
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,166
what your wedding would look like.

111
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,583
What kind of venue?
How many guests will be attending?

112
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,083
What kind of dress you will be wearing?

113
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,083
I know for sure
you will be wearing red lipstick.

114
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,000
And your opera singer friend
will sing his heart out.

115
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,291
Wow.

116
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:38,666
Hey. My father would be shocked
to the core if he saw that vomit. You see?

117
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,875
It's all over Bom's face.

118
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,708
I felt so bad for him.

119
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,458
If the wedding is held in an open field,
there's got to be a BBQ.

120
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,208
When it's over, a mobile band
will take the stage for everyone to dance.

121
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,458
And the souvenirs
would be classic green inhalers.

122
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,583
Sounds good?

123
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,666
But I don't think my fiancé
will be into any of that.

124
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,291
Do you guys get along well?

125
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

126
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,583
We have the same dream.

127
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,625
What dream?

128
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:38,583
We both dream to have a child.
We are so sick of working our asses off.

129
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,083
We want to have a small house

130
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,416
and watch someone grow.

131
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,083
That would be the real happiness.

132
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,125
But when we created our own company,

133
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,583
it really is like having a child.

134
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,250
An overeating, fast-growing child.

135
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,750
But I don't if I'll be okay

136
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,875
when I have to leave this place.

137
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,666
If I let you take care of our child,
it's going to be spoiled.

138
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,833
Look at you.

139
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,083
Do you want to watch
our child grow up together?

140
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,916
Of course.

141
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,708
Then…

142
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,583
Linux, are you okay?
You're throwing up again.

143
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,333
Can you get her some water?

144
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,541
I'll leave her to you.

145
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,750
I don't feel so good. I have to go.

146
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,125
What did you send me?

147
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,708
<i>Give you a surprise.</i>

148
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,208
A massager.

149
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:17,333
<i>Today, Lao Li said he bought</i>
<i>a massager for his girlfriend,</i>

150
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,333
<i>so she doesn't have to go</i>
<i>to the massage parlor anymore.</i>

151
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,458
Really? So cool?

152
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,833
<i>You press the first button.</i>

153
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,958
<i>Long press.</i>

154
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,125
Long press.

155
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,125
- Okay. What is…
- <i>How about it? Enjoy it.</i>

156
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
<i>It's quite good.</i>
<i>You use the computer a lot,</i>

157
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>so I'm worried that your neck</i>
<i>might be too sore,</i>

158
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,625
<i>thus you might have a headache.</i>

159
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,708
Not bad.

160
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,041
<i>Stop moaning like that, okay?</i>

161
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,333
Get your mind out of the gutter.

162
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,291
<i>What gutter? Can you come back now?</i>

163
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:01,291
<i>Okay? Now. Come back now!</i>

164
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,375
I miss you too.

165
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,333
Are you available this month?

166
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,750
Do you want to come here?

167
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:40,625
KEEP FIGHTING!

168
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,875
Hey, Ken!

169
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,875
You are still so handsome.
Long time no see.

170
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,250
I haven't seen you in a while.
You're still handsome.

171
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,125
Oh, thank you. Hello.

172
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,458
This is the newly launched
EASY Home campaign.

173
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,916
It was a big success.

174
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,083
Not as handsome as you.

175
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,041
Not as handsome as you.

176
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,583
Oh, wow. Thank you.

177
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:18,041
In our office, departments like finance,
admin, sales,

178
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,000
and marketing department
will be on this floor.

179
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,291
BD and other development teams
are upstairs.

180
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:30,125
This is 1970 Hanakase Daikinjo vintage.

181
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,958
I have been saving it for this.

182
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,333
This is an old Japanese wine from 1970.

183
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,750
I prepared it especially to welcome you.

184
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,250
Rare and good wine.

185
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,833
It is hard
to find this kind of wine in China.

186
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,166
This is good liquor.
It's hard to find this in China.

187
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,916
Here it is.

188
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,375
Cheers.

189
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,000
Good wine!

190
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,208
This is a good wine.

191
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,583
This bottle of good wine is worth it
if used to celebrate.

192
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:23,208
But it's useless
if you use it to cover up something.

193
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,041
Don't you remember?

194
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,166
Do you remember that you promised me
that within half a year,

195
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,416
you would make the company's market share
number one in the industry?

196
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,000
But now FINIX is taking
a lot of our market share.

197
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,916
Can you explain this?

198
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,958
Um…

199
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,291
We are in the process of putting out
a more aggressive, forward service.

200
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,333
Last month, we launched
the EASY Home campaign,

201
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,791
which has been very successful so far.

202
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,833
This month, we have launched
an EASY home campaign,

203
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,291
which was very successful.

204
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,250
Ah.

205
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,416
Copy Thunder's campaign?

206
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,208
You mean the campaign
that you copied from Thunder?

207
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,291
There is an old Chinese saying,

208
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,875
"Wealth does not last
for more than three generations."

209
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,041
We are the first generation, brother.

210
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:31,458
I want to hear your answer
to this question.

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,750
We made a mistake by letting Thunder
take our market shares.

212
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,375
If we can crush them,
we will surely catch up with FINIX.

213
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,208
Hold it up.

214
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,250
Put it down.

215
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,166
Your father spent a lot of time
persuading me

216
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,625
to make you the CEO.

217
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
Don't disappoint me any further.

218
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,333
There's a coffee stain on your tie.
Didn't your dad tell you?

219
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,291
I have to go.

220
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,375
The branches
in the universities are confirmed.

221
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,458
Right now, we have Hatyai,
Chiang Mai, Khon Kaen.

222
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,000
We are working on the rest.

223
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,958
Mr. San.

224
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,208
Mr. San.

225
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,791
Oh, okay. Good job.

226
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,375
Make sure you get Ubon Ratchathani
and Songkhla on board as well, and…

227
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,166
Come with me, asshole.
You need to clear this up with Xiaoyu now.

228
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,333
Come here!

229
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,416
What the fuck?

230
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,875
Alright, here he is. Talk.

231
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,458
- Talk about what?
- She wouldn't approve the budget!

232
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,208
Does she think the app
can handle unlimited users?

233
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,000
If you want to expand nationwide,
the server is going to be overloaded!

234
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,000
The more people on it,
the slower the app will become.

235
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,000
The worst is that the app will crash.
Do you want it to crash first?

236
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,375
Are you all dumb?
I need money to buy a server.

237
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,125
No users have reported any lag issues yet.

238
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,833
It's okay to buy next quarter.

239
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,875
Hey, you should change your title
to the company's brake pad.

240
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,083
Wanna drive without brakes?
Go ahead and skid off the curve!

241
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,791
- What did you say?
- Enough.

242
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,583
Uh…

243
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,416
So, have we used up
the tech team's budget for this batch?

244
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,625
No. I just want to save it.

245
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,208
So we have some to allocate to other
departments in case of emergency.

246
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,458
I think… Uh…

247
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,916
Why the fuck are you stuttering?

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
Get her to approve the budget

249
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
or I'm going to sell
your semi trucks for it!

250
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,041
Waste of my day.

251
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,333
Hey. After the sales meeting,
wanna grab dinner or something?

252
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,625
I know a place near the Chao Phraya River.

253
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,541
No, I have some work to finish.

254
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,541
No worries. I can wait.

255
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,625
I was drunk yesterday.

256
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
Let's just be copartners.

257
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,500
Is that how you really feel about me?

258
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,541
This is a big deal, Mr. San.

259
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,166
You understand us?

260
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,958
No, I didn't get any of it.

261
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:51,000
But there's something big happening
at the Pratunam branch!

262
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,458
People are all in chaos.
We're screwed, boss.

263
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,375
Hey, what are you doing?!
Why are you shutting us down?

264
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,625
Man. What the hell?

265
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,291
You guys are breaking our regulations.

266
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,166
Your vinyl is not in an approved zone.

267
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,750
See? It's ten centimeters longer.

268
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,000
Are you guys trying to be funny?

269
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,666
It's not funny.
It's the rules of the market.

270
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,500
PICK UP PACKAGES FROM YOUR DOOR
25 BAHT FEE NATIONWIDE

271
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,708
Mr. Chai. What the hell is this?

272
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,833
Calm down, Santi. Let's talk about this.

273
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:36,083
EASILY CHANGE
YOUR HOME INTO PACKAGE PICK-UP POINT

274
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:37,750
Oh!

275
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,708
Is it because of these fuck faces?!

276
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,083
How much did they pay you?!

277
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,250
You know I'm on your side.

278
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,500
But If I don't push you out,

279
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,875
Kanin Group is going to cancel
their contracts with all of my properties.

280
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,500
EASY HOME PICK-UP POINT

281
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,791
Armie, I need a vinyl sign printed.

282
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,833
I will open a new branch!

283
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,625
Thunder's new price!
Starting at just 19 baht!

284
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:52,416
Come on in, everyone!
Ninenteen baht only!

285
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,875
Please wait, ma'am.

286
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,208
I come first!

287
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,750
KANIN

288
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,000
- Hey!
- Don't push!

289
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,333
Go wait outside.

290
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,125
You're afraid I'll have you killed
or something?

291
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,041
Don't worry. There is no bounty
on your head.

292
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,458
Not even after my 19-baht campaign?

293
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,125
Hey.

294
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:53,000
On the first day, I delivered almost
8,000 packages just from one branch.

295
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:57,916
Your son's EASY Home
has five pick-up points

296
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,375
but can't even reach 3,000 parcels.

297
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,541
You're still wearing that?

298
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:10,208
You can throw it away if you want.
It's nothing to me.

299
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:16,083
I told myself that the day
I get to step over you,

300
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,041
I'll throw this damn watch away.

301
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:22,000
The most expensive lesson of my life.

302
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,041
Has anyone around you

303
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:32,000
ever warned you?
When you want to do something,

304
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,833
you are reckless.

305
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,041
I invited you here today

306
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,041
because I wanted to warn you.

307
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,083
Do not start a price war.

308
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,958
If everyone cuts prices,
the market is going to collapse.

309
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:58,583
With your connections,
you will be the first to go.

310
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:08,750
I'm worried about you. I don't want it
to be the last lesson in your life.

311
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,041
Shipping nationwide for only 19 baht.

312
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,000
You'll see.

313
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,375
What the hell are you doing?

314
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,458
Good timing.

315
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,166
Can you have a look if this is okay?
Armie, stretch it out.

316
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,916
STARTS AT 19 BAHT NATIONWIDE

317
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,833
How could you reduce
the price to 19 baht nationwide?

318
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,250
Why did you not talk to me first?

319
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:59,833
Is this because of the meeting
you had with Kanin?

320
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,958
Can you all leave us for a minute?
We need to talk alone.

321
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,416
Did Thong let it slip?

322
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,000
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

323
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,833
We can't ever bring the price
back up again now.

324
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,083
If EASY cut their price
to even one baht lower than ours,

325
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,166
we're dead in the water!

326
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,666
I'm sure they won't do it.

327
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,333
You were there at EASY.
You know their deal with the Chinese.

328
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:39,916
With the 25 baht fee,
we will survive for one year.

329
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,041
If it's 19 baht,

330
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,375
how many months
do you think we will survive?

331
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,166
Answer me. How many months?

332
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:53,916
Ten years,
because we are going to beat them all!

333
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,125
Yeah. We'll beat them all in sales!

334
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,708
But there will be no profit margin left.

335
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,500
We won't survive
for more than four months!

336
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,625
Use your brain. Four months.

337
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,208
How are we going to find funding?
Which Idiot is going to invest in us?!

338
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,458
Within four months, the investors
will be lining up to invest in us.

339
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,541
I'm sure.

340
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,166
Forget about the two-year plan
to return our investment.

341
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,583
I understand.

342
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,000
You're just worried about
your wedding plan, right?

343
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,583
So you don't want to do it.

344
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,166
Yes,

345
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,750
I want to go back and get married.

346
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,125
But whatever I want to do
is none of your business.

347
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,291
Right?

348
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,041
You're dragging everyone down with you.

349
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,208
I just needed to warn you,
as your colleague. That's it.

350
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,958
This is our golden chance.

351
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,500
We are doing this.
This is my final decision.

352
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,500
I can't just let this company have
a living breath for only four more months.

353
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,291
If you are really going to do this,

354
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,708
something's got to give.

355
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,750
Tell me what I have to do.

356
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,416
We have to cut everyone's pay.

357
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,375
No! You can lower my pay if you need to,

358
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,000
but don't fucking do it to my team!

359
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,750
Even if we lower all of ours,
we still have to lower their pay.

360
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,833
We pay much higher salaries, overtime,
and benefits than all our competitors.

361
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:48,041
This is the only way to keep us
from sinking.

362
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,166
Is this the only solution?
Are you out of your mind?

363
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,750
What kind of CFO are you?

364
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,583
Do you think I want to do this?
We really have no other choice.

365
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,208
Shut the fuck up!

366
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,125
Enough!

367
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,958
From tomorrow onwards,
we are cutting down on all expenses.

368
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:04,166
Lower the benefits. No OTs.
Anything that can be sparred will be cut.

369
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,125
I am not getting paid a single baht

370
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,166
until I can find more investors.

371
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,416
That's it.

372
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,791
What are you still doing here?
Get out of here! Get out!

373
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,000
You guys! Get to work!

374
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,375
HOTEL

00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,125

"BREAKING NEWS!

00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:12,375

Is your brother actually doing this?

384
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,916
Did you know?

385
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,208
"ANNOUNCEMENT:
SALARY REDUCTION FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS"

386
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,416
Thong is not in trouble.

387
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,375
It's his family business.

388
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,958
Hey. Maybe San has a reason for it.

389
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,541
Cut him some slack.

390
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,416
What are you worried about?

391
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,208
All of them are working hard.
You hear it, right?

392
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,416
It's been just a week.
The sales have already doubled.

393
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,250
They just need to hold on
for a little while.

394
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:38,583
People won't be happy when payday comes.

395
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,666
Well, let's go check out the Ratchada
and Pratunam branches this evening.

396
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,875
If you see the line outside,
you won't be worried anymore.

397
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,083
I'm busy.

398
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,791
Come on. After that, I'll treat you
to dinner and then take you home.

399
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:49,875
I said I'm busy.

400
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,083
You're not. I checked your schedule.

401
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,958
Liam is coming today.

402
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm taking him to dinner, okay?

403
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,333
So, can I come with you?

404
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,291
Don't you think
I should get to know your boyfriend?

405
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,416
What for?

406
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,583
You ran away from him
and opened a company here.

407
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:19,125
Won't you let him meet your partner?

408
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,458
- Are you hungry?
- I'm hungry.

409
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:38,875
This way. Welcome, Mr. Liam.

410
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,041
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,250
Santi, the man who stole my fiancée,

412
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,666
we finally meet.

413
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,791
Nice to meet you.

414
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,875
What is all this?

415
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
These are gifts to thank you
for letting me "steal" Xiaoyu.

416
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,708
They are all good things.

417
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:02,208
Let me see. Thai red wine.

418
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,000
What is this?

419
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,916
Don't you like pandas? This is bamboo.

420
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,250
It's bamboo. I just…

421
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,041
Are you really going to bite it?

422
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,500
There is sticky rice inside.

423
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,375
Thank you.

424
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:26,125
In the company, she always frowns.

425
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,125
It's quite novel to see her laugh.

426
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,416
Really?

427
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,708
She's in a good mood today, right?

428
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,083
I think if I can win the domestic market,

429
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:48,750
I will expand to the neighboring countries
like Laos or the Philippines.

430
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,250
Actually, your idea is quite good

431
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,291
if you have enough funds.

432
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,541
After all, the market size
in Thailand is not big.

433
00:35:57,125 --> 00:36:00,083
Funding? Funding is not difficult to find.

434
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,833
Many people want to invest in us.

435
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,666
We only have one investor.
Why are you bragging?

436
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,666
So that Liam doesn't have to worry.

437
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,083
You are talking a lot.
This is why I didn't want you here.

438
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,541
Translator, can you translate it for me?

439
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,291
Nothing. Just some official stuff.
Nothing important.

440
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:25,083
I told Xiaoyu that it would be a pity
if she only stayed for two years.

441
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,416
Xiaoyu is now like a female general.

442
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:33,666
I sincerely hope
she can continue to work here.

443
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:48,166
Why don't you give me
some shares of the company?

444
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,750
Uh… Liam is kidding.

445
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,958
Just follow the market value,
500 million baht.

446
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,208
Ten percent is enough.

447
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,708
No kidding.

448
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,416
I'm serious.

449
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,833
It doesn't matter,
but you may have to wait.

450
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,291
Many people are lining up to invest now.

451
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,666
I also have my own principles.
First come, first served.

452
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,750
First come, first served.

453
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,375
I like this principle, too.

454
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:45,750
By the way, Santi was a tour guide.

455
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,833
Where do you want to go? To the beach?

456
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:51,333
Do you know why Xiaoyu
went to work in your company?

457
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:53,875
Liam, what are you talking about?

458
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,666
Actually, your company
does have potential,

459
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,583
but it is indeed short of funds.

460
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,583
However, you have been engaging in price
wars and costing large amounts of money.

461
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,833
I am afraid that Xiaoyu will not be able
to exit as planned within two years.

462
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,333
Liam, that's enough. I'm going back.

463
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,875
Yes, it's time to go home.

464
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,291
It's time to go back to our home.

465
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:26,166
This is also Xiaoyu's home.

466
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,916
I also believe that
she can lead Thunder to success.

467
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:38,791
You have to believe in Xiaoyu
and believe that she can do it.

468
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,833
If you don't believe it,
you will definitely not see it.

469
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,166
It's not that I don't trust Xiaoyu.

470
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,625
It's that I can't see how
your company can survive,

471
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,125
and Xiaoyu can't see it either.

472
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,208
But what I don't understand now is why
you want to keep wasting time with him?

473
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,208
Can't we talk nicely?

474
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,333
I don't want to talk too much.

475
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:30,541
Liam, what… What are you going to do?

476
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,458
Where are you going?

477
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,666
So, what do you want to tell me?

478
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,375
Do you want to tell me
that their company has potential?

479
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,875
Is it worth your continued persistence?

480
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:46,541
Looking at the financial statements,
how can this company survive?

481
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,583
What are you insisting on, Xiaoyu?

482
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,208
I can't abandon these employees now.

483
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,833
Can you understand my position?

484
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:03,041
Liam, please, can you not do this?

485
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,625
If I hadn't met Santi today,

486
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,708
I might have thought
you had some feelings for him.

487
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,416
What feelings?

488
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,166
What are you talking about?

489
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,208
Liam, this is too much.

490
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:25,291
You know I won't involve marriage
in the company's decision-making.

491
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,208
You also know I can't do that.

492
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,958
I've always known this,

493
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,291
but sometimes I really feel strange,
that is…

494
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,958
I don't know
whether you have me in your heart

495
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,500
every time you make a decision.

496
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,750
Liam.

497
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,000
Do you still remember our agreement?

498
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,416
Of course, I remember. How could I forget?

499
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:16,458
Can you understand me?
Can you wait for me?

500
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:27,000
I really don't know
why I should keep waiting.

501
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,166
Why do you say that?

502
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,416
Liam.

503
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,750
THE FILE YOU REQUESTED
I'VE SENT IT VIA EMAIL

504
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,750
MISSED CALL

505
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,541
Shitty company! Rider! Rider! Rider!

506
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,208
Rider! Rider! Rider!

507
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,000
We work our asses off,
but we get less pay.

508
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,708
What do they think we are?!

509
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,000
- Ri!
- Der!

510
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,666
We were riding through the rain
and in the heat.

511
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,750
We can't take it anymore!

512
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:05,000
- Calm down! Listen to me!
- Rider! Rider! Rider!

513
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:10,958
Rider! Rider! Rider!

514
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:13,583
Listen to me first!

515
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,625
I know I lowered your pay,

516
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:16,958
but we're now paying flexible rates

517
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,166
according
to your delivery distance instead.

518
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,875
This way,
it's fair to the work you guys do.

519
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,333
You work more, you get paid more.
You work less, you get less.

520
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,708
And when the fuck did we ever work less?

521
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,541
Hey, I understand all of you.

522
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:32,750
But I beg you to believe me
and be patient.

523
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,625
And how the fuck
am I going to feed my family?

524
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,125
Yeah!

525
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,291
Why is the rider tracking system
so damn slow?

526
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,750
What the fuck is happening?
Who is in charge of optimization?

527
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,333
Um, that would be Nun.

528
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:55,250
And where the hell is he? Nun!

529
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,750
He quit this morning.

530
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,750
Then you, Arm. Continue his work.

531
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,500
Use batch requests.

532
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,708
Ruijie. Our team has been working
tirelessly without sleep.

533
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,125
We couldn't even go home.

534
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:20,250
And about the pay cut,
aren't you gonna fight for us at all?

535
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,583
That's right.
I have to take care of my family.

536
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:28,708
With lowered pay and no OTs,
I'm really not sure if I can continue.

537
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,250
If you can't, then quit
and let your mom take care of you.

538
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,833
Whining pieces of shit. I'll do it myself!

539
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:43,916
Whining? The hell?
I can't take this anymore.

540
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,500
Calm down, Arm.

541
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:50,000
You guys can stay if you want.
I can't with that asshole boss.

542
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,416
Get off of me.

543
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,000
My app has detected 40 cheating assholes.

544
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,708
They're faking package weights,

545
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,041
inflating petrol receipts,
and scamming our clients.

546
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,208
Yeah. I'll take care of this.

547
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,083
Your friend is one of them.

548
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,541
I just lost two of my team members.

549
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:46,416
Now it's your turn, asshole.
Don't be a wuss!

550
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,666
I'm sorry, man.
Don't make it a big deal.

551
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,958
What you did is a fucking fraud.

552
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,375
Shit, I'm saying sorry now.

553
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,958
It's just a little bit.

554
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,875
You are firing me like this?

555
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:07,333
Hey! What about my mom and my son?
How am I supposed to take care of them?

556
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,625
What the fuck?
Look at your brother, Thong!

557
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,541
When you needed help, I didn't even
hesitate to come down and help!

558
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,458
When you don't need me anymore,

559
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,583
you are just going
to throw me away like this?

560
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:18,291
Hey. Don't you understand?

561
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,041
If you're off the hook, then what
do I say to the thousands of cheaters?

562
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,708
"Oh, sorry. Only my friends
can fuck me over." Like that?

563
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:27,000
I know I made mistakes.

564
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:30,333
You're the CEO. I know that you
have to do what you have to do.

565
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,583
You can call me a dickhead.

566
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,333
You can curse my parents if you want.

567
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,458
Please let me keep my job.
I can't lose this job.

568
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,791
Boy is still young.

569
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:47,833
I want my child to grow up to be like you.

570
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,083
Take your mom and Boy back home.

571
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,625
I'll pay for the trip back.

572
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,375
Thanks, my friend.

573
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,041
I'm so thankful…

574
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,416
- Bullshit! You asshole!
- Bom!

575
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,041
Are you fucking crazy?!

576
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,416
This is what you do
to your lifelong friend?!

577
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:21,291
Is this what you do to your friend?
Is it because of money?

578
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:24,666
If money is a huge problem, then take it.

579
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,583
I won't take any of your money.
We're done.

580
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,500
Let's see how long will
this fucking company of yours survive.

581
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:36,333
Fuck! Motherfucker!

582
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:37,875
Bom.

583
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,291
Fucking bullshit!

584
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,833
Mr. Santi,

585
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,250
EASY just launched a new campaign today.

586
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,083
There are ads across every channel.

587
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:06,833
EASY Care parcel insurance?

588
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,916
PARCEL INSURANCE
FREE UP TO 2,000 BAHT

589
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,166
Armie, what's our outgoing number today?

590
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,875
From the morning cut-off,
our numbers are down 20%.

591
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,208
How could this be?
Just because of a shipping insurance ploy?

592
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,000
I think it is because
of this clip, Mr. San.

593
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,458
Someone recorded us
burning fake parcels and leaked it.

594
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,208
Right now, the clip has 20,000 shares
and two million views.

595
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,166
The hashtag is trending
at over 100,000 now.

596
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,666
You don't even have to guess
who leaked it.

597
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:40,708
They set it up like a volleyball game.

598
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:44,250
<i>Parcel insurance from EASY!</i>

599
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,125
<i>Free maximum coverage of 2,000 baht.</i>

600
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,250
Damn. It's all in their plan.

601
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,666
<i>Safe deliver, ship with</i>

602
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:55,583
- They came all the way to insult us.
- <i>EASY, EASY, EASY!</i>

603
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:02,291
<i>Our EASY Home volume</i>
<i>is now up by 14%, Mr. Ken.</i>

604
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:05,000
Okay, tomorrow, I want a full report.

605
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,666
- <i>Sure, Mr. Ken.</i>
- Thank you.

606
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,500
A blanket that's not too warm,

607
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,750
- just like half-closed eyes…
- Dad.

608
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,791
Your favorite mountain boy
is probably freaking out right now.

609
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,916
I'm impressed.

610
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,625
How did you get him
to lower his price to 19 baht?

611
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:26,041
Santi only believes in himself.

612
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,125
I just had to make him believe
that he is making the right decision.

613
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:38,833
It's like luring the crabs
into the boiling pot. Easy.

614
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,791
Have you talked to FINIX?

615
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:45,833
I have. I told them not to drop
their price to match Thunder.

616
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,541
They are going to wither
and die alone within three months.

617
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:53,333
They were already dead the day
they decided to jump into this arena.

618
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,208
The ocean.

619
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:00,166
My grandson is so smart.

620
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:05,875
The other day, there was
a video clip released on social media.

621
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:10,708
It caused a lot of damage to our company.
So, I'll give you a tour of our warehouse

622
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:13,875
to see how we work. Take a look.

623
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:19,541
I'd like you to see for yourselves how
carefully Thunder Express handles parcels.

624
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,333
Who would want to throw
a customer's parcel for fun, right?

625
00:50:22,416 --> 00:50:25,041
Mr. Santi, how can we know for sure

626
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,416
that what you're showing us
is not staged just for today?

627
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,791
How can we possibly stage it?

628
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,458
We do this normally.

629
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,416
But in the clip,
we saw you burning the packages yourself.

630
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,041
What you see in the clip happened

631
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,958
when we were dealing
with an unclaimed package.

632
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,583
Why did you not just simply
return them to the senders?

633
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,250
Why did you need to burn them?

634
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,041
The customer paid for the service.

635
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,083
They wanted the packages
to reach the destinations.

636
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,625
But look at what you did.

637
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,000
Oh, <i>Bangkok Daily</i>?

638
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:58,458
What, Mr. Santi? Mr. Santi?

639
00:50:58,541 --> 00:50:59,708
- Santi.
- Give us an explanation.

640
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,458
- Give us an explanation.
- You explain this badge.

641
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,125
Did that damn Kanin send you here?
Tell me.

642
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:04,833
This is my reporter badge, Mr. Santi.

643
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:07,083
Capture this.
Everyone, please record this.

644
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,333
Give us an explanation.

645
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,083
- I want an explanation.
- Everyone, let's go look at the warehouse.

646
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,416
Give us an explanation.

647
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,083
Are you a violent person, Mr. Santi?

648
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,041
- Why don't you answer me?
- What?

649
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,500
- You need to explain.
- Excuse me.

650
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:41,458
Use your brain, not your emotions.

651
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:58,416
I… I should have listened
to you about the 19 baht price.

652
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,875
I fell into his trap and played his game.

653
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,833
I'm so stupid.

654
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,875
The more you keep Kanin in your head,
the more foolish you become.

655
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:25,875
Hey.

656
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:32,041
Everybody…

657
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,333
…believed in me,

658
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,958
but all I did was drag them down with me.

659
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:44,291
Me.

660
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:47,458
I am done.

661
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,583
Don't you dare fucking say you are done!

662
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:59,291
I know the burden you carry is heavy…
And I can't help you carry it.

663
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,125
But you need to be the last one standing.

664
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,625
Because if you are done,
all of us will have nothing left.

665
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:18,083
Or we'll have only
that side mirror left as a relic.

666
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:31,875
You said it yourself.

667
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:36,458
If you don't give up, you never lose.

668
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,708
Get the fuck up.

669
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,875
Thousands of your people
are waiting for you.

670
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,375
Can you not go back and get married?

671
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,791
I really can't lose you.

672
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,708
I have to go home now.

673
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:28,791
Liam is waiting.

674
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,083
It's late.

675
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,625
Let's go back.

676
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,791
Should I drive you home?

677
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,833
It's okay. I can drive.

678
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,250
YOUR LIFE IS WORTH ONLY THIS ONE BULLET.
