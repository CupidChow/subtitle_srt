VALUED AT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,916
THIS STORY IS BASED

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,916
ON THAILAND'S FIRST UNICORN STARTUP

00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,708
<i>Do you know</i>

8
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:48,125
<i>…even though everyone says</i>
<i>that it's a giant's field?</i>

9
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,875
<i>I jumped into this for only one reason.</i>

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,208
<i>Revenge.</i>

MAD UNICORN

00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:20,750
WANG NUEA SAND MINE, LAMPANG, 2015

13
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,833
Santi! Santi! The boss wants you!

14
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:42,750
What?

15
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,000
The boss needs to talk to you!

16
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,416
Yeah, I'll be there.

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,166
<i>Sir, we're selling 300 baht per lot here.</i>

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,500
<i>My boss won't be okay with just 200.</i>

19
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:12,583
Tell him he's doing business
with Kanin Group.

20
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,833
Have you heard of it?

21
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,791
The higher-ups are pressuring me too.
So, this is the best I can offer

22
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,000
What did he say?

23
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,791
He said that he was also forced
by Kanin Group.

24
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,041
Fuck!

25
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,833
I don't care who made him do it.

26
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,875
He doesn't even have
the most basic respect.

27
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,416
People should not be too greedy.

28
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,833
Fuck you.

29
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,458
Think about it.

30
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,375
Given our size,

31
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,458
we'll have demand year-round,
and you could make millions from us.

32
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,875
Does the Chinese have a saying similar
to "half a loaf is better than none"?

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,833
- Boss, I think if we can reduce--
- I won't reduce a penny.

34
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,500
Suit yourself, then.

35
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,583
Your machines are worn out,
and you have to support these workers.

36
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,583
The costs are piling up.
How long can he keep it going?

37
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,708
You go back to work.

38
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,708
Boss, if you don't want to sell it,
what should we do then?

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,125
Anyway, this mine is like a dying horse,

40
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,458
so let it die in my hands.

41
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,958
It's better than selling it cheaply
to these money-grubbers.

42
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,750
If he succeeds this time,

43
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,375
he will continue to exploit others.

44
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,500
That's 130 baht. Thank you very much.

45
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,416
Aunty, are my cookies still here?

46
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,333
Took you long enough. It's 250 baht.

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,375
Thank you, Aunty.

48
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,500
I thought you weren't going
to keep it for me.

49
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,750
One more thing, Aunty.
Can I get one of those bows for free?

50
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,791
MRS. YUPHIN SAELEE

51
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,375
I’m done writing. What's next?

52
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,250
Sixty baht.

53
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,916
What? The box is tiny.
Why is it so expensive?

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The fee is calculated by weight.

55
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:12,583
Then I'll just send these. How much is it?
It's a Christmas gift for my mom.

56
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,500
It’s 50 baht.

57
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,666
How about this? I only have 30 baht.

58
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,000
Look. Even if you send an empty box,
it'll be 50 baht.

59
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,000
It's our starting price.

60
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,791
Save up and send it all to your mom
during the New Year.

PATHS TO THE TOP IN THE BUSINESS WORLD

63
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>Before I got to this point,</i>
<i>do you know what I've been doing?</i>

64
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,666
I quit my job at 25.

65
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,625
I did that to start Thailand's
first business newspaper.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,791
Then I got into the cement business,
real estate, and hotels.

67
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,000
I like to be the first in line.

68
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,041
PATHS TO THE TOP IN THE BUSINESS WORLD

69
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,458
That's why,
when I see any business opportunity,

70
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,291
I make sure to be the first to do it.

71
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,916
Because problems are where the money is.

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,833
Sir.

73
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,541
What is it?

74
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:22,166
I don't have any money.
How can I be the first like you?

75
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,125
The money is in the air.

76
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,750
It’s a matter of seeing it or not.

77
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,666
If you want my money, you must think about

78
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,000
what you have that I don't.

79
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,333
I have debt, sir.

80
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:45,166
I bet I have more debt
than all of you put together.

81
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,375
Anyone else?

82
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,250
- A student ID card.
- Hmm.

83
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:50,916
Yes.

84
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,791
But why would I need it? I didn't want it.

85
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,916
Think about what I need.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,416
Think. Think.

87
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,791
Know your customer.

88
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,583
A chair!

89
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,833
You've been standing there for a while,
and your legs must be tired.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,208
Now you're the first in line.
How much would you sell it to me?

91
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,583
Ten thousand baht.

92
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,750
If that's your price,
I think I'll buy from someone else.

93
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,375
Are there any other offers? Anyone?

94
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,958
I'd sell it for 8,500 baht.

95
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,416
There you go. Anyone else?

96
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,458
- Five thousand.
- In the back. How much?

97
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,458
I'd sell it for only a thousand baht,
with two more for free.

98
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,791
Do you see
what the market is really like now?

99
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,375
Everyone tries to sell it.

100
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,416
The price goes down.

101
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,291
What's next?

102
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,458
But if I own all the chairs,

103
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,375
you'll have to pay whatever price I set.

104
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,500
Right?

105
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,750
Hmm.

106
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,583
What's your name?

107
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,708
Santi.

108
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,500
What's your major?

109
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,458
I major in sand mining.

110
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,833
Tell those guys
to close the valve immediately.

111
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,208
Boss.

112
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:35,083
Boss, you said
this mine is a dying horse, right?

113
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,458
I have an idea to save it.

114
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,750
Fuck.

115
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,750
What idea?

116
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,916
You have to make a promise first.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,333
If I make it, you'll give me some money.

118
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,041
Tell me the details.

119
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:05,166
WANG NUEA SAND MINE

120
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,875
We used to sell it for 300 baht per lot,

121
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,583
but now the boss
wants to sell it to you for 400.

122
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,250
Is this how you're going to do it?

123
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,458
Hey, they all charged me
200 baht around here.

124
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,375
All the mines around here

125
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,666
have signed a wholesale contract
with my boss for the next three months.

126
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,500
Your boss must be swimming in money
to be buying all this sand for nothing.

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,208
I can just transport it
from Pa Sang, Lamphun.

128
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,000
Cross-province transport?

129
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,333
There are costs for ten-wheelers, fuel,
licenses, and all the bribery.

130
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,500
Buying it from me at 400 a lot
is still cheaper, right?

131
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,125
I saw that you had all the rocks ready
at your site the other day.

132
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,250
If you don't have any sand
to start working with,

133
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,083
the workers will just get paid to chill.

134
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,666
Three-fifty. Deal?

135
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,541
Four hundred. Final offer.

136
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,166
This is 50,000 Thai baht.

137
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,541
You will be the manager
of the mine tomorrow.

138
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,958
I will give you 50,000 a month.

139
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,250
How is it? Does it smell good?

140

Or do you want sand?
Take as much as you want.

143
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,125
Boss.

144
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,041
Hmm?

145
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,666
Can you give me a lump sum of money?

146
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,875
I want to start a business.

147
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,250
What kind of business?

148
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,541
Any business that can make a lot of money.

149
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,000
Young people nowadays have a big appetite.

150
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:47,791

00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,375

<i>not even shoes to wear.</i>

162
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,833
<i>When I was hungry,</i>
<i>I had to go to the forest to shoot birds.</i>

163
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,958
<i>If we didn't catch enough birds,</i>

164
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,125
<i>my mother would have to endure hunger</i>
<i>and let my brother and I eat.</i>

165
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,375
<i>The only chance to eat good food</i>
<i>was at Christmas.</i>

166
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,500
<i>People in the city would bring food</i>
<i>to the church for distribution.</i>

167
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,791
<i>When I was a child,</i>
<i>I was happy just to get anything.</i>

168
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,000
<i>When I grew up,</i>

169
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:41,208
<i>I realized that the donated food</i>
<i>was actually what others didn't want.</i>

170
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,166
<i>It pissed me off.</i>

171
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,416
Why was I born poor?

172
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,000
I just want to make a lot of money.

173
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,291
How much do you want?

174
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,083

00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,000
Santi, let me tell you,

178
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,958
plucking bird feathers

179
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,833
takes the same amount of time
as plucking chicken feathers,

180
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,500
but chickens have more meat.

181
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,875
You are a smart person.
You should think carefully.

182
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,166
<i>Did you receive the snacks I sent you?</i>

183
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,041
<i>Are they delicious? Have you eaten them?</i>

184
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,625
I received it. I'm opening it now.

185
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,083
<i>Here you are. How about you?</i>

186
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,333
<i>Where have you been?</i>
<i>Are you still working?</i>

187
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,333
Yeah, but I'm off work soon.

188
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,750
<i>Why did you have to send me</i>
<i>all these cookies?</i>

189
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,750
<i>Just save up when you get paid.</i>

190
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,291
<i>Any month you don't have enough,</i>
<i>no need to send me anything.</i>

191
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,541
Mom, the boss
has just promoted me to a manager.

192
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,458
Now I get 50,000 baht a month.

193
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,333
Really?

194
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,416
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,875
I'll send some to you every month.

196
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,458
No need. Save it for yourself,
and don't waste money.

197
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,000
Now you can even eat whatever you want.

198
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
We can cook a whole cow or a pig.

199
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,750
You can even buy out all the books
to build a library at home.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,416
The cookies are so tasty. Thank you, son.

201
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,791
I'll share them
with the kids at the church.

202
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,458
Don't give too much, Mom.
Keep some for yourself.

203
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,208
Is Thong home? Can I talk to him?

204
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,708
<i>Thong.</i>

205
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,375
<i>What's up, bro?</i>

206
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,333
Listen. I'm in Bangkok now.

207
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
Why the hell are you there?

208
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:08,375
<i>To work for more money.</i>
<i>Do not tell Mom about this.</i>

209
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,041
<i>Look after her for me, okay?</i>
<i>I'll keep sending you guys money.</i>

210
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,541
Alright.

211
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,083
When are you coming home?

212
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,666
When I got a hundred kilos of it.

213
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,416
BANGKOK

214
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,333
UDOM TRAVEL AGENCY

215
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,833
What's his name? His name is Li Mingxiu.

216
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,333
Water.

217
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,000
Use my phone.

218
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,125
Sure.

219
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,833
You… One, two, cheese.

220
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,833
We can do two more,
Wat Phlapphla Chai and Wat Mangkon.

221
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,333
Okay. Here you are.

222
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,708
- Help me too.
- Help me too.

223
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,208
My honey bottle’s all broken now.

224
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,791
How are you going to compensate?
Pay me back now.

225
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,208
Be careful.

226
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,333
I'd like to ask you, what kind of pillow
would you use for ten years?

227
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:58,958
- Give me one.
- Give me one.

228
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,250
SANTI SAELEE

229
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,875
Yo, where's Mr. Dom?

230
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,375
Oh, he is out to manage some bills.

231
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,541
Are you Jimmy? Please take a seat.
I'll make you some tea.

232
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,125
- Hmm?
- I'm Santi.

233
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,583
Mr. Dom told me to look after
your VIP clients.

234
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,416
Are you new?
I don’t remember seeing you around.

235
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Not quite, sir.
I've been doing it for a month.

236
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,958
Do you always have VIP clients?

237
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,750
Yeah. Why do you ask?

238
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,750
Nothing.

239
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,375
Those thick gold necklaces
really caught my eye.

240
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,208
Being a real estate agent
for Chinese clients

241
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,208
must really pay off.

242
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,833
Not that much.

243
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,833
What's the commission rate?
How much do you get per room?

244
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,708
Do you want me to help sell some for you?

245
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,208
I take in
hundreds of tourists every month.

246
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,541
Selling a condo is a piece of cake.

247
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,750
Jimmy. Jimmy, let me do it.
What do I need to do?

248
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,416
What are you talking about?

249
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,625
Each unit costs tens of millions.

250
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,333
It's not as easy as tricking them
to buy your stupid pillows.

251
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,916
Jimmy. I'll be honest with you here.

252
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,333
I think those pillows
are much harder to sell.

253
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:37,250
Think about it.
Those are something nobody wants.

254
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,041
No one would have thought of carrying it

255
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,666
on three connecting flights
back to Chongqing.

256
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,916
Does it sell well?

257
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,458
The whole bus bought it.

258
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,666
Actually,
many have asked for a quota to sell.

259
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,000
I can share some with you.

260
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,250
How much do you get per room?

261
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,125
This hundred thousand.

262
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,500
Five hundred thousand?

263
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,708
Damn. What a room.

264
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,833
- How many of these do you have?
- Forty.

265
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,916
Forty?

266
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,666
Five hundred thousand
for 40 rooms would be 20 million.

267
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,333
Tell me. How much
do I have to pay for my quotas?

268
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,500
It's hard to say. How much do you have?

269
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,583
One million. I want all 40 rooms, okay?

270
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,541
In cash.

271
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,875
I'd even give you two pillows for free.

272
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,375
This is a five-star cruise.
You will like it.

273
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,458
As for the food,

274
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,500
Jimmy told me that you are allergic
to shrimp and don't eat chicken,

275
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,541
so I specially arranged a top-grade steak.

276
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,750
The scenery inside is also superb.

277
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,250
You will see many temples later, such as
the Golden Bell Temple by the river.

278
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,833
Even the name is beautiful.

279
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,833
Then you will pass by an apartment…

280
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,375
You didn’t keep your promise.

281
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,666
What did my woman say?

282
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,875
She said you didn't keep your word.

283
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,666
Stop fooling around.

284
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,916
Bring it here.

285
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,791
This is my compensation for my lateness.

286
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,875
Is that it? Isn't it a bit too easy?

287
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,750
She said that this was not enough.

288
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,500
How about this? You eat first,

289
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:16,208
and then I will take you to the most
beautiful riverside apartment in Bangkok.

290
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,125
You can buy her a…

291
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,208
What a shitty apartment!

292
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,750
They didn't tell you what to do.

293
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,791
You're just a fucking translator.

294
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:27,458
Do your job well
and stop talking too much bullshit.

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,166
Here, this is for you.

296
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,041
I've already increased the credit limit.

297
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,791
Translate!

298
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,291
He has increased the credit limit for you.

299
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,583
Thank you.

300
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,625
I'm going to the bathroom.

301
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,708
Hey, can you help me with something?

302
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,416
I forgot my lipstick.

303
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,958
Can you ask around and borrow one for me?

304
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,416
You want me to go and ask for a lipstick?

305
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,791
Yes, you.

306
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,916
My lips are so dry,

307
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,666
he’ll think I’m a chicken
for Chinese New Year.

308
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,458
Go. I’ll help sell your condo.

309
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,708
- How many do you want?
- Just one.

310
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,666
Quickly. Get me a color
that won't make me look like a whore

311
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,958
or a ladyboy.

312
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,500
And what the hell is that color?

313
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,625
Just take it from someone beautiful.

314
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,833
Okay, got it.

315
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,083
The things are pretty good.

316
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,958
Yes. Okay.

317
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,750
I'll take a picture for you.
Wait a minute.

318
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,708
Sweet view, right?

319
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,166
I have an emergency
and need to use some lipstick.

320
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,791
Can I borrow yours?

321
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,666
Lipstick is a personal item.
It's not convenient.

322
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,083
How about this?

323
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,833
I'll buy it. How much?

324
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,708
Your lipstick is the most suitable
for me on this ship.

325
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:34,208
I think you have good taste.

326
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,291
Three thousand. Do you want it?

327
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,291
Three thousand?

328
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,875
You've used it.

329
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,750
How about 1,500?

330
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,166
How much did you pay for it?

331
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,291
I bought it for 1,500,
and I want to sell it for 3,000.

332
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,208
Do you want it?

333
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,708
Pretty, but so damn stingy.

334
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,791
I'm not. I'll make it 3,500 then.

335
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,958
You can speak Thai?

336
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:23,541
Do you want it?
If not, I'm leaving. One, two…

337
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:24,583
Alright.

338
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,333
I don't have enough cash with me.

339
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,583
Here's a thousand baht deposit.

340
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:43,375
This is my business card.

341
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,125
Where are you staying?

342
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,125
Since you're on this cruise,
is it the River Bangkok?

343
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:55,291
Then I'll give you the rest
at the hotel around nine p.m., okay?

344
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,291
See you tonight.

345
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,625
I'll go then.

346
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,500
I'll pick you up at ten o'clock
tomorrow to see the condo…

347
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,458
Hey. Try to show him pictures
of the condo tonight.

348
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,041
I'll handle the rest tomorrow.

349
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,833
You haven't finished your work yet.

350
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,500
Why are you leaving?

351
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,458
Come here. Sit.

352
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,000
Sir, I don't have this hobby.

353
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,500
What are you talking about?

354
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,333
I'm not asking you
to have sex with my woman.

355
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,666
I'm just asking you
to be a good translator.

356
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,666
Translate it well.

357
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,666
If I end up in the wrong position,
it's on you.

358
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,583
What the hell is this? I'm out.

359
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll give you three times.

360
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,000
You're just selling an apartment,
aren't you?

361
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:26,708
Come on. Show me your photos.

362
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,083
Oh!

363
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,500
How much?

364
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,500
Only ten million.

365
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,833
Ten million?

366
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,291
Do you fucking think I haven't been there?

367
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,666
This place is built
next to a garbage incinerator.

368
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,583
There's no one living there.
It stinks so bad.

369
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,291
Who the fuck would buy it?

370
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,416
You're just an idiot.

371
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,458
Fucking Jimmy.

372
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,125
This is my business card.

373
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:13,708
Look, I'll hold a birthday party
in Shanghai next Saturday.

374
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:17,083
My friends all like
to invest in real estate.

375
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,458
You can sell to them.

376
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,416
Hmm?

377
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,083
ZHANG SHIHAO

378
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,708
But you have to do
your translation work today.

379
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,125
Come here. Sit.

380
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:51,916
I'm telling you, don't peek.

381
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:08,208
I like the color of your lips.

382
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:11,958
I like the color of your lips.

383
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,333
Yeah, right there.

384
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,583
Yes.

385
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,958
Right there.

386
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,291
Stop fucking talking like that.

387
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,708
Don't moan, idiot.

388
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,125
Do your job.

389
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,083
I can't handle it anymore. Turn around.

390
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,291
Faster. Yeah.

391
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,000
Come on. Be gentle.

392
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,708
Yeah, sir. Yeah.

393
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,125
No, I can't hold it anymore.

394
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,541
Another posture.

395
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,375
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

396
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,416
Did the Chinese tourists

397
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,375
who went on the cruise
last evening leave the hotel?

398
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,083
That group checked out this morning.

399
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,916
- Okay.
- Right.

400
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,166
Sir. Are you Mr. Santi?

401
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,125
How did you know my name?

402
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:21,333
A Chinese tourist said you'll be wearing
Udom Agency shirt with a hole in the back.

403
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,583
Did she leave any messages for me?

404
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,333
She left you this.

405
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,750
FRAUD

406
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,208
- Thank you.
- Right.

407
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,375
Sorry. Can I take a photo here?

408
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,750
SHANGHAI

409
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,000
FUZHOU RD

410
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,708
ZHANG SHIHAO

411
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,166
Drink it quickly.

412
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,833
Do you think anything
will go better today?

413
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,250
Mr. Kanin!

414
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,500
Damn, what a small world.
I didn’t expect to see you here!

415
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,291
Do you remember me? Santi?

416
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,333
I was at your lecture in Lampang
last year.

417
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,375
I sold you a chair
worth 10,000 baht, remember?

418
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:23,875
The sand mining major guy.

419
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:25,875
Exactly.

420
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,458
Hey, it's you.

421
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,875
You did come.

422
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,625
Go. Let's have a drink.

423
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,916
Guys, let me introduce to you.

424
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,458
This is the interpreter
I hired in Thailand.

425
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,708
You can ask him
if you don't believe in me.

426
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,833
Hey, I want to ask you a question.

427
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,666
Lao Zhang said…

428
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,791
He bragged to us
that he didn't sleep all night.

429
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,083
Really?

430
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,666
I think he just took a lot of Viagra.

431
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,250
- It's you who took lots of fucking Viagra.
- Come on.

432
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,708
I'll hire you if I go to Thailand one day.

433
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Everyone must have been to Bangkok, right?

434
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,875
Where are the really good things
in Bangkok?

435
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,458
Does anyone know?

436
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,041
Women, right?

437
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,041
- Beautiful women.
- Of course.

438
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,958
Women.

439
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:15,958
Exactly.

440
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,583
You can say it's women,

441
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:21,291
but if that woman stands on the balcony

442
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,625
with you holding her waist and admiring
the sunset over the Chao Phraya River,

443
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,083
it is rare in the world.

444
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:32,750
Look at this project.
The location is really good.

445
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:36,125
The market price of this apartment
has reached 13 to 14 million.

446
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,041
I thought you were
introducing beautiful women to us.

447
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:42,416
But I only sell this batch
for ten million,

448
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,750
which is equivalent to two million RMB.

449
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:48,958
I wanna hear about
that bastard Zhang screwing his mistress!

450
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,708
Go. Let's have a drink.

451
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,583
Fine, my friend is unhappy.

452
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:01,875
Let's go to have a drink.

453
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:05,625
No, sir, I missed many orders.

454
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:08,083
I spent tens of thousands of yuan
on a plane ticket to get here.

455
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,583
You have to let me sell,
no matter what happens.

456
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,416
Drink it.

457
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,166
After you drink it, I feel sorry
for you, so I will buy one. Is that okay?

458
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,541
You are so annoying.

459
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,875
I'm here to sell the apartment,
not to beg.

460
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
Drink it or not?

461
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,041
If not, get out of here.

462
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,708
I drink one cup and you buy a unit, right?

463
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:49,958
The more I drink, the more you buy.

464
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:52,583
Look at you.

465
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,875
You'll fall down
after three drinks like a dog.

466
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:20,958
If I drink 40 cups, then you buy 40 units.

467
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:25,125
If I can't drink all of them,
you don’t have to buy any.

468
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,041
Do you dare?

469
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,625
He is so stubborn.

470
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,583
Come on, Zhang. We'll have some fun.

471
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,791
I dare to come here because I trust you.

472
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,125
Now I want to see
if you dare to bet with me.

473
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:41,458
Sure, we'll buy one unit each.

474
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:42,625
Stop talking nonsense.

475
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,541
What the hell does it have to do with you?

476
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,958
Wait.

477
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,458
Whiskey is too light.

478
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:56,458
I have Serbian wine,
which is twice as strong as that one.

479
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,500
Do you dare?

480
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:22,625
You have to keep your word,
otherwise, you are a dog.

481
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,458
Listen to me.

482
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:35,791
This carpet cost me several million RMB.

483
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,166
If you dare spit on it,

484
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,083
I will make you lick it clean like a dog.

485
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,583
One unit.

486
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,250
The second cup.

487
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,125
Two units.

488
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,166
The third cup.

489
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,916
The challenge of young people.

490
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,083
The fourth.

491
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,208
Drink. One more.

492
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,666
Good.

493
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:00,958
Yeah.

494
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:01,958
The sixth.

495
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,208
Place your bets.

496
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,083
Who bets on this guy to win?
Buy one and get ten.

497
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,916
Okay.

498
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,125
- Who bets on me…
- Who?

499
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,625
will make a fortune.

500
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,041
Come on! Let's go!

501
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:26,583
One more.

502
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,625
Hey, hey, hey!

503
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,875
Fuck. You haven't even
drunk half of it yet.

504
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:34,458
Are you so weak? Go on!

505
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,750
Have someone serve that table some water.

506
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,458
Your booze is fucking soft!

507
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,041
Look at me! Look at me!

508
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,833
He is so crazy.

509
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,083
You've drunk 20 cups. Go on.

510
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,833
Don't let him drink anymore.

511
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,291
Or he will die.

512
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,458
Should we call an ambulance?

513
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:20,333
Okay. Cut the crap. Get out of the way.

514
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,000
Are you okay?

515
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,416
Hey, hey.

516
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,125
Zhang, calm down.

517
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,041
Shut up.

518
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,833
Stand the fuck up!

519
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,791
Stand up.

520
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,291
Zhang, calm down.

521
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,958
Trash!

522
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,375
You're just a piece of trash.

523
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,708
Why did you bring me water?
I'll drink alcohol.

524
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:40,541
I want to be fucking wide awake!

525
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,875
What the fuck are you doing?

526
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,625
<i>Hello.</i>

527
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:52,041
Hello, sir. I'm Santi.

528
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:57,833
<i>Shit. You're still alive, bastard?</i>

529
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,875
Did I drink 40 cups last night?

530
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:04,750
<i>Forty cups?</i>

531
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:10,041
<i>You didn't even drink 30 cups,</i>
<i>and you almost set my house on fire.</i>

532
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,958
<i>How dare you call me?</i>

533
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,583
<i>Huh?</i>

534
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:18,458
<i>Are you still at our house?</i>

535
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,500
<i>There is a bowl next to the sofa.</i>

536
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:25,833
<i>It's my dog Jiji's bowl.</i>

537
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,625
<i>I am going to Shenzhen soon.</i>

538
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,500
<i>Can you help me express it to Shenzhen?</i>
<i>I can give you the address.</i>

539
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,750
The shipping fee is five yuan.

540
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:20,791
Your information has been logged in.

541
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:21,791
It will be delivered to you
within three days.

542
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:23,625
Take care.

543
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:24,791
Hello. Where are you sending it to?

544
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,416
Shenzhen.

545
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,250
Shenzhen? The shipping fee is five yuan.

546
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:35,375
- Shenzhen?
- Yes, Shenzhen.

547
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,250
It's only five yuan
for such a long distance?

548
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:40,875
It takes you five yuan minimum
to deliver nationwide.

549
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:44,416
FIVE YUAN MINIMUM TO DELIVER

550
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,375
Here.

551
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,166
Next one. Where will you send it to?

552
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,666
Beijing.

553
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:54,000
FANG XIN

554
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,000
Hello. Welcome aboard.

555
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,208
Hello. Welcome aboard.

556
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:03,708
Welcome. Uh, sir. This way, please.

557
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:14,083
You'll be seated right here, sir.

558
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,583
My seat is here?

559
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,208
Yes, it's this seat.

560
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,541
I saw you at the gate,

561
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,375
so I upgraded your ticket
to this seat next to mine.

562
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,916
Mr. Kanin.

563
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,041
Is this okay?

564
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Of course.

565
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,541
Okay, I’m not going
to be shy about it anymore.

566
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,791
Oh.

567
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:46,791
Damn. This seat is huge.
You're so fricking awesome, sir.

568
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,583
You want some more?

569
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:50,291
Sir.

570
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,083
My head is still buzzing.

571
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,125
Hi. Can I have a glass of water?

572
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,625
Hmm. Oh.

573
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,708
Last night…

574
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,625
why didn't you drink the water
in those shot glasses?

575
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:06,250
Wait. Those were from you?

576
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,083
Hmm.

577
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,291
I'd like to know you more.

578
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,250
I'm thinking of inviting you
to work with me.

579
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,625
I'm honored, sir.

580
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:27,083
But I'm done working for someone else.
I’ll never be rich in this life.

581
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:30,208
I’d like to be first in line,
just like you said.

582
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,125
Hmm.

583
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,333
You can do it. What do you want to do?

584
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,541
Can you believe it?
I just found a business opportunity today,

585
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,083
and it's what I want to do the most.

586
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,958
A great opportunity
that no one in Thailand sees.

587
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:52,666
But I was lucky enough to see it.

588
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,166
My heart is pounding
just thinking about it now.

589
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,500
Care to tell me about it?

590
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,791
I can't. I wouldn’t be first in line.

591
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:10,166
I'll take all 40 units of the condo
you were trying to sell last night.

592
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:15,208
All of them? Are you serious?

593
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:21,916
I am. Consider it a fee for prying.

594
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,833
Okay.

595
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,583
Do you know

596
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,166
that the express delivery service fee
in Thailand starts at 50 baht?

597
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,208
But here, in China,

598
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,583
I saw today
that it starts at only 25 baht.

599
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:50,083
At a price this low, they must have
such an efficient process and system.

600
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:51,541
Here's my plan.

601
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,041
I'm going to partner
with an express delivery business in China

602
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,625
and bring the service to Thailand
at the lowest fee possible.

603
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:59,166
If it’s half the market price,
everyone will choose me.

604
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:05,833
Economy price, business-class service.

605
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,500
Cheaper shipping
will reduce sellers' costs.

606
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:16,125
When things are cheaper,
people will buy online more.

607
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,375
The more people buy,
the bigger the market grows.

608
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,250
The more people buy,
the bigger the market grows.

609
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,916
The more people buy,
the bigger the market grows.

610
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,416
My business will make a ton of profit.

611
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,916
Sir.

612
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,125
Do you want to be the first
in line with me?

613
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,666
When you said you wanted to be rich,
how rich are we talking?

614
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:55,125
A hundred million baht
would last me my entire life.

615
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,500
You know what?

616
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:09,125
Everything you just said
is a ten-billion-baht business.
