1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,102
Junseong.

2
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,445
Do you take me for a pushover?

3
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,247
 One winter day when I was in middle school... 

4
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:35,477
 I had this conversation with my parents. 

5
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,078
 Minwoo. 

6
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,875
 You may not have realized it, 

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,237
 but you were born into a family that is more wealthy than others. 

8
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:47,740
 but you were born into a family that is more wealthy than others. 

9
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,285
 That's why you get to live in a fine house in a nice neighborhood 

10
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,930
 and attend great schools surrounded by good people. 

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,707
 But... this world isn't just full of good people. 

12
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,884
 But... this world isn't just full of good people. 

13
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,403
 In this world... 

14
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,053
 There are a hundred times more bad people than good... 

15
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:11,972
 No. A thousand times more. 

16
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,732
 Really? 

17
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:17,853
 That is why I've decided to send you to a regular high school. 

18
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:20,289
 That is why I've decided to send you to a regular high school. 

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,515
 Gosh, it's hot. 

20
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,775
 - This is so delicious. 
 - It's good. 

21
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:26,094
 Is your dad really a chairman, Minwoo? 

22
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:28,572
 - No. 
 - Hey, don't lie! 

23
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,015
 - We've heard everything. 
 - Don't lie. 

24
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,659
 What are you, then? 

25
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,894
 - Your family must be loaded. 
 - I'll have one more, Minwoo. 

26
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,789
 - Can we have more sundae and tteokbokki? 
 - Don't we have some left? 

27
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,432
 Things will be completely different there. 

28
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,751
 Things will be completely different there. 

29
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,879
 Your classmates might even attack you at times. 

30
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,173
 Minwoo. 

31
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,008
 Where have you been? 

32
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,135
 - The first floor. 
 - I see. 

33
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:51,787
 Can you lend me 30,000 won? 

34
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,664
 I'll pay you back. 

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,183
 Being wealthier than others doesn't mean that you have to be giving all the time. 

36
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,186
 Being wealthier than others doesn't mean that you have to be giving all the time. 

37
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,647
 - You need 30,000 won? 
 - Yes. 

38
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:06,735
 If someone tries to take advantage of your wealth, 

39
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,404
 you must show them that you're not to be messed with. 

40
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:11,806
 you must show them that you're not to be messed with. 

41
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,856
 But who are you? 

42
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,111
 Dealing with such people toughened me up bit by bit. 

43
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,163
 Dealing with such people toughened me up bit by bit. 

44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:32,385
 Here's one thing that you must always keep in mind. 

45
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,372
 Don't ever let anyone push you around. 

46
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,768
 And thus I'm not the Park Minwoo that I used to be. 

47
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,897
 And thus, I'm not the Park Minwoo that I used to be. 

48
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,815
 I'm not weak. 

49
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:48,192
 No one can ever mess with me. 

50
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:51,262
 That's what I thought. 

51
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,557
 That's what I believed. 

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,797
 I guess I still have a long way to go. 

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,000
   

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,920
   

55
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,830
   

56
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,100
   

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:33,040


58
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,968
   

59
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,794
   

60
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,112
   

61
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,596
   

62
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:17,933
People rarely get a perfect score on the fitness test.

63
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,210
You must have worked hard.

64
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,039
You've been preparing for it for so long,

65
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,275
so I'm not worried about your interview.

66
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,253
- Are you still doing the community patrol? 
 - Yes.

67
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:32,031
You'll get extra points for mentioning that during your interview

68
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:35,259
since that's also a part of police work.

69
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,078
I've been reviewing the previous interview questions,

70
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,164
but the group interview worries me.

71
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:42,224
Isn't your brother in the force?

72
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:44,810
Doesn't he give you any pointers?

73
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,003
He wouldn't have any.

74
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,672
- I don't expect much from him. 
 - Why not?

75
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:52,651
They never should have accepted him in the first place.

76
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,169
   

77
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,198
Ma'am.

78
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,099
My brother.

79
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,456
This is ridiculous.

80
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,168
I have better things to do.

81
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,054
You've kidnapped me?

82
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,824
Stop joking around and untie me.

83
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,117
This isn't funny at all.

84
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,571
   

85
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,182
 This is not a joke. 

86
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:26,660
Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Lee Junseong!

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,286
Junseong!

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,047
You carried me on your back last night.

89
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,998
I remember that much, at least.

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,658
Untie me right now.

91
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,366
 You don't know who I am. 

92
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,676
 You have been kidnapped. 

93
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,138
Hey.

94
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,066
You're pushing me over my limit.

95
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,299
 This is your last reminder. 

96
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,967
 If you don't stay silent, you'll be put in grave danger. 

97
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,303
 If you don't stay silent, you'll be put in grave danger. 

98
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,864
Fuck you.

99
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,933
Fuck you, you pieces of shit!

100
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,102
- Let go of me! 
 - Hey!

101
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,738
Let me go, you jerk!

102
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,983
You bastard!

103
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,626
Let go!

104
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,295
Let go of me!

105
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,129
Hey!

106
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,966
So it really is you, Junseong.

107
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,451
I recognize your cheap cologne.

108
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,932
I can smell it, you moron.

109
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,649
Fuck!

110
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,981
Hey.

111
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,650
What do you think you're doing?

112
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,836
 You better get things straight. 

113
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,257
 We have no intention of releasing you, no matter what you say. 

114
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,242
 Do you understand? 

115
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,724
Hey.

116
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,876
You just said "we."

117
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,957
What the...

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,407
♫  Red octopus, orange octopus, yellow octopus  ♫

119
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,036
♫  Green octopus, blue octopus, purple octopus  ♫

120
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,481
♫  Brown octopus, white octopus, black octopus  ♫

121
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:40,532
♫  Pink octopus, navy octopus, gray octopus  ♫

122
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,993
What about Director Hwang?

123
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:50,203
He's there on site.

124
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,585
One, two, three.

125
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:58,720
- We can do it! 
 - We can do it!

126
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,173
Thank you for everything, Director.

127
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:02,866
I should be thanking you, Mr. Yu.

128
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,968
Don't mention it.

129
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,270
Welcome.

130
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,824
What's this?

131
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:28,858
Move.

132
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,623
Get out of my way!

133
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,161
Mr. Cho.

134
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,204
It's been a while, Ma'am.

135
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,442
To what do I owe this pleasure?

136
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,689
My son...

137
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,242
has been kidnapped.

138
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,447
Your best course of action would be to report it to the police

139
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,258
Your best course of action would be to report it to the police

140
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,370
or to hire a competent private investigator.

141
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,731
I could introduce you to someone if you'd like.

142
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,152
That'd be the only thing I could do for you.

143
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,589
One more thing.

144
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,359
Don't ever come to see me again like this

145
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,236
over something that isn't business-related.

146
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,415
I'm warning you.

147
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:39,253
Give my regards to your late husband.

148
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:48,696
Shouldn't I be the one issuing such a warning?

149
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:55,745
If that's an ultimatum, I should be the one giving it to you.

150
00:09:56,622 --> 00:09:59,599
If you don't help me,

151
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,336
I'll go to the police directly.

152
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,021
I'll tell them that the director of the Youth Baseball Federation

153
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,448
I'll tell them that the director of the Youth Baseball Federation

154
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:09,368
runs an illegal sports betting operation

155
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:13,639
and that we're working together.

156
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,082
I'll tell them everything.

157
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,606
Are you threatening me now?

158
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,568
Not at all.

159
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,654
I'm giving you an order.

160
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,756
The choice is yours to make.

161
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,533
You could either go down with a mother who has lost her son or not.

162
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,244
You could either go down with a mother who has lost her son or not.

163
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:36,886
You could either go down with a mother who has lost her son or not.

164
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,742
Get the details of her son and handle it...

165
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,105
before that cow loses it and spills the beans.

166
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,123
   

167
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,668
   

168
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,903
Fuck...

169
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,035
Where are you going?

170
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,761
I have classes.

171
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,824
Now?

172
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,836
What about it?

173
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,762
What's different now?

174
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,718
He knows everything.

175
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:34,845
How will you handle it?

176
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:38,740
He might suspect us for now,

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,501
but he'll believe us in time.

178
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,456
Junseong,

179
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,109
when it comes to humans, our emotions trump reason at all times.

180
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,154
when it comes to humans, our emotions trump reason at all times.

181
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:56,617
That's how our brains are programmed.

182
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:58,410
What I'm saying is, even if he suspects us now,

183
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,437
What I'm saying is, even if he suspects us now,

184
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:03,389
he'll buy our story sooner or later.

185
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,052
Does that mean...

186
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,006
he won't know that it's us?

187
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,707
Exactly.

188
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,528
Damn it.

189
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:22,308
Why do you have to be so logical?

190
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:25,687
So?

191
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:28,223
When will you get his mom to pay up?

192
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,845
Let's wait for a few days.

193
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:35,989
I'm sure she's in a dilemma right now, too.

194
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,890
What sort of dilemma?

195
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,303
Whether to report it to the police or not.

196
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,721
That's also an important issue for us.

197
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,337
I'll get going.

198
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,264
I have something really important today, so I have to go.

199
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,211
Excuse me.

200
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,408
Me?

201
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,335
Cops visited your place last night. Right?

202
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,521
That's right. And?

203
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,475
I was the one who reported you.

204
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,543
I see.

205
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,923
We made a ruckus, didn't we?

206
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:37,092
I'm sorry about that. It won't happen again.

207
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,710
That's not it.

208
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,847
I don't think you understood me.

209
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,600
I don't think you understood me.

210
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,751
All the noise you make...

211
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,313
can be heard in my unit.

212
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:59,031
What exactly did you hear?

213
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,699
Something breaking.

214
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:01,842
- Something crashing. 
 - Come on!

215
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,760
- Something crashing. 
 - Come on!

216
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,645
People exchanging blows and screaming.

217
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,755
You little...

218
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,791
In other words, I heard people fighting to the death.

219
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,018
In other words, I heard people fighting to the death.

220
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,799
Did you hear a sob, too?

221
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,225
A friend of mine cried a river.

222
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,931
Of course.

223
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,058
Men shouldn't cry like that.

224
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,859
It's so off-putting.

225
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,372
- No one cried. 
 - What was that?

226
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:32,273
- No one cried. 
 - What was that?

227
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:34,508
Sorry? It was nothing.

228
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,068
I get what you mean.

229
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:38,052
I'll be more careful going forward.

230
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,527
Who does he think he's talking to?

231
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:03,152
   

232
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:38,047
   

233
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:56,273
   

234
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,036
Where do I submit this form?

235
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,909
What is it?

236
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,836
An appeal form against disciplinary action.

237
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,607
The seal is missing here.

238
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,459
It needs to be stamped.

239
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,903
I need approval from one of the professors to dispute the decision they made?

240
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:20,156
I need approval from one of the professors to dispute the decision they made?

241
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,657
Yes.

242
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,584
Why is that?

243
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,264
That's just how the rules are.

244
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:32,001
Technically speaking, it wasn't their decision.

245
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,727
It was the school's.

246
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,812
But the professors...

247
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,500
It's the professors who make up the school's disciplinary committee.

248
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,118
It's the professors who make up the school's disciplinary committee.

249
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:46,406
You still need their seal of approval.

250
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,628
You may be tested on the structure of the skin,

251
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,214
so remember to revise that. That will be all.

252
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,624
 - Thank you. 
 - Thank you. 

253
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,758
Good job today.

254
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,455
What do you want?

255
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,133
I need your seal.

256
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:23,010
   

257
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,571
I don't have my seal right now. Come back later.

258
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,865
When? I need it now.

259
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,408
Come back later.

260
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:30,643
I'm in a rush, sir.

261
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,202
Please stamp it now.

262
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,911
I don't have my seal with me.

263
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,290
Set up an appointment first, and I'll stamp it for you.

264
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,926
I don't have time for that when I'm about to be expelled.

265
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:46,967
   

266
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:53,740
Take it.

267
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,577
What is it? Do you need something else?

268
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:09,131
- Professor Cho. 
 - Yes?

269
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,850
You know that I wasn't in on it alone. Right?

270
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,231
I mean, I'll admit that I organized the cheating ring,

271
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:20,918
I mean, I'll admit that I organized the cheating ring,

272
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,212
but it was a group effort.

273
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,588
Other students organized it for other subjects.

274
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:29,702
Why am I the only one getting expelled?

275
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:31,695
Why am I being expelled when other students only got held back or suspended?

276
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,981
Why am I being expelled when other students only got held back or suspended?

277
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,397
You were the only one who got caught.

278
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:46,134
The others didn't.

279
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:51,599
But I submitted the messages and emails as evidence.

280
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,242
Jaehyo,

281
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:56,403
this is a school. We're not an investigative body.

282
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:59,223
You cheated on an online exam and were caught by the professor in charge.

283
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,590
You cheated on an online exam and were caught by the professor in charge.

284
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,486
You even admitted it on the spot.

285
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,720
Those are the facts.

286
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:09,758
We don't know anything about the evidence you gave us.

287
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,652
Even if such events occurred, no one was caught.

288
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,379
Even if such events occurred, no one was caught.

289
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,283
Hey.

290
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:22,646
How many times do I have to tell you?

291
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:25,116
File a lawsuit if you feel so wronged.

292
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:26,775
Don't bother making appeals and dragging the department's name through the mud.

293
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,711
Don't bother making appeals and dragging the department's name through the mud.

294
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,005
Let's go.

295
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,350
How much do you need?

296
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:37,853
What?

297
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,207
Moon Sanghwi, Park Hyunwoo, and Jung Hyunjin.

298
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,317
Moon Sanghwi, Park Hyunwoo, and Jung Hyunjin.

299
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,110
Moon Sanghwi, Park Hyunwoo, and Jung Hyunjin.

300
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,906
Their parents paid you and the school off.

301
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,957
I know that, too.

302
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:56,246
You insolent punk...

303
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,952
Would 500 million be enough?

304
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:06,022
   

305
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:20,186
   

306
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:24,066
What is it?

307
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:27,686
   

308
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,977
Dad.

309
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,114
- Hey, Junseong. 
 - You came?

310
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,709
- Goodness. Is that you, Junseong? 
 - Hello.

311
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:42,935
It's been a while.

312
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,728
Have you been well?

313
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:47,989
- You're a man now. 
 - Come on.

314
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,694
You're hard to get a hold of.

315
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,778
I know.

316
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,282
What's the rush, anyhow?

317
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,908
Well, they're looking for catering at a construction site nearby.

318
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:02,596
Well, they're looking for catering at a construction site nearby.

319
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,498
I'll be back soon. It won't take long.

320
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,167
Okay. I can't stay for long, though.

321
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,419
I told you.

322
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,212
I'll be busy for a while.

323
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:12,231
Doing what? Did you get a job?

324
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,157
No.

325
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:16,819
I'm just helping someone out.

326
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,362
Who are you helping?

327
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,933
Did you get a girlfriend?

328
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,852
How would I get a girlfriend?

329
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,770
I don't have one.

330
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,163
All right.

331
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,582
I get it can be frustrating, but hang in there.

332
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,460
If this catering job goes well,

333
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,487
I'll open up another restaurant for you.

334
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:37,948
All right? Auntie, I'll get going.

335
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:40,608
See you.

336
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,277
See you.

337
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,559
- Junseong. 
 - Yes?

338
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,275
- Junseong. 
 - Yes?

339
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,161
Take your dad to see a doctor when you're free.

340
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,671
He has frequent stomachaches.

341
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,558
His name is Park Minwoo.

342
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,828
The last call made from his phone was traced to Sillim-dong.

343
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,549
And the little punk used his credit card in Hyoseong-dong yesterday afternoon.

344
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:14,610
And the little punk used his credit card in Hyoseong-dong yesterday afternoon.

345
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,212
It was for a company-owned taxi.

346
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,990
The license plate is "23B 4572."

347
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,968
There aren't any more transactions after that.

348
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,237
I'm looking for 4572. That's 5545.

349
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,254
Four-five-seven-two.

350
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,030
Twenty-three B...

351
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,276
Twenty-three B...

352
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,352
Twenty-three B, four—

353
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:45,214
That's 4572.

354
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:47,067
I've found it.

355
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:54,733
Hello, sir.

356
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:57,527
Do you drive this taxi?

357
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,323
- Why do you ask? 
 - I just have a few questions.

358
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:04,593
Yesterday afternoon— Gosh, that startled me.

359
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,345
 Sir! Sir! 

360
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,413
 Sir! Sir! 

361
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:41,488
Give me a moment.

362
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,742
I'll pay you back by next week.

363
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,468
I'm not a debt collector.

364
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,245
Relax.

365
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,663
What's this about?

366
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:51,932
Around 6:00 p.m. yesterday, did you pick up a man in his early twenties?

367
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,476
Around 6:00 p.m. yesterday, did you pick up a man in his early twenties?

368
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,261
A man?

369
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,282
Don't you remember him?

370
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,347
I'm not sure.

371
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:12,895
If you tell me the truth, I'll reward you.

372
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,012
If you tell me the truth, I'll reward you.

373
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,167
How much?

374
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,493
The entire amount you owe today.

375
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,225
It was around 5:40 p.m.

376
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:29,311
I picked him up at the Dorim intersection.

377
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,147
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

378
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,374
 Hyoseong-dong rodeo, please. 

379
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:37,443
Didn't he call or contact anyone?

380
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:39,964
He didn't call anyone, but he seemed to be texting.

381
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:41,632
He didn't call anyone, but he seemed to be texting.

382
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:43,025
One more thing. He said he was running late and asked me to hurry.

383
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,643
One more thing. He said he was running late and asked me to hurry.

384
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:48,555
That's all I remember.

385
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,449
I don't have anything else. I swear.

386
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,880
Why did he run anyway all of a sudden?

387
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,786
We can't get his text messages. Right?

388
00:25:10,786 --> 00:25:12,997
Do you mean his mobile messenger records?

389
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,106
Yes.

390
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,542
We'd need his phone to do that.

391
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,935
Or a warrant.

392
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:22,707
How about we do this instead?

393
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:25,159
Why don't we go looking for him from the point where his phone died?

394
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,053
Why don't we go looking for him from the point where his phone died?

395
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:30,372
- Where? 
 - Sillim-dong, obviously.

396
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:33,309
That's where college students live.

397
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:36,369
A lot of students rent places there.

398
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:46,996
 Excuse me, sir. Could you speed it up a bit? 

399
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:50,283
 - Sure. 
 - Thank you. 

400
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,155
He must've been meeting someone he knew.

401
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:58,150
A friend.

402
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,645
♫  Red octopus, orange octopus, yellow octopus  ♫

403
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:05,299
♫  Green octopus, blue octopus, purple octopus  ♫

405
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,614
   

406
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,326
♫  Although we have different colors  ♫

407
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:20,122
♫  We are all good friends  ♫

408
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,857
♫  Red octopus, orange octopus—  ♫

409
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,820
   

410
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,539
 Let's go get drunk. 

411
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,291
 What should we get? Sashimi? 

412
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,367
 Let's have some meat. 

413
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,219
My dad's meeting the professor today.

414
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,789
- Tell your parents, too. 
 - Why am I getting suspended?

415
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:19,082
I paid them a fortune.

416
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:34,931
Hey, Song Jaehyo.

417
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,381
I'm sorry.

418
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,834
What for?

419
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:47,269
What?

420
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,385
Hey.

421
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,536
What are you sorry about?

422
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:10,526
   

423
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,455
Here you go.

424
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,353
Isn't today your day off after night duty?

425
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:23,789
That's right. It's my day off,

426
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:28,686
but some heroic officer fired a taser out of the blue.

427
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,796
Someone fired a taser in this part of town?

428
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,131
Who was it? And where?

429
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:35,609
Where else but the college town in your neighborhood?

430
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,070
We were dispatched because of a noise complaint,

431
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,764
but these two guys went ballistic.

432
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:44,284
Officer Kang and I had to bring them here in cuffs.

433
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,496
I applied here hoping it would be quiet since it's near a college,

434
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,523
but not a single day goes by in peace.

435
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:53,034
- Wasn't there another man with them? 
 - What?

436
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:53,636
I mean, you said you brought in two men in cuffs.

437
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:56,138
I mean, you said you brought in two men in cuffs.

438
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:58,881
Weren't there three men there?

439
00:29:58,881 --> 00:29:59,934
There weren't.

440
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:01,735
I only saw two.

441
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,489
   

442
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,609
Hey, honey.

443
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:37,663
Can we check the security camera footage without your mom knowing?

444
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:21,807
   

445
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:25,586
 Contact from now on will be made from an untraceable number. 

446
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,872
 Contact from now on will be made from an untraceable number. 

447
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:31,983
 Do not panic because of it. 

448
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:43,553
What?

449
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,175
What's this?

450
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,280
Darn it.

451
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,162
Hello?

452
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:11,665
 I told you not to contact anyone, 

453
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:13,591
 didn't I? 

454
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,271
I don't follow.

455
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,715
I told you not to go to the police.

456
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:21,866
Did you not hear me?

457
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:28,282
What parent would go to the police when their child has been kidnapped?

458
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,601
What parent would go to the police when their child has been kidnapped?

459
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:34,271
I didn't share this with anyone.

460
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:37,608
We have our eye on you at every moment.

461
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:39,051
Don't you forget it.

462
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:41,320
Of course not.

463
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,121
Excuse me.

464
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:45,933
What about Minwoo?

465
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,718
Is he doing well? Is he okay?

466
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:17,314
Yes. He's doing fine.

467
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:20,083
Let's talk about his ransom.

468
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,891
 Can you prepare one billion won in cash by tomorrow? 

469
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,450
 Can you prepare one billion won in cash by tomorrow? 

470
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,145
 Try to buy some time when they bring up the money. 

471
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:33,438
 Buy as much time as you can. 

472
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:37,918
Tomorrow's too soon.

473
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:40,362
I'd need at least three days.

474
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:44,315
I'll do my best to get it ready in two days.

475
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:58,130
Get it done by tomorrow.

476
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,341
I want the full amount in 50,000-won bills.

477
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,418
Otherwise, Minwoo's a dead man.

478
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,444
Otherwise, Minwoo's a dead man.

479
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,611
I need...

480
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,907
Jeez.

481
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:51,992
   

482
00:34:51,992 --> 00:34:54,810
 What did you just ask for? 

483
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,480
My medicine...

484
00:34:58,057 --> 00:34:59,558
Medicine?

485
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:04,713
   

486
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:23,983
Thank you for walking me home.

487
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:27,159
- It was nothing. Go inside. 
 - Good night.

488
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,463
This is patrol three. One woman went home safely.

489
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,115
We'll head back to the station.

490
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:33,742
Let's take the back alley on our way.

491
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,953
To patrol? Sounds great.

492
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:37,404
   

493
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,059
 The person you have called— 

494
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,035
