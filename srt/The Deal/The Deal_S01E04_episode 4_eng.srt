1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,497
 My late father was the founder of a huge investment company. 

2
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:13,597
 He invested a ginormous amount of money. 

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,264
 A mind-boggling amount. 

4
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:22,664
 Right before he died, he took me somewhere. 

5
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:27,597
 I'd never been there before. 

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,997
 It was some kind of storage container. 

7
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:43,597
 My dad told me a lot of surprising things that day. 

8
00:00:44,464 --> 00:00:48,130
 He said that our company was involved in illegal activities. 

9
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,630
 At that moment... I realized. 

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,630
 I was standing... 

11
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:03,530
 in my dad's secret safe. 

12
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,397
 There was a ton of money. 

13
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,930
 Like tens of billions of won. 

14
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:17,364
 I'd never seen so many yellow bills piled up like that 

15
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:20,230
 in my entire life. 

16
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,264
 I touched the money with my own hands. 

17
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:28,897
 Billions, no, tens of billions. 

18
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,097
 I'll give you that money. 

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,564
 Money that no one knows exists. 

20
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:47,297
You mean... instead of 500 million,

21
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:48,764
we'll get 10 billion?

22
00:01:48,764 --> 00:01:50,797
There could be even more.

23
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,530
I guarantee it.

24
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,264
You said your dad suddenly died of a heart attack.

25
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:03,830
Well, he had prior symptoms.

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,564
His health was going downhill.

27
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,630
What a load of bull. This punk is lying.

28
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,830
Jaehyo, why would I lie in this situation?

29
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,230
Fuck off, you bastard!

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,497
You think you can dupe me twice?

31
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:19,130
Didn't you say you would stay quiet until we get the money, huh?

32
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,930
Jjapagetti, you prick! Argh...

33
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,264
Doesn't that mean we don't have to kill him?

34
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,530
It would be like the kidnapping never happened.

35
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:32,697
What?

36
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,755
As if he staged it.

37
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:40,022
Right! That's what I'm saying! Yes!

38
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:45,022
If we split that money, we all become accomplices.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,840
   

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
   

41
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,720
   

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,840
   

43
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,890


44
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:55,908
   

45
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,855
 Hello? 

46
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,380
One billion won. Is it ready?

47
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,680
 Sindap Station, 11:00 a.m. Don't forget. 

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
Okay.

49
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:12,580
One car, one person.

50
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,446
I'm going alone.

51
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:17,180
Prepare to alert the police this time.

52
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,380
We need a plan B.

53
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,246
Don't let Director Hwang know.

54
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,380
Okay.

55
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:42,572
   

56
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,037
   

57
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Where are you going?

58
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:26,155
About the address Minwoo gave...

59
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,322
There are actually storage containers there.

60
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,955
His story checks out.

61
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,555
So?

62
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:38,422
If you have the time, maybe we should go check it out.

63
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,655
I have a morning class.

64
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,355
Hey, we're in this together.

65
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,355
Who says I won't help?

66
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:52,122
You want me to ditch class, then?

67
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,288
How did it go?

68
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:20,688
What did Jaehyo say? Is he willing to accept my offer?

69
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,588
You're not lying, are you?

70
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:39,788
The money is really stored there. Right?

71
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:44,355
Absolutely! I'm a terrible liar.

72
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:56,988
You better not be playing with us.

73
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,688
Or you'll pay dearly for it.

74
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,455
Yeah.

75
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:14,855
Back inside.

76
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:16,388
Yeah.

77
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,788
Ah.

78
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,455
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

79
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:30,222
Thanks.

80
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:52,555
They both went out. You can relax.

81
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,822
Okay, let's try and put this all together.

82
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:59,288
So you're saying those two punks have someone locked up?

83
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,188
So you're saying those two punks have someone locked up?

84
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:05,255
Yeah, and they said if they split the money

85
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,688
they won't have to kill him.

86
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:11,755
Accomplices to a staged kidnapping?

87
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:15,222
Not 500 million won, but tens of billions?

88
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:19,755
Excuse me!

89
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:27,288
We witnessed a kidnapping last night.

90
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:30,822
Okay, I will get in touch, sir.

91
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,688
- Good. 
 - Thank you.

92
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,655
Huh?

93
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:36,255
Hello.

94
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:40,122
What are you doing here?

95
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:48,022
You witnessed what?

96
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,155
Kidnapping? Where?

97
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,588
Neighbor.

98
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,455
The house in front?

99
00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:56,822
They have someone locked up to be exact,

100
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:58,955
but it could escalate to murder.

101
00:09:58,955 --> 00:09:59,855
- It's pretty serious. 
 - Hold on.

102
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:01,922
- It's pretty serious. 
 - Hold on.

103
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:05,188
How did you find out? Any evidence?

104
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:09,088
I went inside the house with Cheol's mom's master key.

105
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,122
The other day, I heard loud fighting from the house and called the police.

106
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,455
The other day, I heard loud fighting from the house and called the police.

107
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,522
The cops came and checked it out,

108
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:19,122
but they said they only saw two people when I knew there were three.

109
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:22,055
So you entered someone else's house? Without permission?

110
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,522
Two guys have a kid locked up.

111
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:27,688
Whatever it is, don't you know your actions constitute a crime, too?

112
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:30,022
I know, of course I know!

113
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:33,288
But should I just sit back when the cops won't do anything?

114
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:34,488
Hey, Cha Suan.

115
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:35,655
What?

116
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,422
Don't you have an interview coming up?

117
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:41,022
Shouldn't you be focusing on that instead of wasting your time like this?

118
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:43,055
Shouldn't you be focusing on that instead of wasting your time like this?

119
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:45,222
At this rate, you'll fail again!

120
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:46,455
What?

121
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:49,022
You sure have a way of getting to me like this.

122
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,788
Yeah, you're so smart, you passed in a year

123
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:54,155
- and dumb me is still an aspiring cop. 
 - Hey, that'sâ€”

124
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:57,588
But I refuse to be irresponsible like you.

125
00:10:57,588 --> 00:11:01,088
If that's what cops are like, then I don't want to be one!

126
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,488
Why don't you save that after you have become a cop?

127
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:21,555
The station was asking when you're coming in.

128
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,022
I'm heading over there.

129
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:31,188
But first, can I take a look at the dispatch records?

130
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,155
Mr. Park Minwoo?

131
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,455
   

132
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,635
   

133
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,788
 It will be easy to find. 

134
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:36,055
 "WN" is written in big letters on the outside. 

135
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,388
Geez.

136
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:08,922
Where the hell is it?

137
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:22,355
W... N.

138
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:36,788
What? Three locks?

139
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:39,022
Who are you?

140
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:53,955
You should've come straight to the office if you wanted to get a quote.

141
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,088
I'm sorry.

142
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,922
This place is huge.

143
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,322
I lost my way.

144
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:04,055
You think I didn't see you sneaking in through the back?

145
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:04,988
- What? 
 - Forget it. What is it you want to store?

146
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:08,322
- What? 
 - Forget it. What is it you want to store?

147
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:12,355
FYI, we don't take any illegal stuff.

148
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:16,288
Of course, it's nothing like that.

149
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,455
Just clothes, and... hats, shoes...

150
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,622
Just clothes, and... hats, shoes...

151
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:25,088
Okay, let's see. The rate is...

152
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:42,855
Uh, sir,

153
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,888
is it also possible to store personal items in there?

154
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:49,822
is it also possible to store personal items in there?

155
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,888
Like what?

156
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:54,955
- Drugs? 
 - No, no.

157
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,322
It's nothing like that.

158
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:59,622
I mean, something like...

159
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:02,288
a safe.

160
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,867
Sure, a lot of people do that.

161
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,855
Really?

162
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,155
That container you were looking at.

163
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:16,288
The customer is using it as a safe.

164
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,655
Oh, is that so?

165
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:13,188
   

166
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,688
 Have you arrived? 

167
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:24,822
 Yes. 

168
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,755
 You came alone. Right? 

169
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:36,522
 Yes. 

170
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,355
 I don't believe you. 

171
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,922
 How can I make you believe me? 

172
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,655
 Prove it. 

173
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,288
 Get on the train that's coming in. 

174
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,179
   

175
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,623
   

176
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,122
 Get on the opposite train. 

177
00:16:58,122 --> 00:17:01,722
 If you don't, Minwoo will die. 

178
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:16,988
Hey!

179
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:19,355
- What? 
 - Get out of the way!

180
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:27,088
No! No, no!

181
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,388
Hurry, hurry. Move!

182
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,455
Move! Get out of the way!

183
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,888
 Did you make it? 

184
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,155
 Yes. 

185
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,888
 Get off at the next station. 

186
00:17:55,155 --> 00:18:00,088
 But you must get off from the first door of the first car. 

187
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,988
 1-1. 

188
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,888
 Transfer to Line 1 at this station. 

189
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,822
 You must go to Jongno 3-ga Station. 

190
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,470
   

191
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:48,922
 Go to Yaksu Station. Transfer to Line 3. 

192
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:03,222
 I'm changing the location. Take Line 5 to Singil Station. 

193
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
   

194
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,350
   

195
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,855
 The train is arriving soon. You're going to miss it. 

196
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,455
 You'd better hurry or Minwoo will die. 

197
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:38,088
 At Singil, transfer to Line 1. 

198
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:41,522
   

199
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:46,988
 Wait for my text at Bakseon Station. 

200
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,455
 Have you arrived? 

201
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:39,888
 Yes. 

202
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:46,188
 Put the bag on the rack in the next train and get off. 

203
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:52,922
 The train bound for Dongincheon is now approaching. 

204
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,522
 Did you leave the bag on the train? 

205
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,455
Hello?

206
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:19,955
 Why didn't you do as I ordered? 

207
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:24,288
Answer me.

208
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:31,288
There's no guarantee you'll let my son live after you get the money.

209
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:33,555
You want Minwoo to die?

210
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:38,594
If my son dies, that will be your death sentence!

211
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,455
Answer me.

212
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:47,355
 You're watching me right now, aren't you? 

213
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:52,022
Listen carefully.

214
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,955
Without proof that my son is alive,

215
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:59,455
you can kiss the money goodbye. Got it?

216
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:02,700
 Minwoo is still alive. 

217
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,388
 You can have my word on that. 

218
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:10,155
I don't need your word, I want proof! Give me proof!

219
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:12,855
 One more thing. 

220
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:17,722
If you so much as harm a single hair on my son's head,

221
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:21,988
you're all dead meat. Understand?

222
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:52,222
 The train bound for Dongducheon is now approaching. 

223
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,188
Yes, we found her.

224
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:22,422
We didn't spot the abductor.

225
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:27,655
 Over here! 

226
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:34,255
Okay, I'll call. Yes, thank you.

227
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:42,655
   

228
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:45,855
   

229
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:49,455
Geez, why isn't he reading my texts?

230
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:12,555
You told me I should go to the police, so why stop me now?

231
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:17,522
I first met your husband 20 years ago.

232
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:20,288
His company, Woonam Corp, was on the verge of bankruptcy.

233
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:23,022
His company, Woonam Corp, was on the verge of bankruptcy.

234
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,755
You think I have the luxury to listen to your old stories?

235
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:33,422
We resuscitated his company

236
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:37,722
by using it as a money laundering machine for our organization.

237
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:40,455
by using it as a money laundering machine for our organization.

238
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:55,355
Of course, we also benefited.

239
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:58,455
We have grown into a huge supermarket doing business in China and Southeast Asia.

240
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:01,222
We have grown into a huge supermarket doing business in China and Southeast Asia.

241
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:06,855
Both our businesses were able to flourish

242
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,688
because of the pact of secrecy we had kept.

243
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:12,155
because of the pact of secrecy we had kept.

244
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,688
So when you threatened me, asking for my help,

245
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,822
So when you threatened me, asking for my help,

246
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:21,122
I immediately sent Mr. Cho to help you out.

247
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,248
I was afraid you would divulge our secret.

248
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:29,522
I know how painful and distressing this must be for you.

249
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:34,222
But involving the police is out of the question.

250
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:36,555
Once the police investigation starts, it will bring Woonam into the spotlight.

251
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,188
Once the police investigation starts, it will bring Woonam into the spotlight.

252
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:42,255
No matter how hard we try to keep a lid on our secret,

253
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:45,355
No matter how hard we try to keep a lid on our secret,

254
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:50,988
it will put our business at risk.

255
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:54,588
We will find your son no matter what.

256
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:56,422
If he comes back dead,

257
00:26:56,422 --> 00:27:01,155
we will inflict the same suffering on those responsible.

258
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:07,422
You expect me to trust you and wait when our trust has already been broken?

259
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:10,988
Just as your son is precious to you,

260
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:15,388
this business is more precious to me than my life.

261
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,288
Move.

262
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:35,388
We need the names of the friends your son has been hanging out with recently.

263
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,788
I said move.

264
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,288
Reunion.

265
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:52,588
He went to a high school reunion a few times.

266
00:27:55,843 --> 00:28:00,155
I'll give you three days. Bring back my son by then.

267
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:02,255
Alive.

268
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:18,622
Hey!

269
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:23,255
What's up? You didn't answer my texts.

270
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:25,422
Why did you call me out here?

271
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:29,555
It's this place.

272
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,055
What is?

273
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:33,822
This is where I made the call to Minwoo's mom.

274
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:38,655
I made the call here early this morning.

275
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:42,188
I told her to bring one billion won.

276
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,255
And I went to pick up the money today.

277
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,355
What the fuck?

278
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:51,322
Without even telling me?

279
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,622
So... how did it go?

280
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,188
So... how did it go?

281
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:57,955
I did everything as planned.

282
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:01,022
Made her transfer from one subway line to another.

283
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,822
So did you get it?

284
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:07,523
No, I didn't.

285
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,923
Damn it. Why?

286
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:14,155
Everything went according to plan at first.

287
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:17,855
But, fuck, at the last minute...

288
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,788
Minwoo's mom refused to listen to me.

289
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:25,922
She said she would hand over the money only after proof that Minwoo was alive.

290
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:33,122
I think there is someone behind this.

291
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:35,355
I saw people following her.

292
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:37,722
They were watching her from a distance.

293
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:40,622
Cops? Did you get caught?

294
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:43,322
No, that's not it.

295
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:46,688
Damn it. I don't know. Ah...

296
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:52,004
I'm sure they didn't see me.

297
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:55,944
So only you saw them? You think that makes sense, huh?

298
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,922
Damn you, you prick.

299
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:01,155
Hey! What are you doing, huh?

300
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:02,922
What are you doing!?

301
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:05,455
We're fucked, you idiot.

302
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,188
What are you doing...

303
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,322
- Junseong. 
 - Damn you.

304
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:10,555
Junseong, hear me out.

305
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,888
Fucking let go.

306
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:16,522
It didn't work out this time because I went there alone.

307
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,622
You and I together, we can persuade her, we can coerce her.

308
00:30:19,622 --> 00:30:22,788
While I deal with Minwoo's mom, you can take photos and videos in real time.

309
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,222
Cut the bullshit, you bastard!

310
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:30,655
This is all because you let Minwoo go. Isn't it?

311
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:33,355
Isn't it because you let Minwoo go?

312
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:35,088
You're trying to pin it on me?

313
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,955
Wasn't it you who wanted to kidnap Minwoo?

314
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:41,055
So, damn it, we don't need to fight.

315
00:30:41,055 --> 00:30:45,222
If we want to live, we have no choice...

316
00:30:47,855 --> 00:30:49,555
but to kill him.

317
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:55,088
Fuck.

318
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:57,922
How did you stoop so low?

319
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:02,222
Then what the fuck am I supposed to do, huh?

320
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:04,588
What should I do?

321
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:08,355
Hey, you think my parents are doing well abroad?

322
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:11,522
I haven't fucking heard from them in ages.

323
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,433
Junseong.

324
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:21,188
Please, I'm begging you.

325
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:24,622
I really need that money. Without it, I'm dead.

326
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:28,188
My life will be over. So, please...

327
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,255
I'm begging you.

328
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,419
Get lost.

329
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:42,022
Fuck!

330
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,332
   

331
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:58,022
What?

332
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,520
   

333
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,855
Miae.

334
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:25,122
What happened?

335
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:28,355
Why is Dad getting surgery suddenly?

336
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:39,022
The doctor said his stomach was all rotten.

337
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:44,722
Apparently, his organs were removed by a quack.

338
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:46,788
You hear me?

339
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:51,588
When? Why?

340
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:56,255
What do you think? To pay off your gambling debt, you bastard.

341
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:01,355
After you ran off to the army,

342
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:06,755
do you know how much the debt collectors harassed us?

343
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,830
Get lost. I don't want to see your face.

344
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,855
Get lost!

345
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:34,355
 Take care of yourself. 

346
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:36,722
 And make sure to call. 

347
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:39,875
 Yeah, okay. 

348
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,322
 I'm going. 

349
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,522
 Junseong! 

350
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:18,688
 I'll take care of the debt. 

351
00:34:19,922 --> 00:34:23,655
 So don't worry and look after yourself. 

352
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:28,755
 Just stay healthy. That is what's most important. 

353
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:36,022
 Son! 

354
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:40,588
 I love you. 

355
00:34:46,622 --> 00:34:49,488
 Go.  I'm leaving. 

356
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,100
   

357
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:40,522
When I was serving in the army...

358
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:45,022
there was one thing I vowed.

359
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,388
What is it?

360
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,822
I vowed never...

361
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,655
to let my dad down again.

362
00:35:58,655 --> 00:36:00,355
That I'd live a new life...

363
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,722
after I was discharged.

364
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,822
Guess I was screwed from the start.

365
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:16,088
I didn't know, but my life is fucked up anyway.

366
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:27,122
I'm sorry.

367
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:31,622
No, it's not your fault.

368
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,955
I made the choices.

369
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:46,388
Jaehyo.

370
00:36:48,555 --> 00:36:50,222
If...

371
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:56,388
we do as Minwoo says, but it turns out to be a hoax,

372
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:03,422
let's go with your original plan then.

373
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,522
I won't stop you. I won't get in your way.

374
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:15,422
Please, Jaehyo, just think it over.

375
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:18,622
That's the best option in this situation.

376
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,688
Jaehyo.

377
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:33,955
Jaehyo, I...

378
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:39,922
I really don't want to disappoint my dad anymore.

379
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:45,288
So can you do as I say, just this once?

380
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:51,355
If you go along with me, then...

381
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:55,022
I will do anything you ask me from now on.

382
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,955
Huh?

383
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:58,988
Huh? Jaehyo.

384
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:04,588
Please, Jaehyo.

385
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:16,788
Is three days enough?

386
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,655
Answer me.

387
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:25,788
I only have three days.

388
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:32,222
No, two is enough.

389
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:34,922
How is that?

390
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:38,322
I have a plan.

391
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:22,188
Let's do it.

392
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:24,255
Let's fucking do it.

393
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:34,222
Anyone home?

394
00:39:39,655 --> 00:39:42,836
   

395
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:03,040


396
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,018
