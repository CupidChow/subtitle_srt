1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,100
Ma'am.

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,300
Hold on.

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,400
How long did I sleep?

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Five to six hours.

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,700
I vowed to not even

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,600
take a sip of water until Minwoo came back.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,800
And yet... I slept like a log.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,900
Your body couldn't take it any longer.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,000
My body has accepted it.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,400
The death of my child.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,800
You have a visitor.

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
The director would like to see you.

14
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,430
   

15
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,280
   

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,330
   

17
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,900
   

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,300
   

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
There's a hunting ground near the crime scene.

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,800
The people there all hunt illegally.

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,700
It's like a battlefield even during the day.

22
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,580
I think she was probably shot while wandering around the area.

23
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,400
   

24
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,000
Hear that?

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,000
I have good news and bad news.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,800
The good news is that your son is alive and well.

27
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,700
The bad news is that your son and his friends

28
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,100
have put our organization at serious risk.

29
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Are you able to recognize his face?

30
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,000
How can a mother not recognize her child's face?

31
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
That's all I needed to know.

32
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
See that?

33
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Typical of a parent, a mother.

34
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,700
All she cares about is that her child is alive.

35
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,900
It doesn't matter one bit that he put other people at risk.

36
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,500
As long as her son is alive.

37
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,100
That's perfectly understandable as a parent.

38
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,900
But...

39
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,100
isn't it wrong for her to act that way in front of me?

40
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,600
When money has been stolen from the safe.

41
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
Aren't I right?

42
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,300
You're right, sir.

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Find her son and kill him.

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Kill the deranged mother, too.

45
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Kill them all.

46
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,100
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,500
How much progress have you made?

48
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,400
Are you close to finding my son?

49
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,500
We're searching for the vehicle.

50
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,800
It won't be too long.

51
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Sir! Sir!

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,200
We just found the kids. They're in a motel nearby.

53
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
It's not too far from here.

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Lead the way.

55
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,380
   

56
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm telling you I saw that prick using a phone last night.

57
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,400
He fucking smashed all our phones and he had one stashed away!

58
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,100
What's this?

59
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,800
What the fuck are you guys planning to do to me?

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Huh? Hey!

61
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Hey! Shut your hole!

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
You fucking talk too much.

63
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,716
All done? We should change cars first.

64
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm going to the store. Want something to eat?

65
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
I'll be back.

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Lee Junseong, I know you two are bosom buddies.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,700
But you need to think carefully. This isn't the way!

68
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,400
Who do you need right now?

69
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,200
It's not him, but me and my mom.

70
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't need all that money.

71
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,900
Just 500 million won, as we had planned.

72
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,600
But...

73
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,300
We can't leave out Jaehyo.

74
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,300
Why... on earth do you stick up for him?

75
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,500
Ah... all right, okay. I got it.

76
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,000
500 million each, ten billion in total. I'll talk to my mom, but...

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,100
Do you think Song Jaehyo will readily agree to it?

78
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
I'll have to persuade him.

79
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,220
Scoot over.

80
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,500
We're all set, right? Let's get going.

81
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,300
What about the food?

82
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,600
Ah.

83
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,600
They were out of stock. Completely sold out.

84
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,300
What are you doing? Let's get going!

85
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,013
   

86
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh...

87
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,449
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure we can catch the perp.

88
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,683
There are no witnesses or CCTV cameras.

89
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:10,700
And all the hunters are covering each other's backs.

90
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,200
As you must know, it's anything but easy.

91
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
So what are you suggesting?

92
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,900
We should just give up?

93
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:31,183
We don't know anything.

94
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:36,416
We don't know why she came all the way here from Seoul, how she came here,

95
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,500
or why she had no belongings.

96
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,400
She's supposed to be studying at home, and instead she's lying on that cold table

97
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
and yet we don't know a thing!

98
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,100
Brother!

99
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,800
Please.

100
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Only family members are allowed inside.

101
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,700
I just want to see her face. Please.

102
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,900
No, you're not allowed.

103
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,200
I just need to see her face.

104
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
- No. 
 - Please!

105
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,000
I said you're not allowed!

106
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:15,149
It's okay.

107
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,600
Brother, what happened?

108
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,100
Yeah, okay.

109
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,400
We checked the CCTV footage,

110
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,000
and Lee Junseong and Song Jaehyo are the culprits,

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,600
and it's true that Park Minwoo was kidnapped by them.

112
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Anything else?

113
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
We checked the internet history,

114
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,900
and they searched for burner cars all last night until this morning.

115
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
So they intend to change cars.

116
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,400
They're pretty smart, right? These young punks—

117
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,100
That's great, then.

118
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,800
You stay here and search all the used car dealers in the vicinity.

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Each and every one.

120
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
Didn't you hear me?

121
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
Okay.

122
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
And we're going to go to Seoul right away.

123
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:55,636
   

124
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,700
Do we really have to do this?

125
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,900
We have no choice. Car dealers are all a bunch of thugs.

126
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,900
I'll be outnumbered if I go alone.

127
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Still, this is a bit...

128
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,800
It's only for a short while.

129
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Step back.

130
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,400
What are you doing? Step back.

131
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,700
Stay in the car. I'm going in alone.

132
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,400
   

133
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Director's orders.

134
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,700
He wants us to back you up.

135
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Enjoy.

136
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:41,549
Where is your father?

137
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,400
Did you come to collect money?

138
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,783
No.

139
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:52,683
Then why are you asking about my dad?

140
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Because I don't see the owner anywhere.

141
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,500
A young girl like you couldn't possibly be the owner.

142
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,000
Liar. People wearing clothes like that don't eat at this place.

143
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,600
You caught me.

144
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,200
Have you heard from your brother?

145
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
Find him yourself and ask him.

146
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,700
A person's life is at stake!

147
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,500
My dad is in the hospital now because of that prick!

148
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
He's in critical condition! Do you know?

149
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
   

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,600
Thank you for the meal.

151
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,530
   

152
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,300
Lee Junseong's father is in the hospital.

153
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,600
He's bound to call him.

154
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,100
Send me a car.

155
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Mr. Cho had some business to attend to.

156
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,700
We will take you home.

157
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,700
I will take you home.

158
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,516
Hello.

159
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,800
How can I help you?

160
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:10,483
We came to look at a car.

161
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,583
What kind of car?

162
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,583
Uh...

163
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,000
A burner car.

164
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,500
Boss! Boss!

165
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:36,649
Oh, hello! What are you looking for?

166
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,427
Come in, come in. Come on in.

167
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Wow, you're in luck.

168
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,300
We have the perfect car for you.

169
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,700
It's a 2007 van with only 300,000 kilometers on it.

170
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,400
Practically a new car.

171
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,500
So, how much do you want for it?

172
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,600
It's a bargain. Including commission, it's 30 million won.

173
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
30 million won in cash?

174
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Of course.

175
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,600
In return, we don't need your ID or anything.

176
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,800
Isn't this what you wanted?

177
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,600
I'll grab the cash.

178
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:44,019
   

179
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,600
Hi, I'm from Homicide Unit Three.

180
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,700
I need a phone location and an APB on a car.

181
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,100
Unit Three?

182
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,000
   
   

183
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Your chief already processed this through the system.

184
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
We obtained additional information.

185
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,800
It was originally just a larceny case, but drugs were found.

186
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,200
Ah... Is that so?

187
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,400
You can send the info just to me.

188
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
- Okay. 
 - Can you rush it, please?

189
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,600
It seems like you need a big car.

190
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,400
We have one, it's an Istana. It's a palace on wheels.

191
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,800
Oh, I see.

192
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,700
We have a lot of sedans, too.

193
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Yeah, well...

194
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,600
- Hey! Our van's fucking gone! 
 - What?

195
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I looked everywhere, but it's gone!

196
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,900
See, it's gone.

197
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,600
Our van's gone!

198
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,200
I looked everywhere and it's gone!

199
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
Fuck, how is this possible?

200
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,300
Fucking shit.

201
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,200
I told you we had to kill Park Minwoo, didn't I? Huh?

202
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,100
Those thugs... The thugs couldn't they have followed us here? Huh?

203
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,400
Otherwise, this doesn't make sense. Ah, fuck!

204
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,800
Hold on... Damn it.

205
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,300
What do we do now?

206
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
What do we do? What are we going to do!?

207
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Hold on! Hold on!

208
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,500
The car key.

209
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
Who has the key?

210
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400
Don't you have it?

211
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I gave it to you last, didn't I?

212
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
You fucking dickhead!

213
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,600
How can the car move when you have the fucking key!?

214
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,300
Hey, look at that!

215
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,400
Hey! Hey! See that?

216
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,300
That prick took the van.

217
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,100
He can't have gone that far yet.

218
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,500
- Okay, okay. 
 - I'm going to get that asshole. Okay?

219
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,400
Jaehyo, come here for a sec.

220
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,500
Fucking let go of me.

221
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,900
- Jaehyo, wait. 
 - Let go of me!

222
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,100
- Come here, damn it! 
 - Fucking let go!

223
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,583
You fucking asshole!

224
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,100
Get your shit together, Song Jaehyo!

225
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,500
How can I when everything's screwed, huh?

226
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,400
My life is totally fucked!

227
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:09,716
It's fucked up!

228
00:22:10,883 --> 00:22:12,983
Excuse me!

229
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Isn't your car parked on the third floor?

230
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,900
You came down a floor with our manager earlier, didn't you?

231
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,800
We're here, ma'am.

232
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,549
Yongho, you seem like a good person.

233
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,800
But...

234
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,400
if you want to kill me, find my son first.

235
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:46,116
We'll do the job tonight.

236
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll do it myself, so stay out of it.

237
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,200
It's the director's orders.

238
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:23,349
   

239
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,300
- Yeah. 
  - We found the rats. 

240
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,300
We confirmed the car model and plate number.

241
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,000
They left here around ten minutes ago.

242
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,800
 So I think we can catch up to them in no time. 

243
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,900
Wait for now.

244
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,200
 Pardon? 

245
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,600
 If you send us backup, we can— 

246
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:49,849
   

247
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,100
How is everything at the restaurant?

248
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,700
Did you try calling Junseong?

249
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,200
 He's not picking up. You try. 

250
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,200
I'll be out of the hospital tomorrow, so hang in there a little longer.

251
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,900
 Tomorrow? 

252
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,400
 What are you talking about? That's way too early. 

253
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,543
I'm fine.

254
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,404
Let's talk again.

255
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Is that you Junseong?

256
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Who are you?

257
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,100
Are you Lee Junseong's father?

258
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
   

259
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm with the police.

260
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,516
I need to use the restroom.

261
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,300
   

262
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,700
Wait, wait, wait.

263
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:29,194
Over here.

264
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,417
You can go here.

265
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:46,383
What is it?

266
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,200
How far are you going to take this?

267
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I'll be outside.

268
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Are you okay?

269
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,300
I kicked your leg earlier.

270
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,500
Is it okay?

271
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,100
Yeah.

272
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,316
And you?

273
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
I'm fine.

274
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,600
To be honest...

275
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm super scared.

276
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,900
I'm scared that we might end up... really killing Minwoo.

277
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:20,449
What about you?

278
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:30,383
When I was in the military, you know what I kept thinking?

279
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,841
That I should've continued playing soccer.

280
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:39,649
Even if I was treated like shit,

281
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,700
I should have stuck it out.

282
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,900
Then I wouldn't have gambled or be debt-ridden.

283
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,800
And my dad...

284
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Maybe that's why...

285
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,600
I really... just wanted to see you become a doctor.

286
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,600
You're right.

287
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
That woman... We didn't kill her.

288
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
And it's right that it was in self-defense for the guy.

289
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
But not Minwoo.

290
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
If we really kill Minwoo,

291
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,800
we really become murderers.

292
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,283
Jaehyo.

293
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,600
Let's end it here.

294
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:09,249
We've really come too far.

295
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:12,916
We have to stop now.

296
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,700
Let's go back.

297
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,383
Huh?

298
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,000
What the hell?

299
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
Hey! Hey!

300
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,400
   

301
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,100
Hey!

302
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:03,416
Hey! Hey!

303
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,140
Fuck!

304
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,400
You asshole!

305
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,300
Fucking bastard.

306
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,600
Fucking let go, you bastard!

307
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,300
Hey! Hey!

308
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,800
Hey! You fucker!

309
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,900
Why are you flipping out and chasing me?

310
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,100
Are you crazy? Huh?

311
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,300
You're the fucking crazy one, bastard!

312
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,100
Honestly, what did I do to you to deserve this?

313
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm your friend too, aren't I?

314
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,000
Do I look like a pushover to you, you bastard?

315
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You put me in a fucking suitcase.

316
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,900
I told you I couldn't breathe, you fucker.

317
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,600
I couldn't breathe, you bastard!

318
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,300
Hey!

319
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
That's nothing. Now it's your turn.

320
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,500
Yeah? Let's all just fucking die today!

321
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Fuck off, you asshole!

322
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,460
Fucking asshole...

323
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,600
Fucking asshole!

324
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,300
Come here, you asshole!

325
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,100
Fucking asshole.

326
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,600
You asshole!

327
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,383
Fucking asshole.

328
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:22,800
Fucking asshole.

329
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,700
Die. Fuck...

330
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,900
Die! Die! Fucking bastard!

331
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,549
You asshole!

332
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:38,016
You shithead!

333
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,300
Asshole! Shithead!

334
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,100
You fucking asshole.

335
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,300
Fuck you!

336
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,800
You fucking asshole!

337
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,000
Fuck.

338
