1
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,750
Hey, Lee Junseong.

2
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:02,516
Hey!

3
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,883
Fucking answer me!

4
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,583
Answer me!

5
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:37,449
Lee Junseong, are you okay?

6
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,583
Come to your senses?

7
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:43,616
Come on, pull yourself together!

8
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,522
It's okay.

9
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,366
We're going to be okay.

10
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,993
That prick brought it on himself.

11
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,759
We're going to be fine. Okay?

12
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:03,849
You didn't kill him.

13
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:09,016
Fuck, I'm sorry!

14
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,883
I'm thirsty.

15
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,349
I'm thirsty.

16
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:44,383
Jaehyo, I'm sorry.

17
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,783
I think I ruined everything.

18
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,100
   

19
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
   

20
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,110
   

21
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,380
   

22
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:41,930


23
00:03:53,492 --> 00:04:00,800
   

24
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,483
In the past, I got in big trouble with Suan once.

25
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,240
- Why? 
 - For secretly going to an internet cafe.

26
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,040
   

27
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:15,632
I wondered how she found out where I was.

28
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,566
And it was by using this.

29
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,799
   

30
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,199
This is Suan's location?

31
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,732
Yes. he last location before her phone went dead.

32
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,666
Achasan.

33
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,099
What's that?

34
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:35,032
Song Jaehyo's last phone location.

35
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:36,632
Where does it say he was?

36
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:39,699
18-40 Achasan-ro, Guri, Gyeonggi Province.

37
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,632
Achasan? That's where Suan was.

38
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:46,599
So they were in the same place.

39
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,299
Those bastards...

40
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,532
Anything else?

41
00:04:56,832 --> 00:05:01,566
Sorry for asking to meet on such short notice.

42
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,532
It's okay, sir.

43
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,361
I'll keep it brief.

44
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,566
Why did you do that?

45
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,766
What are you talking about?

46
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,832
Why did you stop the men I sent?

47
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,766
Answer me.

48
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:28,490
I thought... it wasn't time yet.

49
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,666
We need her if we're to find the kids.

50
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:36,366
Our utmost priority right now is finding the money, isn't it?

51
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:43,183
I took in a parentless piece of shit,

52
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:46,949
fed him, and put a roof over his head for 20 years.

53
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,216
During all those years, you never went against me.

54
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,983
Why now?

55
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:59,716
Did seeing a mother's love for her child move your heart?

56
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,083
Mr. Cho.

57
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,616
I'll take care of her myself.

58
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:15,116
I'll make it as painful as possible.

59
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,316
Junseong,

60
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:38,183
once Minwoo is found, it will be a whole different ball game.

61
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,816
We need to think about what to do.

62
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:48,883
Can I... use your phone?

63
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,666
You have a phone, don't you?

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:07:00,566
The burner phone you used to call Minwoo's mom.

65
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:03,666
Didn't you use it to call your professor?

66
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:09,512
 Professor, did you see the photo? 

67
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,899
 I can get 500 million won. 

68
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:24,511
I didn't mean to keep it from you. I just kept it for an emergency.

69
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,721
I don't care.

70
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,993
I just need to make a call.

71
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:31,332
To who?

72
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:36,628
My dad... and the moneylenders.

73
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,394
Jaehyo.

74
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,732
Want to flee the country?

75
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,966
What?

76
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:57,667
After I pay off my debt and give some money to my dad,

77
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:01,594
let's leave the country.

78
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,316
No matter how hard I think about it, there's no other way.

79
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:08,916
Things just keep going downhill.

80
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:20,216
Before we're really fucked, let's leave.

81
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,883
Only if I plan everything and decide where we go.

82
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:37,016
No objections?

83
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,983
Cut the crap and just tell me where I should go.

84
00:08:56,983 --> 00:09:00,283
 So you actually have the money, huh? 

85
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:04,116
 I'll text you the location. Come by 12. 

86
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,883
Okay.

87
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,116
 Dad. 

88
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,849
Junseong?

89
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:33,211
 How are you feeling? 

90
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,083
 Are you okay? 

91
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,649
Where have you been all this time?

92
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:52,583
Dad, I won't be able to go home for a while.

93
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,016
 Why? What's wrong? 

94
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,049
Just take good care of yourself. Okay? Don't be sick.

95
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,416
Dad.

96
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:23,783
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

97
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:27,916
 I'm going to leave something in a locker at Daerim Station. 

98
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,416
Tell Miae to go get it later.

99
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,216
What are you talking about?

100
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:36,177
 Don't ask about the reason. Once I wrap things up, 

101
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,649
I'll call you again.

102
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,583
 Junseong. 

103
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:46,216
 Junseong. Hello? Junseong. 

104
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,339
I love you, Dad.

105
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:13,996
Detective, I apologize on behalf of my son,

106
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:17,535
so please go easy on him.

107
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,896
You don't have to worry.

108
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,649
We will find your son and bring him back safely.

109
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,700
We will find your son and bring him back safely.

110
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,516
Yes.

111
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,160
   

112
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,583
   

113
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,222
   

114
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,310
 I'm going myself. 

115
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:20,632
 Mr. Cho had some business to attend to. We will take you home. 

116
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,406
Minwoo.

117
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:22,016
I will tell you everything... about what happened.

118
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:27,040
As I said on the phone, we found it on patrol this morning.

119
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,231
The residents say it's been here for two days.

120
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,453
- Right? 
 - Yes.

121
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,732
Since early yesterday morning to be exact.

122
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,516
What's that?

123
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,149
Can we just barge in like this?

124
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,016
 The people there all hunt illegally. 

125
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,749
 I think she was probably shot while wandering around the area. 

126
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,083
Who are you?

127
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,883
The police.

128
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:44,383
Lieutenant Cha Jaegyeong of Gwanak Station.

129
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:57,583
This is everything. There's not much here.

130
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:07,883
Does that work?

131
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,892
Oh, that?

132
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,116
It's just a fake.

133
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:14,116
It's empty inside.

134
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:15,949
Why's that?

135
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,949
What do you think? We're short on money obviously.

136
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:24,883
Do you want to look around some more?

137
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:28,216
Suit yourself.

138
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,983
I'll be in touch.

139
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,983
Sure.

140
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:56,283
Brother, let's call it a day.

141
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:58,783
There's nothing here.

142
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,916
Huh?

143
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,016
What is it?

144
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,949
Is it Suan's?

145
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,983
Brother...

146
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,416
Three hours is enough. Right?

147
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,583
Yeah.

148
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:51,016
Then I'll meet with the money changer and figure out how to leave the country.

149
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:55,116
I don't think deciding on the destination will be an issue,

150
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:57,632
but since it's such a large sum of money,

151
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:00,408
I think it will take time to exchange.

152
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,149
Okay.

153
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,516
I'm off.

154
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,816
Hey, Junseong.

155
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:25,583
Nevermind.

156
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,483
See you later.

157
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,866
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

158
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:44,334
 Only if I plan everything and decide where we go. 

159
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,367
 No objections? 

160
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:52,283
 - I just need to make a call. 
 - To who? 

161
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,783
 My dad and the moneylenders. 

162
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:06,849
   

163
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:16,149
Yes, of course.

164
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,583
I understand what you mean.

165
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:25,549
Can you call back in three minutes?

166
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,283
Okay.

167
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:34,994
Is it the full amount?

168
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:37,160
Yes, sir.

169
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,270
   

170
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,283
To be honest, I never thought you'd pay this all back.

171
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:48,898
You know how to keep up your end of the bargain, huh, kiddo?

172
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,984
We're done, right?

173
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,856
I'm off.

174
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:55,516
Hold on, hold on.

175
00:20:56,683 --> 00:21:00,549
What's the hurry? I'm a little upset.

176
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,383
We've grown on each other.

177
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,583
Hey!

178
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,083
Long time no see.

179
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,816
 Junseong. 

180
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,883
I just got a request from someone.

181
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,895
They're willing to add 200 million to the 400 million you paid.

182
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:32,731
In exchange, they want us to sell your organs

183
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:36,083
and toss your body into the ocean.

184
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,549
And...

185
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,416
do you know who that person is?

186
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:46,506
Your friend.

187
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,375
Song Jaehyo.

188
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,783
He also asked this.

189
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:03,983
Once everything is ready, he asked to talk to you one last time.

190
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,949
Here.

191
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:25,116
Hello?

192
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:27,949
 Junseong. 

193
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,216
Yeah.

194
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,783
 You heard everything, right? 

195
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:36,607
Yeah, I did.

196
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,549
Talk.

197
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:40,749
I can't leave.

198
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,983
You know that.

199
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,883
Okay.

200
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:55,049
 I've thought long and hard about this. 

201
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:59,049
But there's no other way.

202
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:09,376
There's no other way... to turn my life around.

203
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:12,649
You know what I'm saying?

204
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,249
Yeah, I do.

205
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:16,716
Yeah.

206
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,083
I'm sorry.

207
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,116
No, don't be.

208
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:31,916
I'm sorry, too.

209
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:44,783
But, Jaehyo, it's not all going to work out the way you want.

210
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:52,749
Jaehyo... I really wanted...

211
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,550
to save both you and Minwoo,

212
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,139
but... I think I was in over my head.

213
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:10,183
You'll find out soon. Sorry, bye.

214
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,183
- Let's go. 
 - Fucking let go.

215
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,949
Let's go.

216
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:32,883
Fuck, don't touch me!

217
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,649
Fucking asshole! You asshole!

218
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:48,530
Fucking die, you shithead!

219
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:51,683
Don't!

220
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:58,183
You fucking son of a bitch!

221
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:00,416
Fucking let go! Asshole!

222
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,449
Asshole!

223
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:02,949
Let go, you fucker!

224
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,849
- Come here, you fucking bastard! 
 - You fucker.

225
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:09,049
Argh, don't!

226
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,916
You fucking bastards!

227
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,283
- You fucker. 
 - Fucking bastards.

228
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:15,149
Stay still.

229
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,249
Tie him up!

230
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:22,049
Hold his legs!

231
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,416
- Stay still. 
 - Hold him down.

232
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:28,449
Junseong.

233
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:34,183
I'm very sorry about last time, so I'll give you an extra dose today.

234
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,826
No...

235
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,997
Don't.

236
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:51,349
What the hell?

237
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,399
Who are you?

238
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,566
Where is Lee Junseong?

239
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,866
What the fuck—

240
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,232
Son of a bitch.

241
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,566
You motherfucker!

242
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:41,282
Who the fuck are you?

243
00:26:43,616 --> 00:26:45,449
Where's Lee Junseong?

244
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:46,983
What?

245
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,483
Forget it.

246
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:57,716
What the fuck, you son of a bitch.

247
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:02,683
You bastard.

248
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,549
Get out.

249
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,183
Where's your friend?

250
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,949
Lee Junseong!

251
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:11,516
Where's Park Minwoo?

252
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:14,178
Ask him yourself.

253
00:28:14,178 --> 00:28:16,683
He's alive...

254
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:35,216
Clean up the mess here.

255
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:37,149
What about Song Jaehyo?

256
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,583
Did you hunt him down, you punk?

257
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,449
Yes.

258
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:53,816
You crazy shithead.

259
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:15,749
Director Hwang isn't the only one who can play dirty.

260
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,616
 Find her son and kill him. 

261
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,885
 Kill the deranged mother, too. 

262
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,830
 Kill them all. 

263
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:33,516
 Ma'am. 

264
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,514
Why are you looking at me like that?

265
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:42,316
You're the one who planned to kill me first.

266
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:47,649
Doing away with me won't put an end to this.

267
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:54,983
That's only if Director Hwang is still alive.

268
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,400
I'll take charge of the syndicate and turn it into a department store.

269
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,100
Go back to the baseball stadium.

270
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
Thank you for everything.

271
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,400
   

272
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,483
What is it?

273
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
We finished the job.

274
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,000
What should we do with Lee Junseong and Song Jaehyo?

275
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,500
You should ask Minwoo about that.

276
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,849
   

277
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,649
Hello, Ms. Kim.

278
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,200
You woke up?

279
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,800
It's been a while.

280
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,652
How...

281
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:54,349
How long have I been here?

282
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,616
Three or four days.

283
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,400
You had an overdose of anesthesia.

284
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
It wasn't easy saving your life.

285
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,400
Why?

286
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,083
What do you mean why?

287
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,700
Why did you save me?

288
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,000
Because you saved my life.

289
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,884
You're one hell of an actor.

290
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:29,000
Pretending to choke me.

291
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:32,561
I didn't know what was going on.

292
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:39,149
 Minwoo... please die. 

293
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:41,800
 Please, just die. 

294
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,489
What is this?

295
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,000
What's he trying to do?

296
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:56,754
Then... I realized it.

297
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:58,500
Ah...

298
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,300
He's planning to ditch Song Jaehyo...

299
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:06,016
in order to save me.

300
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,900
How was my reaction?

301
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,800
Was it okay?

302
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:19,022
Jaehyo...

303
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,800
Where is he?

304
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
You want to know?

305
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:29,049
Deep down,

306
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,800
I wanted to kill both of you with my own hands.

307
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,700
But I couldn't do that to you.

308
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:45,827
You kept saying you were sorry.

309
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,000
And... you carried me on your back in gym class.

310
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,500
You're the only person who did that for me.

311
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm sorry... really.

312
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,583
No need to apologize.

313
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,400
We've gone too far for that.

314
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,049
Yeah.

315
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:37,420
Let's not cross paths ever again.

316
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,816
Yeah.

317
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,383
Take care.

318
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:04,583
Oh.

319
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,500
The stuff you stored in the subway locker. It's still there.

320
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,600
You do what you want with it.

321
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,000
Mr. Lee Junseong.

322
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,483
 Under the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes Act, 

323
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,400
 you are under urgent arrest on charges of kidnapping, 

324
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,100
 confinement, assault, and murder. 

325
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,200
 You have the right to an attorney and the right to refuse to answer self-incriminating questions. 

326
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:12,550
   
   

327
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:19,539
Sign the release form and check your belongings.

328
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:54,217
   

329
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,649
You can just discard this.

330
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,149
Okay.

331
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,383
One ticket for Jeonju.

332
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:19,583
Dong Seoul, 11:00 a.m.

333
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,940


334
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:35,950
 Thank you to our Channel Manager: bbj0424 

335

336

337
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900

338
