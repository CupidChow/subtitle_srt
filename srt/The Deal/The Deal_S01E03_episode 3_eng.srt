1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:10,100


2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 At that moment, a blurry memory resurfaced in my mind. 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,700
 At that moment, a blurry memory resurfaced in my mind. 

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,700
   

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
   

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,000
   

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,800
 - Guys! 
 - Stop him! 

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,500
 - Mark him! 
 - Pass me the ball! 

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
 - Go! 
 - Jaehyo! 

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
 Over here! 

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,400
 - Hey! 
 - Stop him! 

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
 - Seriously? 
 - Come on! 

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,500
 - Get him! 
 - Hey! 

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,300
 - What's he doing? 
 - He's coming! 

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
 What? 

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,900
 - What's wrong with him? 
 - Hey, Minwoo. 

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,200
 That lanky goalie was definitely Minwoo. 

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,600
 That lanky goalie was definitely Minwoo. 

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,800
 - What's going on? 
 - What do we do? 

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,400
 - Move. 
 - Check if he's breathing. 

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
 I remember it clearly. 

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,500
 - That's what happened then. 
 - Check if he's breathing. 

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
 I clearly remember it. 

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,300
 Minwoo. 

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
   

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
Hey.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,800
I don't remember that at all, no matter how hard I think.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I don't remember that at all, no matter how hard I think.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,700
How is it that only you remember that?

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,800
Do you have solid proof?

31
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,642
I don't.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But I'm sure that it was Minwoo.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,100
My memory is the proof.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Minwoo is putting on an act right now.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Minwoo is putting on an act right now.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,900
He's putting on a show.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
And you said yourself that he had a sunstroke then.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,100
And you said yourself that he had a sunstroke then.

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,400
Whether it was a sunstroke or a panic attack doesn't matter now.

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
The same thing happened again.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
You're not even a doctor yet, punk.

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,600
What?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Fine. Let's say you're right.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,100
Let's assume that you're correct.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,900
What do we do now?

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,100
I don't know.

47
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Let's get him some medicine first.

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,800
You should've discussed it with me if you had no idea.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
You didn't pick up the phone.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Was I just supposed to let him die?

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,900
That's not what I mean.

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Then, what?

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,900
Minwoo saw our faces.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
You... still remember how you promised not to hurt him.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,800
You... still remember how you promised not to hurt him.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,400
Right?

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Sure. I do.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
Of course, I do.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,900
But... the situation has changed now.

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
But... the situation has changed now.

61
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,700
It's a whole new ball game.

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Our hostage...

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
knows who his kidnappers are.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,070
   

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,040
   

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,790
   

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,010
   

68
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:36,026
   

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,900
Could he be inside the house?

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
That's the only reasonable explanation.

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
No way.

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Why didn't I think of that?

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,100
But here's what I don't get.

74
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,700
Why didn't the officers find him if he was inside?

75
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,400
Why did they lie and say it was just the two of them?

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,700
 Die, you bastard. 

77
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
 Die! 

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,400
 Damn it! 

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,800
That's possible, right?

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,700
I doubt it.

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Are you saying that there's a dead body in there?

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Are you saying that there's a dead body in there?

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Right in my building?

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
There might not be.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,500
If they already dismembered him, that is.

86
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
Murder and dismemberment?

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,374
Gosh.

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
We should get going.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Where?

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,100
To report it.

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,300
   

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm Kim Eunjeong, an investigator from the Financial Inspection Division.

93
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,600
Have you received any phone calls from someone claiming to be

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,400
the Police, the Prosecutors' Office, or any public or investigative agencies as of late?

95
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
the Police, the Prosecutors' Office, or any public or investigative agencies as of late?

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
I beg your pardon?

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
In other words, she wants to make sure you aren't a target of a phishing scam.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,000
In other words, she wants to make sure you aren't a target of a phishing scam.

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
That's not the case.

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
If so, has someone blackmailed or threatened you

101
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,800
If so, has someone blackmailed or threatened you

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,200
with abduction or kidnapping?

103
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,700
That's not the case either.

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
   

105
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Open up.

106
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Seeing how you got me my medicine,

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
you must have no intention of letting me go.

108
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Jaehyo,

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,600
are you really going to keep going with this?

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,100
Let me ask this one thing.

111
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
Why are you doing this?

112
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
You must have some sort of a reason.

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,700
We need money.

114
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
How much?

115
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,700
Half a billion won.

116
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
You asked my mom for 500 million won?

117
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
A billion, to be exact.

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,400
We'll split it in half.

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
You two punks have absolutely lost it.

120
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Hey.

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Why do you need that sort of money?

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
What's it for?

123
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
I can't tell you that.

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,100
All I can tell you is that he and I have—

125
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
I gambled before I was drafted.

126
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
I gambled before I was drafted.

127
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,500
And he's about to be expelled.

128
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,700
- I'm really sorry, Minwoo. 
 - Forget it. Fuck. Don't apologize.

129
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
What good will it do now?

130
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
What's your plan?

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Will you two really get my mom to pay up?

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,900
Yes.

133
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,800
You're seriously unhinged.

134
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
No, it's just that we're desperate.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Bullshit. Do all desperate people turn to crime like this?

136
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,100
Don't rationalize your actions. This is just who you are.

137
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,300
Anyhow.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,200
When you get the money...

139
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
you'll let me go. Right?

140
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,404
What's this? Why aren't you answering me?

141
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
What the heck is this?

142
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,400
Are you thinking of doing me in?

143
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
No, we wouldn't do something like that.

144
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,900
Absolutely not.

145
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,200
We just need your word.

146
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
We just need your word.

147
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
Promise us that you'll let this slide.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Promise us that you'll let this slide.

149
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,264
That's it?

150
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,600
All right. If you let me go after you get your money,

151
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll let it all slide.

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,400
I mean it. I won't even say or do anything until then.

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
That's what you want. Right?

154
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
That's right.

155
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,600
Okay. That's a deal.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Let me use the bathroom first.

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
And get me some food, too.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
You want some food?

159
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,400
What? You have to feed me, don't you?

160
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,600
You've asked for a billion won.

161
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,900
That's the least you can do.

162
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Mr. Cho.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

164
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,000
I had a terrible time finding a parking spot.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm really sorry.

166
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,100
- Any luck on his call logs? 
 - About that...

167
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,200
I looked into it, but there wasn't anything.

168
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
All he had were spam and telemarketing calls.

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,700
Other than that, it was just his mom.

170
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,500
What about the local merchants association?

171
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,700
Right.

172
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,900
The local gangs are running the association.

173
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,200
It might cause us some trouble.

174
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,400
This is their turf, you see.

175
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,570
Let's go.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Mr. Cho.

177
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Our men just arrived now.

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,100
Should I go get them?

179
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:11,589
I'll be back in a flash.

180
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,382
First floor.

181
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,400
"Youth Baseball Federation."

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,000
"Assistant Manager Cho Yongho."

183
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
Hold on.

184
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
You guys run a sports betting ring.

185
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,200
What brings you here?

186
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Do you want to launder some money?

187
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,300
We don't do that here.

188
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm looking for a shop.

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,700
What shop?

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
The shop this man visited two days ago around 6:00 p.m.

191
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,600
The shop this man visited two days ago around 6:00 p.m.

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,200
It could be a pub or a restaurant,

193
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,800
but it's most likely a pub.

194
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
He's in his early twenties,

195
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
and he probably had company—

196
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
Hold on.

197
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,800
Are you saying you want us to find someone?

198
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Are you saying you want us to find someone?

199
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
Look here.

200
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,800
Do you have any idea how many shops are in this area?

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,600
The merchants must have a network of sorts.

202
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
Something like a group chat.

203
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
I get it.

204
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,900
You want me to upload his picture there?

205
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,400
Why would I?

206
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,100
I'll pay you.

207
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,600
My goodness.

208
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Listen.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,700
I don't know how much you earn through your sports betting ring...

210
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,030
but you should be more careful.

211
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:47,668
   

212
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,800
I will pay you.

213
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,878
This is the last time I'm going to ask you.

214
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,400
What?

215
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,900
"The last time"?

216
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Guys. Lock the door.

217
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,500
Guys. Lock the door.

218
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,900
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,900
Where did he go?

220
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,400
You darned bastard!

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
I knew this would happen.

222
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,500
That way. Let's hurry.

223
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Run!

224
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:35,132
What the hell?

225
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,820
Uh-oh!

226
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,100
My knee!

227
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,700
I'm going home.

228
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll be back soon.

229
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
- What for? 
 - I need to get changed

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,100
and check on my place, too.

231
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

232
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,215
How did you know?

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Know what?

234
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,600
That I was about to be expelled.

235
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,800
How did you know that?

236
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
I followed you.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
You were acting fishy, so I followed you.

238
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
Happy?

239
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,347
Then you must understand how badly I need the money...

240
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,450
don't you?

241
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,000
We still haven't decided what to do with him.

242
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,700
Junseong.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Do you think this problem will go away if you keep putting it off?

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,700
And what if I don't?

245
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,700
We're out of options now.

246
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,600
What do you mean?

247
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,400
We have to kill him.

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
What?

249
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Junseong.

250
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
There's a sedative that's called amobarbital.

251
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
I can get it from the university hospital—

252
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,000
What are you even saying?

253
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
It won't be painful.

254
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,400
I'll do it.

255
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Hey, Jaehyo.

256
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Come on.

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
This is Minwoo we're talking about.

258
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,600
The same Minwoo who drank with us just two nights ago.

259
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Yes. I know that.

260
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
If you did, you wouldn't be saying this.

261
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Do you really believe

262
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
what he said about letting it slide if we set him free

263
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
after getting the money?

264
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,000
"All right. Thanks."

265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,600
"Here is half a billion for each of you."

266
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,800
"You let me live, after all."

267
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,200
"Enjoy your new lives with that money."

268
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Do you seriously believe him?

269
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,100
Hey.

270
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,200
What do you take him for?

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,100
What do you mean?

272
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
Answer me.

273
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,900
What do you take him for?

274
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
A hostage.

275
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,400
No, Jaehyo. You're wrong!

276
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,100
He may be a hostage now, but he was our friend first.

277
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
That's why we can't do it. No way.

278
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
Fuck. Then what do you expect me to do?

279
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,800
I have absolutely no idea!

280
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,800
For fuck's sake...

281
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,700
Jaehyo.

282
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Get him something to eat.

283
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,400
Make sure to feed him and call me if anything happens.

284
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Make sure to feed him and call me if anything happens.

285
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm off.

286
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:48,485
   

287
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
He must have left somehow.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Through where?

289
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,000
You said you took a look inside.

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Exactly.

291
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,700
I clearly remember seeing just two men there.

292
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Suan,

293
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,500
as you know, we get noise complaints five to six times a day.

294
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,300
We had to respond to about 20 such cases just last night.

295
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,200
And yet, I remember what happened that night clearly.

296
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Do you know why?

297
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,800
Because I fired my taser.

298
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,300
There were definitely just two of them.

299
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,200
I've heard that my partner told you the same thing.

300
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,500
But there are clearly three men in the video.

301
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,400
I'm sorry,

302
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
but if you want to report it, bring me some concrete evidence.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,700
but if you want to report it, bring me some concrete evidence.

304
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,800
All you have now is speculation.

305
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,000
It's more than that. This is a reasonable doubt.

306
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Gosh.

307
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Bring me solid proof.

308
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Get going.

309
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,600
Officer Kang Seongmin of Namseo Police Station speaking.

310
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
How may I help you?

311
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
- Yes. 
 - Unbelievable.

312
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,929
 Welcome. 

313
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
It's so hot.

314
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
It's so hot.

315
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
My fingers almost got cooked.

316
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,137
By the way, I do understand why he said that.

317
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:16,331
By the way, I do understand why he said that.

318
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,911
Think about it. He can't just file a report based on our word.

319
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:23,980
They can't make any moves without any evidence.

320
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,484
Do you need a bag?

321
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:31,755
Here.

322
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,507
Maybe this isn't the place.

323
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:06,147
He came back around 12:35 a.m.,

324
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,026
so let's check the video from 12:10 a.m.

325
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,119
Stop. There he is.

326
00:21:14,465 --> 00:21:17,767
- Gosh. 
 - They should have had a camera there.

327
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,930
That's the stationery section.

328
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,683
He bought ten rolls of green tape, nine rolls of duct tape,

329
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,310
and all the cable ties we had.

330
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,506
I remember because he stormed in and took everything on the shelf.

331
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,633
We never get customers like that.

332
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,026
That aside, is this really for an official investigation?

333
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,136
That aside, is this really for an official investigation?

334
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:39,322
Of course.

335
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,060
Cheol, your mother has the master key. Right?

336
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,645
Cheol, your mother has the master key. Right?

337
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,780
Cheol, your mother has the master key. Right?

338
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,677
   

339
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:56,573
We received a report.

340
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:00,953
   

341
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,879
I think I know where he went.

342
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,809
 How are things going? 

343
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,644
It's smooth sailing so far.

344
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,838
I've figured out where he was abducted.

345
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:12,147
I think I'll be able to find him soon.

346
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,633
 That's not the point. I'm asking about his mother. 

347
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:19,321
His mother, sir?

348
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,098
 You're so slow. 

349
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,808
 Listen closely. 

350
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,912
 I didn't put you up to this just so you can find her kid. 

351
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,165
 Your assignment is to keep an eye on the mother. 

352
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,250
Understood, sir.

353
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,253
 That kid doesn't matter to us. 

354
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,780
 What matters is his mother. 

355
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,082
 That crazy cow. 

356
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,936
   

357
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:57,860
The place doesn't have any security cameras,

358
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,804
and they seem to have used cash.

359
00:23:00,804 --> 00:23:02,615
Also, just as you suggested, the three of them seemed to be friends.

360
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,350
Also, just as you suggested, the three of them seemed to be friends.

361
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,768
They were around the same age.

362
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:07,144
He doesn't know where they went?

363
00:23:07,144 --> 00:23:09,455
No, the owner doesn't know where they went,

364
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:12,566
but one of them was wearing a varsity jacket.

365
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:15,644
- I see. 
 - It apparently said Sungjin University.

366
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:17,613
So?

367
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,332
Shall we comb the campus?

368
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,777
   

369
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,844
Mr. Lee Junseong.

370
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,795
You pricks!

371
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,089
Wait. I might really fall.

372
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,616
Shit. I'll pay you.

373
00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:04,359
You idiot.

374
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,846
I let you go so you could get my money.

375
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,291
Where the hell were you?

376
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,517
Do you think this is a joke?

377
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,060
No, I don't.

378
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,561
Be honest.

379
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:16,438
You were trying to run. Right?

380
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,716
Did you come to get your stuff?

381
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:19,216
No, I wasn't.

382
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,093
I swear.

383
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,627
Then what?

384
00:24:23,988 --> 00:24:27,682
Where were you yesterday and the day before?

385
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,869
Spill it.

386
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,496
Wait.

387
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,607
I was at my dad's restaurant.

388
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,125
That's a load of bullshit.

389
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,985
I ought to just...

390
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,495
Guys, throw him over.

391
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,150
Wait. Just a second.

392
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,615
What are you guys doing?

393
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,254
He must have lost it.

394
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:58,714
I'll pay you back.

395
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,858
I'm going to pay you back, you bastards!

396
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,753
- Stop it! 
 - Hey.

397
00:25:07,197 --> 00:25:08,057
Hey.

398
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:10,000
Damn it.

399
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,008
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

400
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:15,122
You don't have to pay me back.

401
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:18,591
It's easier to just cripple you and harvest your organs.

402
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:21,211
 When you get the money, you'll let me go. Right? 

403
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,588
 When you get the money, you'll let me go. Right? 

404
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,014
 If you let me go after you get your money, 

405
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,324
 I'll let it all slide. 

406
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,869
 You just want me to keep still until you get your money. Right? 

407
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:30,246
 I'll do that. 

408
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:31,263
 That's right. 

409
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,906
 Okay. That's a deal. 

410
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,284
I'm telling you the truth.

411
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,605
I'll make big money in a few days!

412
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,222
"Big money"?

413
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,859
What money?

414
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,403
Who's going to give you money?

415
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:48,555
What idiot would do that?

416
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,846
Never mind.

417
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,604
Enjoying your meal?

418
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,791
Sure.

419
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,946
I need to ask you something.

420
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:42,376
When you promised us you'd let it slide,

421
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:44,110
did you mean it?

422
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:47,840
What's wrong? You don't trust me?

423
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,510
I do.

424
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,886
I trust you.

425
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,177
I sure do.

426
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,137
Why wouldn't I?

427
00:26:55,973 --> 00:26:57,741
Why did you ask, then?

428
00:26:58,392 --> 00:26:59,826
Just because.

429
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,337
I was curious.

430
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,125
Dig in.

431
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,681
Isn't there any more?

432
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,616
You should've cooked two portions, not one.

433
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:16,227
That was all I had.

434
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:17,911
Get me some rice, then.

435
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:19,648
I don't have any, cooked or uncooked.

436
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:23,660
How can you not? Then give me some more of the soup.

437
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,141
Thank goodness it wasn't a stir-fry noodle.

438
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,502
You son of a bitch!

439
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:38,484
What now, you bastard?

440
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,811
- Come here, fuck. 
 - Let me go, you bastard!

441
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,413
Let go, you prick!

442
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,447
Let me go!

443
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,376
Damn it.

444
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,377
You bastard...

445
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,841
Come get some!

446
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,801
He must have lost it.

447
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,821
Stop!

448
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,840
   

449
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,734
 Judging from the camera footage, one of them seems to have gone out. 

450
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:06,003
 Judging from the camera footage, one of them seems to have gone out. 

451
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:08,522
 But I think that medical student is still inside. 

452
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:12,943
Hey, open up.

453
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,945
Open up the fucking door!

454
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:16,446
 Hey, Park Minwoo! 

455
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:22,061
 Hey, Park Minwoo, you're not going to open it? 

456
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,787
No?

457
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,051
 - Open the door.  
 - This place is a dump.

458
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,086
 Open up, you prick! 

459
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,714
Fuck!

460
00:29:33,714 --> 00:29:36,450
Just wait until I get my hands on you.

461
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,318
Fucking bastard!

462
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,858
Gosh.

463
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,194
Park Minwoo, just wait, you bastard!

464
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,480
Park Minwoo, just wait, you bastard!

465
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,670
You'll let me go after you get the money?

466
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,714
Bullshit. Do they think I'm a pushover?

467
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,080
Come on, you bastard!

468
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:58,692
You never should have messed with me.

469
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:01,361
Jaehyo...

470
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,533
What's gotten into you?

471
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:09,778
This isn't who you are.

472
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:14,182
You carried me on your back...

473
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:18,270
and even took me to the school nurse.

474
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,322
 Are you okay, Minwoo? 

475
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,107
 - Minwoo. 
 - Wake up! 

476
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:28,154
You saved my life.

477
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,831
That wasn't me, you fucker.

478
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,680
   

479
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,594
   

480
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:31,671
What's all this?

481
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,077
   
   

482
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,871
Hold still.

483
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,038
   

484
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:40,882
Damn it! Just hold still!

485
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:00,702
Damn it.

486
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,691
Hey!

487
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,484
Hey!

488
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:09,962
You son of a bitch!

489
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:12,097
What do you think you're doing?

490
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:19,246
Look at this.

491
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:21,749
He did this to me.

492
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:23,109
What?

493
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,451
Minwoo did that?

494
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,545
- That's right. 
 - I didn't.

495
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:29,523
I'll keep him alive like you said, so don't stop me.

496
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:30,524
Wait, Jaehyo!

497
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:31,926
- Wait! 
 - Junseong!

498
00:37:31,926 --> 00:37:34,178
- He's going to kill me! Help! 
 - Let go, you punk!

499
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:36,038
- Let go! 
  - Fuck! 

500
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:37,181
Damn it.

501
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:39,658
 - He'll kill me!  
 - They're insane.

502
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:40,951
 Stop, Jaehyo! 

503
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:43,120
 Please! 

504

Half a billion is chump change.

Hey, you two.

You need money. Right?
