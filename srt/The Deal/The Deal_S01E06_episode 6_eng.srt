1
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,981
Stop! There seems to be a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,881
I've done nothing wrong. Those punks—

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,014
Me neither!

4
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,147
Those assholes dragged me here. I swear!

5
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:18,014
Shit, what do we do now?

6
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:20,014
Get down on the ground.

7
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,514
Get down!

8
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,381
We're not with them.

9
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:27,314
No. You have to believe us, sir.

10
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:32,381
Why did you shoot at me?

11
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,114
Jaehyo, it's not this.

12
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,647
Open your mouths and you're dead.

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,047
Hello?

14
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:52,514
Hey, it's me. Some rats came into the laundry place.

15
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:55,181
 Now? Are they our guys? 

16
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,414
No, they're just a bunch of kids.

17
00:00:57,414 --> 00:01:01,647
One of them came by the other day. They're amateurs.

18
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,681
 Check the safe first. 

19
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,314
Okay. Bye.

20
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:29,481
Fuck! Why make this harder than it already is?

21
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:30,614
Just shut up!

22
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:34,014
Why? We're all going to die anyway.

23
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,081
I don't see him.

24
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,114
How am I supposed to do this with my hands tied like this?

25
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:55,747
I said you're dead if you open your mouth.

26
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,914
Please save me.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,790
   

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,680
   

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,370
   

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,890
   

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,980


32
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:04,831
   

33
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,281
Which is it?

34
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:42,214
So my son was locked up in here like this?

35
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:44,814
Yes, it seems so.

36
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,347
 Ma'am. 

37
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:51,347
I think you should see this right away.

38
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,181
Why are you looking at me like that?

39
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,981
Are you all thinking that my son is in there?

40
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,481
Why can't you answer?

41
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:29,147
But you know what? I think differently.

42
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:34,814
Until I see his body with my own eyes, my son is not dead.

43
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:40,814
Don't just stand there. Go out and find him right now.

44
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,947
Yes, Ma'am.

45
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:47,481
I gave you three days. So you have only one day left. Right?

46
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:49,014
Yes.

47
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:09,881
Talk.

48
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,314
 I've reported it to the higher-ups. They're sending some men. 

49
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,447
And the rats?

50
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,314
 Kill them. 

51
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,914
Kill them?

52
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:23,381
 They said they'll take care of the bodies. 

53
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,747
Okay. Thanks.

54
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:31,814
Sir, I really didn't do anything wrong!

55
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,214
You have to believe me! Please!

56
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,314
Argh! Sir, sir, please!

57
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:38,181
I'll do whatever you say, sir.

58
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:41,314
So please, spare me. Please!

59
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:44,281
Please, sir. Please don't kill me.

60
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,481
19990718.

61
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,081
July 18, 1999, my birthday!

62
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,614
It's the combination for the safe!

63
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,247
The owner of the safe is my dad.

64
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:12,731
My name is Park Minwoo. Dad's name is Park Woonam, Mom's name is Ra Hyejeong.

65
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:18,347
WN Partners is our family's company!

66
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:19,847
Is that true?

67
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,747
Yes, it is.

68
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,755
Why aren't you helping?

69
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,290
Hey!

70
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,639
Hey! Go!

71
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,147
Hey! Park Minwoo!

72
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,398
Hey...

73
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,664
Hey, stop it.

74
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:10,498
Hey, stop.

75
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:14,698
I told you to fucking stop!

76
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,431
Let's get out of here. Come on, quick.

77
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,398
Hey, get off me.

78
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,531
Get off me.

79
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,381
What's this?

80
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,347
What happened?

81
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:56,281
I don't know.

82
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,381
Jaehyo, let's get out of here. Come on.

83
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:00,647
Let's go.

84
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,914
Jaehyo. Hey!

85
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:29,541
No, don't.

86
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,531
Don't move. Please.

87
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,964
Jaehyo!

88
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:40,031
Move.

89
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:43,898
Jaehyo, what should we do? She won't die, will she?

90
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:47,131
Shut the fuck up!

91
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,631
Jaehyo, what do we do?

92
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,164
Oh no.

93
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:55,098
You press down firmly here.

94
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,831
Hang in there.

95
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,047
Come on!

96
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,747
Hurry up and do something.

97
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:22,947
Quick. Do something. You have to help her.

98
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,181
Okay. Hang in there.

99
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:34,581
You have to hang in there. Please...

100
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,581
Hey.

101
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,481
Hey.

102
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,514
Hey.

103
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,847
Jaehyo.

104
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,669
Jaehyo.

105
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,814
This can't be...

106
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:27,581
It's all fucked up.

107
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,847
It's over.

108
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:16,314
This isn't our money!

109
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,281
Get out of the way!

110
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,514
Get lost, you fucking bastard!

111
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,947
No, you can't touch the money in here!

112
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,947
Fucking get out of the way!

113
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,414
Get in.

114
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,281
Get the fuck in!

115
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,727
Lee Junseong! Lee Junseong!

116
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:53,981
Junseong, we have to go now.

117
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:58,281
We have to go!

118
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,181
Get in.

119
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:49,914
I haven't given up on Minwoo yet.

120
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:54,681
So do whatever it takes to find him.

121
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,014
Yes, Ma'am.

122
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:59,447
You may not have kids, but you have parents.

123
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,947
You know what I mean. Right?

124
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:09,181
I don't have parents. I don't even know them.

125
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,247
I'll do the best I can.

126
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,281
I made all that up.

127
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:29,714
I didn't know there was money in there. I lied to save my ass.

128
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,081
I'm sorry about that. My bad.

129
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:34,714
But you can't touch that money.

130
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:38,547
It belongs to some really scary people, and if you get caught...

131
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,914
your family won't be safe either.

132
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:44,414
Family?

133
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,947
- Then you should've fucking stopped him! 
 - You think I didn't try?

134
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:52,181
What could I do when he was going batshit insane?

135
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,714
Shut the fuck up, both of you!

136
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,847
If we're going to get killed whether we take the money or not,

137
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:01,481
we should take it, shouldn't we?

138
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,581
What the fuck are you doing!?

139
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,547
Give me the phone. I have to call my mom.

140
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:22,914
- Don't. 
 - Give it!

141
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,381
- Don't. 
 - Give it!

142
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,681
I said don't! Fuck!

143
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,514
Junseong.

144
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,614
Please give me the phone.

145
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,947
My mom could be in danger because of me.

146
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,514
Please, I'm begging you. Give me the phone.

147
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:56,114
Please, Junseong. Huh?

148
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,614
I've got us a room, so let's go now.

149
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,881
You turned your phone off. Right?

150
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,614
Give me your phone.

151
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:10,214
Give it to me!

152
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:16,581
No, Junseong. I need it.

153
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,614
- Where's your phone? 
 - Just leave me alone.

154
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:22,481
For Pete's sake, get your shit together!

155
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,947
Both of you, get out.

156
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,547
Hello, sir.

157
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,847
This way.

158
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:58,981
It's a woman. The cause of deathis excessive bleeding.

159
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:02,481
I'm guessing she was shot by the caretaker while running away.

160
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:06,281
She was shot here and bled out.

161
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:07,814
ID?

162
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,747
Nothing particular. Just run-of-the-mill.

163
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:14,581
- But do you know what's odd? 
 - What?

164
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:17,314
I found her ID in her wallet.

165
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:21,281
According to her address, she lives right next door...

166
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,847
next door to Song Jaehyo.

167
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:29,747
It's a strange coincidence.

168
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:35,447
So you're saying she was an accomplice to Park Minwoo's kidnapping?

169
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,414
And she did it for the money?

170
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:41,181
Yes, it appears so.

171
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,914
No CCTV cameras?

172
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,481
Nope, we didn't let them install any.

173
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,514
Get the guys to search the entire area.

174
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:51,181
Check personal CCTVs and dashcams. Do whatever it takes.

175
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,847
Find them by tonight. Got it?

176
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,847
Got it.

177
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,381
What is that?

178
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,614
Park Minwoo.

179
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:25,447
Tell us everything you know about those guys.

180
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:36,547
In our house, we called him Director.

181
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:38,814
Director Hwang.

182
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:41,381
His assets are in the trillions.

183
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:44,947
He is loaded with money.

184
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:48,114
But it's not just a cartel with a ton of money.

185
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,814
These people kill without batting an eye.

186
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:56,814
If we get caught, we're all just dead.

187
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:59,247
Our families, too.

188
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,881
This could be for the better.

189
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,514
What?

190
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:21,614
As you said, we've all become accomplices.

191
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,581
Hear me out.

192
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:29,881
We're heading south to a remote area.

193
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:32,914
We'll keep going south and not come back to Seoul.

194
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:37,281
We'll lie low until things die down, then come back to Seoul.

195
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,981
The money will be split equally among the three of us.

196
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:43,147
You've really gone crazy. You want to take me, too?

197
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:44,581
Of course.

198
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:48,747
So you can't go to the police or tell your mom.

199
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,481
Hey, we can do this.

200
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:57,747
The money we've got here is at least 20 billion won.

201
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:01,814
You really think those thugs won't find us?

202
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:12,381
You... Did you take the dead woman's phone?

203
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:16,414
No?

204
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:19,447
She followed us.

205
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:25,247
She filmed us with her phone. You think this will die down?

206
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,281
What should we do then?

207
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:33,481
You want us to give up the money because of a dead woman, huh?

208
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:36,614
Haven't things turned out the way you wanted?

209
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:40,781
Minwoo can't report us, we don't have to kill him, and we're loaded now.

210
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,581
Didn't it all work out just fine?

211
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,781
You fucking bastard!

212
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,847
Two people are dead!

213
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:51,114
One was self-defense, and the other, we didn't kill!

214
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:54,147
So why are you flipping out on me?

215
00:22:56,581 --> 00:22:58,581
You fucking asshole.

216
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:04,347
If you're so desperate, do something instead of just sitting around.

217
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,047
You need the money just as bad!

218
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:57,014
I hope you feel to your bones the price you must pay for embezzling funds.

219
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:58,447
Believe me! It won't happen again, sir.

220
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,847
- Turn it on. 
 - Sir.

221
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,281
Director! Please, spare me!

222
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:06,847
Please forgive me, Director! Please!

223
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:09,547
Faster!

224
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:11,547
Faster!

225
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:26,581
So, the kid is alive?

226
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,114
Yes.

227
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:29,714
That's good news.

228
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:32,747
But we have a problem.

229
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,447
What is it?

230
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:36,081
Our laundry was raided.

231
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:40,647
We think it was the kidnappers and Park Minwoo.

232
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,681
So you're saying.

233
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:50,214
Park Minwoo's mom staged the whole incident?

234
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:54,147
She was playing me from the start, huh?

235
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:58,381
No, sir. I think she was fooled, too.

236
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:02,481
By who? By her own son?

237
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:08,514
So you came here to defend her?

238
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:14,514
Tell me exactly. Was she fooled or do you think she was fooled?

239
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,914
She was fooled.

240
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:30,281
You know what happens to anyone who touches that money. Right?

241
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:35,281
You also know that whether she was fooled or not is beside the point.

242
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:39,981
I want her here by tomorrow morning. I'll speak to her face to face.

243
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,347
I will call her.

244
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:45,247
No. You bring her here.

245
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,547
By dawn.

246
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:53,881
 There has been a string of unfortunate incidents in which 

247
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,614
 financial problems drove people to make extreme choices. 

248
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,781
 On the 23rd, 

249
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:02,847
 a mother and daughter were found dead in Seoul, 

250
00:27:02,847 --> 00:27:06,314
 while the day before yesterday, in Incheon, two teenage brothers 

251
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:08,947
 were found dead and their parents unconscious. 

252
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:11,547
 Han Dongho has the story. 

253
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:14,847
Go ahead.

254
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:40,581
You go first.

255
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:46,781
Don't try anything stupid.

256
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,714
Nothing yet.

257
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,481
What?

258
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,814
If those thugs disposed of the bodies,

259
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:23,514
they wouldn't need to call the cops.

260
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,714
Anyway, nothing on the news yet.

261
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,981
Hey.

262
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:56,947
What do you think we should do with him?

263
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,914
What?

264
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:01,014
I mean...

265
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,347
I have a feeling he could be trouble for us.

266
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:06,981
What trouble?

267
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,481
I just...

268
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:12,714
I just think he'll backstab us.

269
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:15,181
You just said he's our accomplice.

270
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:18,081
I know. I did.

271
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,114
But do you really think he can be trusted?

272
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:29,647
What I'm saying is that we should keep a closer watch on him.

273
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:30,982
Buzz off.

274
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:33,314
Junseong.

275
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:38,414
I'm done. It's all yours.

276
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:43,247
Keep a close eye on him.

277
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:17,714
Come home with me to my mom.

278
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:21,247
Then I'll give you all the money.

279
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,481
What?

280
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:29,047
Those people are really scary, but my mom will be able to protect us.

281
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:31,181
I give you my word.

282
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:33,047
Piss off.

283
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:36,781
Junseong, please.

284
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:40,881
I don't want to die like this. You have to help me. I'm begging you.

285
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,414
Just fuck off!

286
00:30:42,414 --> 00:30:46,014
You can fucking take it all, the 20 billion!

287
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,181
Think carefully.

288
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:57,381
You can save your dad, I can save my mom.

289
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:00,281
Our families' lives are at stake.

290
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:04,281
Don't act like a fool. Okay?

291
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:22,647
Ma'am?

292
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,847
They sent a text.

293
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:30,247
It appears they aren't able to trace Song Jaehyo and Lee Junseong's phones.

294
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:56,747
Ma'am! Ma'am!

295
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,134
Fucking asshole.

296
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,581
Come on.

297
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:11,447
   

298
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:17,514
   

299
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:38,170
   

300
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,810
 The number you have dialed... 

301
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,214
Her phone is off?

302
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:46,747
 Son, are you here? 

303
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,481
There was a ruckus in the semi-basement last night.

304
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,914
That med student must have borrowed money or be in deep trouble.

305
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:56,681
A bunch of thugs broke in and...

306
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:57,881
And what?

307
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:00,225
And ransacked his house.

308
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:04,314
If anyone asks, pretend not to know.

309
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:07,347
They did pay generously for the door repair,

310
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,547
but if word gets out—

311
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,381
Hey! Where are you going?

312
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:24,647
Honey! Honey!

313
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:40,347
   

314
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,381
Yes, brother?

315
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,581
 Where are you now? 

316
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:50,281
I'm at Suan's, but she's not here.

317
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,747
Seems she didn't come home last night.

318
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,914
 What happened to Suan? 

319
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,947
What do you mean?

320
00:36:59,947 --> 00:37:01,647
Don't you know?

321
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:04,170
Why? What's going on?

322
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,440
 Did something happen to her? 

323
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:11,047
Suan...

324
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:16,381
Suan... What about Suan? Why?

325
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:23,181
Suan is dead.

326
00:37:31,014 --> 00:37:33,414
 Early this morning, a woman in her 20s 

327
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:37,081
 was found dead on a hill in Inje, Gangwon Province. 

328
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:41,814
 The police said they received a report from a hiker and found 

329
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:46,947
 the body of the woman presumed to be in her 20s. 

330
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:50,214
 The body shows no sign of decomposition, 

331
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,914
 suggesting the death occurred not long ago. 

332
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:58,281
 The police think that the victim was shot accidentally while passing through 

333
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:02,174
 the secluded hunting area at night and are conducting an investigation. 

334
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:08,252
   

335
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:20,990
