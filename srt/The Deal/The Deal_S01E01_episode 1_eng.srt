1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,415
How does it feel to be out of the army?

2
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:07,882
Have you matured at all?

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,508
It's the same.

4
00:00:10,336 --> 00:00:11,529
Where's Taeyeong?

5
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:12,921
He said he couldn't make it.

6
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:15,716
Will it be just the two of us drinking, then?

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,059
Someone else is joining us.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,510
Who is it?

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,720
Park Minwoo.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,972
He was in our class back in tenth grade.

11
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,557
You know, the rich guy.

12
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,268
I remember him. That rich punk.

13
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:28,187
Since when were you two close?

14
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:30,147
We're not.

15
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,815
He's almost there.

16
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,733
Let's go.

17
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:37,696
- You punk— 
 - That depends on the situation.

18
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,198
- I'm serious— 
 - Jaehyo!

19
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:41,875
- But those are identical— 
 - I'm right, you know.

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,561
Sorry, I'm late.

21
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,855
Don't be. We just got here, too.

22
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:49,166
Fancy seeing you here, Junseong. It's been a while.

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,210
You remember me? It's been ages.

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,845
Are you joining the military, too?

25
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,798
What's so funny?

26
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,325
Are you trying to pick a fight with me? I was discharged yesterday.

27
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,119
You were discharged yesterday?

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,595
I had no idea. Sorry.

29
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,765
You might as well go again. Enlist with Taeyeong.

30
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,926
You're just saying anything since you'll be a military doctor.

31
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,838
Military doctors have to serve 36 months.

32
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,525
- But you have it easy. 
 - How long are we going to be drinking?

33
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,926
Why? Do you have a problem?

34
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,153
No, I wouldn't say that.

35
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:21,724
I just need to get home by midnight.

36
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:22,892
What?

37
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:25,369
Aren't you too old to have a curfew?

38
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,687
Is this a rich family thing?

39
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,847
- No, I'm not rich— 
 - Hey.

40
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,024
It's fine. Forget it.

41
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,251
We'll get you a taxi if we run late.

42
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,128
Don't make such a fuss.

43
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,588
It's freezing. Let's go inside.

44
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,382
Can you hold your liquor, Minwoo?

45
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,575
Don't tell me you're going to black out.

46
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,977
I actually love to drink. I also drink quite often.

47
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,270
Let's go.

48
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,306
It's so cold.

49
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,933
- Gosh, it's cold. 
 - Let's get going.

50
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,810
I'd love some gopchang and soju. 
 (Gopchang: small intestines of cattle

51
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,520
That sounds delicious.

52
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,800
   

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,770
   

54
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,550
   

55
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,690
   

56
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:20,100
credit

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,737
   

58
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,816
Hey.

59
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,812
- Get up. 
 - What's wrong?

60
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:09,024
He's awake.

61
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,891
Darn it.

62
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,125
   

63
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,040
   

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,059
    
 Jeez.

65
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,680
I knew it.

66
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,314
- He didn't even drink that much. 
 - Hey.

67
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,017
That much was a lethal dosage for him.

68
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,268
I suppose.

69
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,521
He doesn't know how to enjoy soju.

70
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,398
He must have his own problems, too.

71
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,026
Problems, my ass.

72
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,129
I heard his dad passed away a few years back.

73
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,958
He just lives with his mother now.

74
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,705
Tell me.

75
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,808
What's your plan for the future?

76
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:46,171
Are you going to keep working at your dad's restaurant?

77
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,672
Hey.

78
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,010
Do you know why I enlisted early?

79
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,886
Wasn't it because of sports betting?

80
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,471
Damn it.

81
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,526
When I was 20,

82
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:04,256
this guy at my part-time job was always watching something.

83
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:06,942
So I asked him what it was,

84
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,736
and he said he was making money.

85
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,155
- Let me see. 
 - He said it was simple

86
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:13,741
and that I only had to guess the winner correctly.

87
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,076
So I tried it right away.

88
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,536
Holy shit.

89
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,647
And he was right.

90
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,766
No way!

91
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:23,901
   

92
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,920
Eventually, I lost everything and decided to quit at one point,

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,464
but that's when he told me

94
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,741
he knew of a game where he was sure we'd never lose.

95
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,468
So...

96
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,662
I gave him all my money for that bet.

97
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,629
What money?

98
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,325
I took out a loan.

99
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:45,272
But that bastard stopped showing up to work the next day.

100
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,232
Jeez.

101
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,443
I took out a private loan and gambled daily to pay back that loan,

102
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,844
I took out a private loan and gambled daily to pay back that loan,

103
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,305
but I ended up owing tens of millions of won in no time.

104
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,135
I couldn't stop.

105
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:01,438
Still, didn't your dad pay it all back?

106
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:03,932
Still, didn't your dad pay it all back?

107
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:07,044
 - Darn it! Let me go! 
 - Hold still. 

108
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:09,129
 - Here we go. 
 - Hold him. 

109
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,592
 Did you think I'd just let you go if you ran off to the army 

110
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:17,003
 - with my precious money, you prick? 
 - Shit! 

111
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,458
 Four hundred million won? 

112
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,227
 Hold on. 

113
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,571
 I never borrowed that much from you. 

114
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,632
 But time has passed since then. 

115
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,817
 You know what? 

116
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,735
 - What are you doing? 
 - I gave you a huge discount. 

117
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,696
 - Stop moving, you punk! 
 - What are you doing? 

118
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:36,573
 Junseong. 

119
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:37,841
 Fuck. 

120
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,909
 Please don't kill me, sir. 

121
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,246
 I'll pay you back. 

122
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,389
 - I'll give you your money! 
 - Goodnight. 

123
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:52,147
Let's just go home.

124
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:58,695
What are you doing?

125
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,058
Here it is.

126
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,923
Do they teach you things like that in med school?

127
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,191
I'm short on cash these days.

128
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,986
He won't remember a thing anyway since he's drunk.

129
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,670
You crazy bastard.

130
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,557
We're almost there.

131
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:19,792
Watch out for those stairs.

132
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,793
- Careful. 
 - Watch the stairs.

133
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:23,111
- One, two, three. 
 - Watch your step.

134
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,606
Hold him up properly.

135
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,958
- Darn it. 
 - Gosh.

136
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,161
What?

137
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,305
- Great. 
 - Hey.

138
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,883
- It's freezing. 
 - Take off your shoes.

139
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,076
Hey.

140
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:38,760
Damn it.

141
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,591
Hey, take off your jacket first.

142
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,977
Damn it.

143
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,355
Your other arm.

144
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,868
- Gosh. 
 - Here.

145
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,687
How did he get so tall?

146
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,189
Tell me about it. I'm so jealous.

147
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:09,792
And another thing.

148
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,785
He's so boring.

149
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,365
He was never fun to be with. I just hang out with him.

150
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,325
You two weren't close in school though.

151
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,435
- When did you become close friends? 
 - We're not close.

152
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,136
- When did you become close friends? 
 - We're not close.

153
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,890
It's only been a few months since I got back in touch with him.

154
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,001
It's only been a few months since I got back in touch with him.

155
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:31,146
We just started hanging out recently.

156
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,606
- Because he pays for drinks? 
 - Come on. That's not it.

157
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,108
- Because he pays for drinks? 
 - Come on. That's not it.

158
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,551
Drop the act.

159
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,577
- Let's just drink. 
 - Go grab some food. I'm hungry.

160
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,778
- Let's just drink. 
 - Go grab some food. I'm hungry.

161
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,295
They asked me to pay back 400 million won as soon as I got discharged.

162
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,500
What are you on about?

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,819
I thought my dad paid back everything,

164
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,204
but there was still some left.

165
00:09:57,172 --> 00:10:00,868
The interest snowballed over the last 18 months.

166
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,553
That's ridiculous.

167
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:04,622
I know.

168
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:07,041
It doesn't make any sense.

169
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,793
But I have to pay up, or else they'll take my organs.

170
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,204
You know what?

171
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:17,151
I was so determined to make a fresh start after my service.

172
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:19,411
I was so determined to make a fresh start after my service.

173
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:24,349
That's what I promised myself.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,985
But I'm screwed.

175
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,247
I think my life is over.

176
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,024
Tell them to go to hell.

177
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:36,794
Their whole business is illegal, anyway.

178
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,677
Hey.

179
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:49,232
You were a model student and even got into med school.

180
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,319
You can afford to mess up a few times.

181
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:57,306
But as for losers like me,

182
00:10:57,306 --> 00:11:00,368
we're done for after one misstep.

183
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,064
That's just how fucked up the world is.

184
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,350
 Hey. 

185
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,443
 You should hurry and do something, too. 

186
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,020
   

187
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,272
 You were all in on it together... 

188
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,749
 You can't be the only one to get expelled. 

189
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:16,485
   

190
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:20,387
Damn it.

191
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:30,256
What would you know when you're a medical student?

192
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,590
Answer your darned phone.

193
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,480
It's not mine.

194
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:14,100
It must be that idiot's then.

195
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,560
Who is it?

196
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:44,848
Don't tell me he has a girlfriend.

197
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,110
He doesn't.

198
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:51,338
It's his mom.

199
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,598
   

200
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:55,225
I forgot.

201
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:58,128
He said he needed to get home by midnight.

202
00:12:58,128 --> 00:12:59,313
Hey.

203
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,373
Let's get him home in a taxi.

204
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,808
It's freezing.

205
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,823
   

206
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,961
   

207
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,660
   

208
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:30,411
 Hello? 

209
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,372
 Where are you, Minwoo? 

210
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:37,434
 It's late. Why haven't you come home yet? You're making me worried. 

211
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,445
 You didn't even tell me where you were going. 

212
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,023
 Hello? 

213
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,125
 Can't you hear me, Minwoo? 

214
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,820
 Hello? 

215
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,704
Your son...

216
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,732
is with us.

217
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,728
If you want to see him again,

218
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,090
don't contact anyone...

219
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,684
and prepare...

220
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,386
one billion won.

221
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,301
Otherwise, your son will die.

222
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,477
Otherwise, your son will die.

223
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,051
Gosh.

224
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:30,763
Do they have acting classes in med school, too?

225
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:33,790
You almost had me, you know.

226
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,535
What did she say?

227
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:38,103
I don't know.

228
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,772
I hung up on her.

229
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:42,107
What did she say before that?

230
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:45,778
You said that bit about one billion won after you hung up, didn't you?

231
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,546
She asked him where he was...

232
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,157
and said she was worried,

233
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,692
so I gave her an answer.

234
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,262
I told her that we have him with us,

235
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,088
and that his ransom...

236
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,158
is one billion won.

237
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,504
What?

238
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:04,980
What's wrong?

239
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,274
You hung up after telling her that?

240
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,843
Really?

241
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,444
Yes.

242
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,022
You crazy bastard.

243
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,991
Give me that.

244
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,835
Damn it.

245
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,375
Give me his phone.

246
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,360
Why would you pull a prank like that?

247
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,796
I never said it was a prank.

248
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:30,781
What?

249
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:32,591
It wasn't a prank.

250
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:33,868
I mean it.

251
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:35,678
You really want to hold him for ransom?

252
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,178
Yes.

253
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:42,518
Jaehyo, that's a crime, you lunatic.

254
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:45,061
That would be true if the cops got us.

255
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,130
That would be true if the cops got us.

256
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,190
We're not living in the 80s.

257
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,317
If she reports us, they'll find us within a day.

258
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,970
That's what you think.

259
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,406
They can't track us with his phone turned off.

260
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:57,141
Don't give me that crap.

261
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:59,268
What about the security cameras?

262
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,687
There were tons of cars parked in the alley.

263
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,414
That's my point.

264
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:07,350
How would they ever go through all those cameras?

265
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,087
We used cash at the pub

266
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:12,740
and got into a random taxi off the street.

267
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,161
Can you pin down when, how, and why we came to this part of town?

268
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,387
Can you?

269
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:21,165
Unbelievable.

270
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:25,060
If you don't stop this madness, I'll report you myself.

271
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,745
Go ahead.

272
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,486
But you know you'll go down as my accomplice. Right?

273
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:34,553
You carried Minwoo all the way up here voluntarily.

274
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:38,039
You carried Minwoo all the way up here voluntarily.

275
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,352
I won't be the only one they arrest.

276
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:42,828
What's gotten into you?

277
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,488
Do you still not get it?

278
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:48,808
This will get us

279
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,878
half a billion won each, you moron.

280
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,432
- Give me his phone. 
 - I won't.

281
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,917
- Call the cops. 
 - Jaehyo!

282
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,877
Do you want to screw your life up that badly?

283
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,004
This drunk stunt will make you a loser like me.

284
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,606
My life is already over!

285
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,016
If you're screwed, what does that make me?

286
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,283
Never mind.

287
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:25,287
Just decide if you're in or not.

288
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,997
You have five minutes.

289
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,916
Give me the stupid phone.

290
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,418
Hand me that phone, you punk.

291
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,922
Jeez. You idiot...

292
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,856
Fuck!

293
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,595
Screw you.

294
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,505
Damn it.

295
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,394
Let me go, you lunatic!

296
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,070
Hey!

297
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,656
 The phone is turned off. Your call will be directed to voicemail. 

298
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:58,362
 The phone is turned off. Your call will be directed to voicemail. 

299
00:17:58,362 --> 00:17:59,555
You son of a...

300
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:01,615
Damn it!

301
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:07,313
Damn it.

302
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:08,955
Give it here!

303
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:14,052
 The phone is turned off. Your call will be directed to voicemail... 

304
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,845
You fucking asshole!

305
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,413
You prick.

306
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:25,931
Let's say you and I worked ourselves to the bone for a decade.

307
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:28,559
Let's say you and I worked ourselves to the bone for a decade.

308
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,061
We'll never be able to make 500 million won.

309
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,022
But him?

310
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,132
He probably owns buildings that are worth billions.

311
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:39,252
You must be nuts.

312
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,836
I can't believe you.

313
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,546
Damn it.

314
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,577
Junseong,

315
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:15,005
some have it easy

316
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:18,291
just because they were born into a rich family,

317
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:21,648
but for some, our lives are over

318
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:24,531
the moment we're done serving in the military.

319
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,758
That's how things are.

320
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,861
You have five minutes.

321
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,514
Make up your mind.

322
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:58,356
Fuck.

323
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,179
   

324
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,779
   

325
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,088
   

326
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,407
   

327
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:18,426
In this field, he's a renowned expert.

328
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:30,989
Damn it.

329
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,811
You could take either of these two options.

330
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:37,771
You could go to the police

331
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,632
or deal with it privately.

332
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:41,608
Dealing with it privately means complying with their demands.

333
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,427
Dealing with it privately means complying with their demands.

334
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,029
I would recommend the former over the latter.

335
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,722
I would recommend the former over the latter.

336
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:48,198
May I ask why?

337
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:50,993
Even if the ransom is paid without a police report,

338
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,719
most culprits...

339
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,622
end up killing their hostages.

340
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,752
You said the kidnapper said "us" while on the phone. Correct?

341
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,046
You said the kidnapper said "us" while on the phone. Correct?

342
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:23,509
Kidnappers rarely work alone.

343
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:24,635
It's a sure bet that they had this planned as a team.

344
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:27,112
It's a sure bet that they had this planned as a team.

345
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,238
Hey!

346
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,285
Open the darned door, you punk!

347
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,578
 Hey! 

348
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:35,738
 Jaehyo! 

349
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,989
 Open the fucking door. 

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,076
 Open the door! 

351
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,453
 Jaehyo, open up. 

352
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:46,006
 Jaehyo, you bastard! 
   

353
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,024
 Jaehyo, you bastard! 
   

354
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,450
Come on, you moron!

355
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,077
In my opinion, they are highly skilled professionals.

356
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:54,890
In my opinion, they are highly skilled professionals.

357
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,434
They are not to be treated lightly.

358
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:59,019
Come on!

359
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,189
Hey!

360
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,316
You lunatic.

361
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,256
What do you think you're doing?

362
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:08,445
What gives?

363
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:10,814
What's wrong with you?

364
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:42,229
Hello?

365
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:46,233
Hello? I can't see anything.

366
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:47,860
 (Fuck.) 

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,428
 - (What do we do?)  
 - Is anyone there?

368
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:01,248
Help!

369
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:04,200
Somebody help me!

370
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,450
Did you guys tie me up?

371
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,753
If you ever decide to get the police involved,

372
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:51,289
you should contact me first.

373
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:04,770
Ms. Kim.

374
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,270
Yes, ma'am?

375
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:10,083
Contact the Federation immediately.

376
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:30,654
He's breathing.

377
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:32,622
He's just knocked out.

378
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,510
But guess what?

379
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,695
We'll be in trouble...

380
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,918
if he throws up after he wakes up.

381
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:47,053
But it's not that bad right now, so we're good.

382
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,326
Damn it.

383
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,601
Jaehyo.

384
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,686
Let's stop.

385
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,071
You said he's all right.

386
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,023
Let's get him to a hospital,

387
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,207
call his mom, and tell her we were fooling around because we were drunk.

388
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:10,152
call his mom, and tell her we were fooling around because we were drunk.

389
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,613
I bet she'll let it go.

390
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,590
Nothing will happen.

391
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,259
I'll get on my knees and beg her.

392
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,269
Please!

393
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:30,481
 This is the police. 

394
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:32,357
 Please open up. 

395
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,064
Is anyone home?

396
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:52,069
   

397
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,837
Do you own the place?

398
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:58,325
No, I'm just a tenant. What is it?

399
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,035
We received a complaint.

400
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:03,514
Someone reported a loud commotion in this unit.

401
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:05,724
Right. I see.

402
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:08,535
Did you fight with the man behind you?

403
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:11,730
Well, not exactly.

404
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,032
I wouldn't say we fought.

405
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:15,192
We just argued for a moment. But that's over now.

406
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:16,218
We just argued for a moment. But that's over now.

407
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:19,404
Is it just the two of you in there?

408
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:24,759
Let me check the premises for a second.

409
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,980
It'll only take a minute.

410
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,790
Excuse us.

411
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:38,048
It's not just an argument.

412
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,033
You were drinking.

413
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:48,751
- This happened tonight, right? 
 - Yes.

414
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,136
Was it really just an argument?

415
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:54,656
Yes. Of course.

416
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:18,030
How much did you have to drink?

417
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,708
Well, we just had some beer.

418
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,086
Let's see.

419
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,646
You son of a bitch!

420
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:35,397
- Gosh. 
 - There they go again.

421
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:37,249
- Hey! 
 - Step away from him.

422
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,734
 - (Hit me.)  
 - Can't you hear me?

423
00:27:38,734 --> 00:27:40,986
- Knock it off. Okay? 
 - Why you...

424
00:27:40,986 --> 00:27:41,929
Damn you.

425
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,665
- Stop it. 
 - Hey, guys--

426
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,934
- You think you're all that? 
 - Young man. Stop it!

427
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:48,060
Are you okay?

428
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,562
- Stay still! 
 - You pathetic—

429
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,756
- Come here! 
 - Who the hell do you think you are?

430
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,416
- Hey. 
 - Stop. Stay away.

431
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,377
Damn it.

432
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,796
This is your last warning.

433
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,197
Knock it off.

434
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:02,174
I told you to knock it off.

435
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:04,093
I'll shoot!

436
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,777
Don't you hear me?

437
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:16,505
It's so cold. Is the heating broken?

438
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:19,098
It's so cold. Is the heating broken?

439
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,275
What are you doing?

440
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,360
Honey, the cops arrived and went into that unit.

441
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,570
Honey, the cops arrived and went into that unit.

442
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,614
It took them forever to respond.

443
00:28:25,614 --> 00:28:27,449
How typical.

444
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,249
You know what?

445
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:37,267
I hope there's been a murder.

446
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,402
   

447
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:41,071
That'd be a great story for your interview.

448
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:44,800
"I've reported a major crime that happened next door!"

449
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,678
"I'm ready to serve as an officer!"

450
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,640
Interviewers would give you a pass right away.

451
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,976
I bet they just fought while drinking.

452
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:55,884
You said you saw three men going inside.

453
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:58,422
I did.

454
00:28:58,422 --> 00:28:59,815
But then again, it was too loud to be an ordinary fight.

455
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:02,609
But then again, it was too loud to be an ordinary fight.

456
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:03,944
That's true.

457
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:06,504
It didn't sound like a squabble. Right?

458
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:10,742
Here they come.

459
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,193
Honey, the police just came out with two men.

460
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:21,612
Honey, the police just came out with two men.

461
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:23,212
And?

462
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:26,424
- I just can't move... 
 - Get moving!

463
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,836
Both of them are in handcuffs.

464
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,123
What?

465
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,183
   

466
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:41,315
Start off with your personal info.

467
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,384
And then, write down when you started drinking

468
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:47,972
and why you got into a fight logically with all the details.

469
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:49,365
In the case that your statements don't match

470
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,892
In the case that your statements don't match

471
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,019
or involve lies,

472
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,956
you'll head straight to jail.

473
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:58,457
We'll lock you up.

474
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:59,917
Got that?

475
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:02,069
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

476
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,330
Gosh. Give me the report.

477
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,601
Stop messing around.

478
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,443
Why you...

479
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,718
Excuse me.

480
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:54,754
What's wrong?

481
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,858
I actually...

482
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,928
have something to tell you.

483
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,404
Well, you see...

484
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:12,339
Sir, it's an emergency.

485
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:14,716
I need your help.

486
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:20,356
- An elderly dementia patient went missing? 
 - Yes, sir.

487
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,066
You can just trace their phone.

488
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:25,952
Their phone is off, so we can't track it via satellite.

489
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,822
 They can't track us with his phone turned off. 

490
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:30,533
I only have the cell tower data,

491
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:32,143
and the last call was made in this area.

492
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,270
 What about the security cameras? 

493
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,998
The smallest radius from a cell tower only reaches four to five kilometers.

494
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:41,669
We don't have the time to go through all the cameras within that radius.

495
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:45,172
 How would they ever go through all those cameras? 

496
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,716
I'd rather look for a needle in a haystack.

497
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,801
I get it.

498
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:52,613
That's why I'm only asking you to help me patrol the area a little.

499
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,765
Their son is an assemblyman.

500
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:58,285
The higher-ups want us to put on a show, at least.

501
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:01,580
All right. Tell Officer Kang not to come back

502
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,500
and keep making the rounds.

503
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,151
Yes, sir.

504
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:08,253
What do we do with them?

505
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:10,656
- What? 
 - Them.

506
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:13,232
Let them go with a warning.

507
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:17,388
   

508
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,172
Goodbye.

509
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,705
If you want out, that's fine.

510
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:49,670
Are you really going to do this?

511
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,130
Of course.

512
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,640
I already sent her a picture.

513
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:55,958
What else can I do?

514
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:03,517
I'm off.

515
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,443
Damn it.

516
00:33:12,443 --> 00:33:13,802
Stamp it.

517
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:17,238
   

518
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:19,257
   

519
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,637
 You know what? 

520
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:28,083
 I was so determined 

521
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,252
 to make a fresh start after my service. 

522
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:33,797
 That's what I promised myself. 

523
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,883
 But I'm screwed. 

524
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,009
 I think my life is over. 

525
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,747
 Some have it easy 

526
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:45,033
 because they were just born into a rich family, 

527
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,636
 but for some, our lives are over 

528
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:50,636
 the moment we're done serving in the military. 

529
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,858
 That's how things are. 

530
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:01,057
   

531
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,171
Hey.

532
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:19,417
Are you sure you can get the money

533
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,678
without getting caught?

534
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,264
Yes.

535
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,176
What about Minwoo?

536
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:31,080
Will you let him go afterward?

537
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:39,497
Of course.

538
00:34:39,497 --> 00:34:41,197
How?

539
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,163
I have a plan.

540
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:08,334
Who are you? What's going on?

541
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,794
Untie me!

542
00:35:09,794 --> 00:35:11,312
Come on!

543
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:13,212
Hey!

544
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,521
What the heck?

545
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:38,547
   

546
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:42,759
   

547
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:45,830
   

548
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,880
   

549
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,249
 You've been kidnapped. 

550
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,959
 If you calmly cooperate, 

551
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:54,354
 you'll be safely returned to your family. 

552
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,863
   

553
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:07,518
 If you've understood me, nod once. 

554
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:09,369
 If you've understood me, nod once. 

555
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:22,132
   

556
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:28,772
 Are you going to disobey me, Park Minwoo? 

557
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:06,418
Junseong.

558
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:15,902
Do you take me for a pushover?

559
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:25,030
credit

560
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:31,599
