1
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,881
Hey!

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,000


3
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,910
   

4
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,860
   

5
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,670
   

6
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,400
   

7
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:16,791
   

8
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,914
Hey.

9
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,947
Can we talk?

10
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,381
I went to that house yesterday.

11
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,981
 I'm Detective Cha Jaegyeong from Gwanak Police Station. 

12
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,914
 Local police officers came by the other day. 

13
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,981
 This is a follow-up investigation. 

14
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,481
 Follow up? 

15
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,114
 It's all part of the normal protocol. 

16
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,181
 Can I take a look around the house? 

17
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,347
 Excuse me. 

18
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:13,781
 You've got a big place here. 

19
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,647
 It's just the two of you? 

20
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,647
 No one else? 

21
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,581
 No. 

22
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:39,347
 I went inside the house with Cheol's mom's master key. 

23
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:50,181
 The problem with old houses 

24
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:54,081
 is that there's no heat in the bathroom. Right? 

25
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,347
 What? 

26
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,147
 It's chilly in here. 

27
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:59,947
 Ah, yeah. 

28
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,647
 Where is your room? 

29
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,414
 Ah... 

30
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,147
 There. 

31
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:11,781
 Ah. 

32
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:30,261
 They have a kid locked up in the closet. 

33
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:13,414
 Can you leave if you're done? 

34
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,214
 Yes, sorry for bothering you this late. 

35
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,547
 Thank you for your cooperation. 

36
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:27,647
 Just a moment. 

37
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,547
 I think you need to call someone. 

38
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,081
 Sorry? 

39
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,514
 It's not level, don't you see? 

40
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:14,381
 Ah! Yeah, you're right. 

41
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:20,814
There was absolutely nothing.

42
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:24,247
I even checked the bathroom.

43
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:27,781
No, that can't be.

44
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,714
Why would I lie to you?

45
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,381
Here.

46
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,981
Are you sure you saw it?

47
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:44,214
I didn't see, I only heard.

48
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,647
What do you mean? Heard what?

49
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:50,714
I heard them fighting and making threats.

50
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,447
You only heard it?

51
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,647
So this was just a wild goose chase then.

52
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:02,481
What did you say? Wild what?

53
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,781
You must've been hearing things since you were desperate.

54
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,481
Come again?

55
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,147
What I mean to say is—

56
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:16,047
What do you mean I was desperate? Give it to me straight.

57
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,347
Well, you're interview is coming up and you needed something.

58
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:23,814
You did that out of desperation. Am I wrong?

59
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:29,181
So you're saying I made this all up just for the interview?

60
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,614
I'm not saying you did it on purpose,

61
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:38,847
but maybe it's because you're so distressed these days.

62
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,347
What the heck are you saying?

63
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,614
Just get lost.

64
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:46,614
I've had enough!

65
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,114
You're been so edgy while preparing

66
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,714
for the police exams, I can't say anything without you getting all riled up.

67
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:56,047
Hey! What's the big deal that I became a cop first?

68
00:07:56,047 --> 00:08:00,947
The way you've been treating me, that's your inferiority complex, you know.

69
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:06,481
You didn't come to make peace.

70
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:09,147
You came to tell me that I was wrong.

71
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:12,747
Don't ever come to see me again. Until I die.

72
00:08:12,747 --> 00:08:14,514
Hey...

73
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,047
We haven't heard from the abductors yet.

74
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:31,647
Park Minwoo's phone signal was last picked up

75
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,047
by that over there.

76
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,214
It has a four-kilometer radius, maybe five.

77
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:40,814
That means it pretty much covers the entire neighborhood.

78
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,847
So how many people are we talking about?

79
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:46,781
Well, just his classmates alone total 30.

80
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:49,781
If we include his alumni too, it would be in the hundreds.

81
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:53,681
So basically, three days is not enough.

82
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:58,447
You called me out here to say you can't do it?

83
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:00,414
No, of course not.

84
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,847
I came up with a brilliant idea.

85
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:04,814
What is it?

86
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:07,547
Well, it's...

87
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,514
Hypnosis.

88
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,647
Of who?

89
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:20,481
The lady, of course. Since she heard it firsthand.

90
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:25,114
 Reunion. 

91
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:29,314
 He went to a high school reunion a few times. 

92
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:04,947
I saw a police station on the way here.

93
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:07,447
Will it be okay?

94
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:11,747
It's exactly a 15-minute drive. Nothing to worry about.

95
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:15,781
Taking ten billion won in 15 minutes.

96
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,201
Is it possible?

97
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,123
Sure, it's possible. It has to be.

98
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,089
As long as we don't get caught.

99
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,556
Besides, it's safer than getting the money from Minwoo's mom.

100
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:35,089
What about the safe? How are we going to open it?

101
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:36,523
Minwoo will.

102
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:39,489
You want to bring Park Minwoo here?

103
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:44,089
Or we could get the combination from him and open it ourselves.

104
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:53,623
But our problem right now is Park Minwoo.

105
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:56,956
He's so pissed off at us that he didn't even eat breakfast.

106
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:01,056
Why that fucking bastard.

107
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,489
Honestly, haven't we done all we can for him?

108
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,956
We even had a detective breathing down our necks.

109
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:13,056
Still, I think we were a little harsh on him.

110
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:16,723
We even put a blanket over him. What more does he want?

111
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,523
   

112
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,189
I will wait outside.

113
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,823
Stay.

114
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,589
What if something happens?

115
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,023
They told me that your son has been kidnapped.

116
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,689
Yes.

117
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,989
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure if this is going to work.

118
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:55,389
I don't want you to get your hopes up too high.

119
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:59,156
Thank you.

120
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:04,823
But... do you know how I feel?

121
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:10,756
I want to cut off all ten of my fingers.

122
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,256
And that means,

123
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:15,723
if it could help me find my son,

124
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:20,256
I could do the same to someone else.

125
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:24,356
I have the power to do that, too.

126
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:29,089
So, no need to feel pressured.

127
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,756
You can relax.

128
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:36,956
Relax, and just do the best you can.

129
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,089
Okay.

130
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,423
Then, shall we start right away? Okay.

131
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:51,256
I want you to focus on my hand.

132
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:57,656
Just relax and look at my hand.

133
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:00,956
Okay, very slowly...

134
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:07,456
If you're ready, I'm going to apply a little pressure.

135
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:14,123
You are going to go on a journey.

136
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:31,989
As for the combination, I'll tell you if you take me there.

137
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,623
I mean, how am I supposed to trust you?

138
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:36,456
Minwoo,

139
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:42,223
we're doing this so we don't have to kill you.

140
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:45,523
If we split the money in that safe, that makes us accomplices.

141
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:48,023
I know. I'm the one who suggested it, why wouldn't I know?

142
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:51,156
You know, but why are you saying you want to come with us?

143
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:54,656
Be honest. You're up to something, aren't you, you bastard?

144
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:57,089
I'm warning you. Watch what you say.

145
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,123
I'm not the bastard, you are, got it?

146
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,423
Did you just call me a bastard?

147
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,556
Why can't I?

148
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,223
You're the one who put me in a washing machine.

149
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,089
Hey, get the fuck up.

150
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,589
Was ten minutes of spin drying not enough? How about 20 minutes? That'll be fun.

151
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:11,923
Cut it out!

152
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,723
So get the fuck up!

153
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,856
That's enough!

154
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,023
Junseong,

155
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:35,289
you already verified that the safe is stored there.

156
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,723
And there's money in there, of course.

157
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:42,523
If you take me there, I'll open it myself.

158
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:47,689
I swear, I'm not up to anything. For real.

159
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,756
Just think about it.

160
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,456
To live, I have to be an accomplice.

161
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,523
So why would I do something stupid?

162
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,223
That psycho Song Jaehyo would kill me right away.

163
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,556
What? Hey! Hey!

164
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:03,956
Want me to kill you now, huh?

165
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,489
Hey.

166
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,789
I don't ever want to hear you speak my name again.

167
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:20,223
And don't try to gaslight Junseong, got it?

168
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:23,189
I have no reason to speak your name anyway.

169
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:36,356
By the way, Junseong...

170
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:41,256
Do you have the money?

171
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:44,989
You'll need a lot of money to carry out your plan.

172
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:52,289
No.

173
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:54,389
No, Minwoo.

174
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,589
Don't go there.

175
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,423
Please, don't go there.

176
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,089
Listen to your mom.

177
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,623
Listen to your mom, Minwoo. Please!

178
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:06,056
- Stop this. 
 - No, no. We're almost there.

179
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,989
Okay, ma'am, calm down.

180
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:11,989
Relax and breathe out slowly.

181
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,456
Don't go! Don't go, Minwoo!

182
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,456
Don't go!

183
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:22,789
Okay. We're going to go a little further back in time.

184
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,133
Go back a little further.

185
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,689
No, I can't!

186
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,889
My son, my son just went out to meet them.

187
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,989
- I have to bring my son back. 
 - Hold on.

188
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:36,089
Who are the people Minwoo went to meet?

189
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,289
They... They are...

190
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,589
Who are they?

191
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:45,323
Im...

192
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:49,256
 Geez, Im Taeyeong's coming? 

193
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,889
 Where's Taeyeong? 

194
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,156
 He couldn't make it. 

195
00:16:55,156 --> 00:16:57,423
 Im Taeyeong. 

196
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,323
What? You want money from us?

197
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,689
We already apologized. Isn't that enough?

198
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,656
It's not like we ratted you out. What more do you want?

199
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,356
What's going on?

200
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,350
What the— Scared the shit out of me!

201
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,084
Want to settle for two million per person,

202
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:24,756
or want to end your life right here? Choose.

203
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:28,656
   

204
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,989
 Number 278, please come in. 

205
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,689
Yes.

206
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,056
All right. On to the next question then.

207
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:49,756
It says here that you volunteered in the neighborhood watch program.

208
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:51,356
How long did you do it?

209
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:53,823
Around two years.

210
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,523
Wow, that's quite a long time. How was it?

211
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:00,089
It was great.

212
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:03,956
I was happy to assist the police officers at the community policing center.

213
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,889
Most of all, during those two years,

214
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:11,189
the crime rate in our neighborhood went down by 5%.

215
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:13,623
This is the final question.

216
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:16,389
If you are in a situation where both your safety

217
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,856
and the victim's safety are at risk,

218
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:22,223
what would you do?

219
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:29,756
In that situation, I would immediately...

220
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,811
Applicant?

221
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,089
Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:47,523
I would immediately...

223
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,911
 You didn't answer the question? 

224
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:22,314
My mind suddenly went blank and I couldn't say a word.

225
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:26,047
 Why? It's a straightforward question. Didn't you prepare a model answer? 

226
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:28,414
Of course I did.

227
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:32,081
I did, but I don't know what happened to me.

228
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,914
 You'll be fine. You aced everything else. 

229
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,514
 - Just forget about it.  
 - Yeah.

230
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:40,914
I'm going to take it easy today. You have a good day, too.

231
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,814
 Yeah, training is about to begin. 

232
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:45,747
Okay. Stay safe and don't get hurt again. See you tomorrow.

233
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,247
 Okay. Love you! 

234
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,081
Bye.

235
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,814
When did you start hanging out with Song Jaehyo?

236
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,614
Why do you ask?

237
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:54,181
Because you're not like him.

238
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:56,281
How so?

239
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:01,447
I mean, Song Jaehyo is a real psychopath.

240
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:04,947
That prick went berserk and decided to kidnap me.

241
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:10,347
He told me you were against this all along.

242
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:16,581
So, what is it you want from me?

243
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:21,747
What do you want from driving a wedge between Jaehyo and me?

244
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:29,714
No, it's not that. Why would I do that?

245
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:33,947
Untie my feet at least. I have to get in the car, don't I?

246
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,114
Junseong.

247
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,981
Put your feet down.

248
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:51,814
Only untie him once we get the money.

249
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:56,647
Then, do you expect me to hop into the car?

250
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:00,781
You're not going in the car. You're going in here.

251
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,814
Are you telling me to get in the suitcase?

252
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,247
Yeah. Ah, we have to gag you first.

253
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:09,414
I'm a human being, not luggage.

254
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:10,581
Why don't you shut that mouth?

255
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,847
You even went in the washing machine.

256
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:14,881
It's only for a little while.

257
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:16,281
I told you he's a psycho.

258
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,781
Let's do this then.

259
00:23:18,781 --> 00:23:21,014
We untie his feet.

260
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:23,281
But you have to go in the suitcase.

261
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:25,081
- Don't want to. 
 - Me neither.

262
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:25,981
Geez.

263
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:29,447
You don't have a choice. You're a hostage.

264
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:32,381
Psychopath.

265
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,881
- You crazy bastard. 
 - Jaehyo!

266
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:34,781
What? Why?

267
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,214
- Let go! 
 - Come on.

268
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,347
What's wrong with you?

269
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:40,481
I said let go! Aren't you tired of playing the nice guy?

270
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,347
Until when do I have to do everything your way?

271
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:44,647
I've done everything you wanted.

272
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:46,914
I agreed to take him with us.

273
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:49,014
I even put clothes on him as you wanted.

274
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,647
Then shouldn't you fucking listen to me for once?

275
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:55,381
Okay. But don't treat Minwoo like that. Come here. Let's talk.

276
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,781
Let go!

277
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:01,014
Am I wrong? Answer me.

278
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:05,814
I'll do it. I'll go in there.

279
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:08,714
It's not a big deal anyway.

280
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,847
Come on. Load the luggage.

281
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:58,347
Excuse me. You're Mr. Im Taeyeong, right?

282
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,081
Who are you?

283
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:04,347
Ah, it's about separating the trash.

284
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,410
Where is Park Minwoo?

285
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,940
Park Minwoo. Answer me.

286
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:25,181
I'm going to take my hand away.

287
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:30,881
But if you scream, I'm going to kill you. Understand?

288
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,647
Okay... let go of my hand.

289
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,947
Where is Park Minwoo?

290
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:44,114
But who are you really?

291
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:47,214
Why are you doing this to me?

292
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,047
And how do you know my name?

293
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:02,614
Holy shit.

294
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:04,881
Answer the question.

295
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,647
Okay.

296
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:12,221
He's a classmate from high school. But I haven't seen him.

297
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,290
A few of us planned to get together

298
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,514
for drinks a few days ago, but we called it off.

299
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:19,181
Who are the others?

300
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:22,714
Song Jaehyo and Lee Junseong.

301
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,047
I never went there.

302
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:25,514
Where do those punks live now?

303
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:28,414
Those punks... uh...

304
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:31,047
I don't know about Lee Junseong,

305
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,204
but Song Jaehyo...

306
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,314
Sillim-dong. That's where he lives.

307
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:40,779
Uh... Daeyang Villa. Yes, Daeyang Villa.

308
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:54,381
   

309
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,181
 Hey, slow down. 

310
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,014
Wait a sec.

311
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:20,347
Hold it up higher.

312
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:24,881
One, two, three. Oh shit!

313
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,147
- I'm backing out. 
 - Yeah.

314
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:01,547
- Why isn't it moving? 
 - What are you doing?

315
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:02,881
It's not moving.

316
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,714
What are you saying?

317
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,247
Hey, get out of the way!

318
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:09,647
Okay.

319
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,514
Come. Back out straight.

320
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,847
A bit more. More, more, more.

321
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,514
No, stop!

322
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:17,747
Go forward then back.

323
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:19,547
Forward?

324
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,747
Hey! Hey!

325
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,314
Center. That's it. Back, back.

326
00:28:39,314 --> 00:28:40,381
I think I'm going to hit the wall.

327
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,814
You won't! Come on.

328
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:51,081
Hey, mister! Move!

329
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,147
Mister, back up!

330
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:57,514
Hey, come with me!

331
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:02,314
- Okay? 
 - Yeah, come.

332
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,581
More, more.

333
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,281
Okay, stop.

334
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,381
- Get in! 
 - Okay.

335
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,214
You didn't have to yell at me like that.

336
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,081
Why don't you drive properly then?

337
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:55,281
Hey, Park Minwoo!

338
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:36,181
What time is it? Isn't it past ten?

339
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,047
Why isn't he going home?

340
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:39,581
He will soon.

341
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,847
Hey, he's coming out!

342
00:30:42,614 --> 00:30:44,647
He came out.

343
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,747
Are you sure he's leaving?

344
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,081
Yeah, I'm sure.

345
00:30:53,414 --> 00:30:55,081
- Let's go. 
 - Hey.

346
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:57,581
Let Minwoo out first.

347
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:10,581
Darn it. Where did they go?

348
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,214
Three?

349
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:30,947
What? He's alive.

350
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:36,214
 If you are in a situation where both your safety 

351
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,647
 and the victim's safety are at risk, 

352
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,914
 what would you do? 

353
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:46,981
What the heck...

354
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,088
Turn your head.

355
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,780
Shit!

356
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,203
Ready?

357
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:11,303
- Yeah. 
 - Wait a sec.

358
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:13,547
Careful, careful.

359
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:19,947
- Come on. 
 - Hurry up and go.

360
00:32:20,947 --> 00:32:22,047
What are you doing?

361
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,181
- I feel really nauseous. 
 - Cut the crap and get moving.

362
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:25,830
Careful. Careful.

363
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,947
Yeah.

364
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,714
- Is this the right way? 
 - Yeah, it is.

365
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,347
Keep moving.

366
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:57,781
Darn, what the hell!

367
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:59,414
Keep quiet, will you?

368
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:01,381
Walk faster.

369
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,681
Found it. It's this one.

370
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,347
It is?

371
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:24,614
Yep.

372
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:33,547
There are three locks. I need the cutter.

373
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,514
Hey, Minwoo. I need the light.

374
00:33:38,514 --> 00:33:40,347
Quick.

375
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,547
What are you doing? We need the light.

376
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,181
Stop moving your darn head.

377
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,947
Shit. Why won't it break?

378
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:13,514
It won't break?

379
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:19,214
Where is our hammer?

380
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,614
I'm sure I put it in the bag.

381
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,447
Finally.

382
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:25,514
You stole it, didn't you?

383
00:34:25,514 --> 00:34:27,681
What are you saying?

384
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:31,214
How on earth could I steal it?

385
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:36,181
- Get over here. 
 - Why?

386
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:39,014
I said come here! Just do as I say.

387
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:40,514
Fuck! Am I your lapdog?

388
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,747
Keep it down, both of you!

389
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,081
Hey, you hold this.

390
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:45,947
Hold it.

391
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:47,181
Hold onto it.

392
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:49,781
Hang on a sec. I think we should cut it here.

393
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:52,414
One, two, three.

394
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:59,247
Hang on. One, two, three.

395
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,688
- Hey! 
 - What the...

396
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:47,237
If you make one more move,I'm sending this to the police.

397
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:50,681
Unit 101! I know you're a medical student.

398
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,547
Who is she?

399
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:56,214
Unit 102?

400
00:35:56,214 --> 00:36:00,214
Stop talking. You, the tall one, come over here quick.

401
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:02,114
You mean... me?

402
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:04,547
Yes, come on! Quickly!

403
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:07,681
- What? The hammer. 
 - Why that...

404
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,314
You bastards are dead meat.

405
00:36:10,314 --> 00:36:13,014
Search all you want. You think you'll find the money in there?

406
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:14,981
You fuckers.

407
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:16,647
What?

408
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:19,114
- Is your leg okay? 
 - Yes.

409
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:22,981
- Take this. 
 - What is it?

410
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,414
Go out the way you came and you'll see a scooter.

411
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:28,747
You'll find a tool to untie your hands. Head straight to the police.

412
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:31,147
Don't move!

413
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,347
I said don't move.

414
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:37,581
But aren't you coming with me?

415
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:39,247
Those punks have a van.

416
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,481
I'll watch them, so just hurry up and go.

417
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,847
Thank you.

418
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:47,132
You don't have to thank me.

419
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,994
Just go!

420
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,414
You have to stay safe.

421
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:02,814
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

422
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,947
Don't... Don't move!

423
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:09,252
Wait... Wait...

424
00:37:09,252 --> 00:37:11,347
Are you guys trying to play me?

425
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:13,581
- Hey. 
 - Shit.

426
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:29,347
Nobody move.

427
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:55,991
   

428
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:05,970
