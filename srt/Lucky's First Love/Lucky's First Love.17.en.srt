3
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,620
（Resignation Letter)

4
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,380
I just want to know

5
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,220
if you have made a decision.

6
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,640
It's very simple to face Xia Ke.

7
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,100
Just tell him

8
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,660
how deeply you love me.

9
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,620
Why?

10
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,500
Because you need to let him believe

11
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,620
the reason why you resign

12
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,420
is completely because of me.

13
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,060
In this way, he won't

14
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,620
have a sense of guilt in his heart.

15
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,540
Then he can calmly accept to

16
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,020
use the investment money gained
from your resign.

17
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,420
Yes, I know what I'm doing.

18
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,340
I love him.

19
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,620
I'd like to give up my job for him.

20
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,520
(Leader's signature: Xia...)

21
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,320
(Leader's signature: Xia Ke)

22
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,140
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

23
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,860
Xing Yun.

24
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,660
You're employeed.

25
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,620
Only we two work in such a big company.

26
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,820
Isn't it a waste?

27
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,420
You're not confident about me, right?

28
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Start working!

29
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,660
Thank you for your care

30
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,900
for such a long time.

31
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,380
All hope all of you can be confident about TIG

32
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,180
as well as Mr. Xia.

33
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
Wherever I go,

34
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
I will give my best wishes to you.

35
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,220
I wish our game

36
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,500
can comfort and encourage

37
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,900
anyone who needs to be healed,

38
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,500
including us.

39
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,220
Take care!

40
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,100
I'm leaving.

41
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,380
Bye!

42
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,900
Come on!

43
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,140
The 128 matters needing attention

44
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,820
in Mr. Xia's daily life.

45
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,020
His coffee should be made with four cups of water
and six cups of coffee beans.

46
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,580
The font size in his document should be fifth.

47
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,140
Keep his two power banks

48
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,460
charged fully all the time.

49
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,860
Being allergic to pollen,

50
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,100
he also hates perfumes with floral fragrance.

51
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
(Gift for coming back)
he also hates perfumes with floral fragrance.

52
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,820
During the process of the secret leakage,

53
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,280
as the one who is mainly in charge,

54
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,580
she didn't realise the problem in time.

55
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,220
Her existence is a hidden trouble to me.

56
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,780
As for the personnel transfer of TIG,

57
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,380
you don't need to bother.

58
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,180
What about the next investment money for TIG?

59
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,140
When will it enter account?

60
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,180
Need I bother?

61
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,580
Did you get the pay?

62
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,060
Let me see.

63
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,300
I just received it.

64
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,380
Xia Ke.

65
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,300
I've stayed abroad

66
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,660
for a long time this time.

67
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,260
According to Mr. Duan,

68
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,100
you have some problems communicating with each other,

69
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,700
which has caused the stagnancy of

70
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,900
Instance Zones.

71
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
We did have difficulty communicating with each other.

72
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,860
But the Instance Zones is still developing.

73
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,980
That's good.

74
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,580
I criticized him just now.

75
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,060
When doing projects,

76
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,820
we shouldn't be too timid and overcautious.

77
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,900
You're right.

78
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,100
You're really right, Mr. Sun.

79
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,500
Mr. Xia, I will ask the financial management department

80
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
to pay the investment money
into the account this afternoon.

81
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Sun.

82
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,700
I don't come to

83
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,860
discuss the game with you.

84
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,340
Oh?

85
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,380
I think our cooperation

86
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,580
can come to end.

87
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,620
What are you saying?

88
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,540
Xia Ke,

89
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,620
what do you mean?

90
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
It's true that the investment money
is delayed for some time.

91
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,340
But you can't terminate the contract.

92
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,580
You know,

93
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,900
as for TIG,

94
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,940
it's the most crucial time for you
to research and develop the game.

95
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,900
Mr. Sun,

96
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,780
your company aims to advance the speed of the game

97
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,180
instead of its quality.

98
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,500
I totally disagree with you on this point.

99
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,500
As for the contract,

100
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,780
I'll ask the lawyer to deal with it.

101
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,180
I'm leaving now.

102
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,380
Xia Ke.

103
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,340
Xia Ke.

104
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Sun.

105
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,900
I...

106
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,940
He...

107
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,940
Sooner or later, he will

108
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,740
pay the price of his pride and arrogance.

109
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,580
I'm late. I'm late.

110
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,940
It's so bad.

111
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,820
Mom, it's too late.

112
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,580
I have no time to have breakfast.

113
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,940
What are you doing?

114
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,900
You don't need to go to work.

115
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,340
Why are you in such a hurry?

116
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,020
Are you ok?

117
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
I'm fine.

118
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,220
Stay for a moment.

119
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,660
You resigned your job

120
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,380
and didn't tell us the reason.

121
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,460
Do you purposely

122
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,940
want me and your mother to worry about you?

123
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,580
You're going out without having breakfast.

124
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,980
What are you going for? Rob someone?

125
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,580
Dad, there is something urgent.

126
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,740
I'm not lying.

127
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,260
(He Yu: Are you awake? I'm waiting for you downstairs)
He Yu is waiting for me outside our building.

128
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,420
There isn't enough time. I'm leaving.

129
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,940
You come so quickly.
It's not like what a woman does.

130
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,700
Are you well-prepared in advance?

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,940
Thank you!

132
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,940
For what?

133
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,820
Nothing.

134
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,660
Why are you here? Don't you need to work?

135
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,180
Weather's fine,

136
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,500
so I want to have breakfast with you
who is out of work.

137
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,260
Did you have breakfast?

138
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,060
That's good.

139
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,020
Let's go to have breakfast.

140
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,020
Let's go.

141
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,020
(President's Office)

142
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,340
Mr. Xia, Miss. Yao comes.

143
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,140
Come in, please.

144
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,940
I don't remember we have an appointment.

145
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,460
I thought you would call me

146
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,100
to get drunk in the bar

147
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,900
or release in the Kendo club.

148
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,700
Having waited for several days without any call,

149
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,140
I have to come here without being invited.

150
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,580
Now I know what is so called

151
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,940
a great flash of anger for the beauty.

152
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,140
How are you now?

153
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,220
In order to vent your anger for Xing Yun,

154
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,020
you terminated the contract with the investor.

155
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,220
As for your several houses,

156
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,460
most of them have been sold, right?

157
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,380
Do you lack of money?

158
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,860
You know, in the whole game industry,

159
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,160
from competing for the playing method
to intellectual property,

160
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,420
to Pixel-level plagiarism,

161
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,580
everybody desires to earn extra money

162
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,080
so that they neglect everything of this industry.

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,060
I have thought it over.

164
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,160
The earlier I get rid of the economic kidnapping
of the outsider investor,

165
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,200
the earlier I can jump out of the vicious circle.

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,700
How great you are! Mr. Xia.

167
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,340
Being so frustrated,

168
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,700
you still have such high-spirited
and vigorous dreams.

169
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,300
But do you know,

170
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,140
outside this door,

171
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,500
all of your dear staff are thinking

172
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,100
how to use signboard of TIG

173
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,820
to gain a great promotion.

174
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,420
It's understandable.

175
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,740
Having blind faith is a gift.

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,180
(Yun)
Not everyone has such a gift.

177
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,080
(Yun)

178
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,860
Then what are you going to do next?

179
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,980
I will find a new investor

180
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,020
and boldly reform the strategies of the company.

181
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,340
What about counting me in your company?

182
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,540
It's clear that

183
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,780
you are in need of workers like me
who don't care the salary.

184
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,260
Time for your interview.

185
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,380
You failed.

186
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,740
The employees that we TIG need

187
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,940
are the people who really love games.

188
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,500
What are you drawing?

189
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,620
I'm drawing a lion.

190
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,500
My favorite animal is lion.

191
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,940
Lions are very powerful.

192
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,180
How could you suddenly change your identity
to a teacher, Miss Xing?

193
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,340
Do you really want to change your profession?

194
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,220
I just have a lesson for my classmate.

195
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,140
Why are you here?

196
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,260
Obviously my mother betrayed me again.

197
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,740
Are you really so hardhearted,

198
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,060
harming others without benefiting yourself?

199
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,580
Is this what you ordered?

200
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,300
How to eat?

201
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,060
Without eating something hot,
you won't have a complete life.

202
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,660
We need to take something new sometimes.

203
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,180
Anyhow, I used to eat

204
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
such things in the company before.

205
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,620
Mr. Xia, they are all hot.

206
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,460
Rinse them with water.

207
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,700
It seems that they're someone's favorite.

208
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,700
Haven't you adapted yourself

209
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,940
to the life after resigning?

210
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,700
Anyhow it's my first job.

211
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,460
Although I left determinedly,

212
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,060
I still hoped to

213
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,500
have some of my traces

214
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,100
there.

215
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,100
I wonder if they would miss me

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,640
and if they would be used
to the life without me.

217
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Actually, being out of work is just like
being disappointed in love.

218
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm always worrying about gains and losses.

219
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,960
Do you know the condition of TIG now?

220
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,580
It's certain that they have successfully
got the investment money

221
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,560
and engaged in busy work of the Instance Zones.

222
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,540
When I called Amy and Yiyi these days,

223
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,980
they just hung up quickly after a few words.

224
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,260
I guess they must be very busy.

225
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,740
I'm now out of work,

226
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,460
sorry to disturb them.

227
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,340
Actually.

228
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,340
It's nothing.

229
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,900
It really tastes terrible.

230
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,240
Did I force you to eat?

231
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,620
If you don't like it, don't eat.

232
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,860
I don't think the atmosphere here is suitable for

233
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,660
today's topic.

234
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,220
Sit down! A bottle of whiskey, please.

235
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,140
I think

236
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,500
a good mood is important for having a talk.

237
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,620
As long as you are in a good mood,

238
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,820
you can get double results by doing half the work.

239
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,980
Cheers.

240
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,260
I've been dreaming of developing a mobile game.

241
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,540
Money is absolutely not a problem.

242
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,980
But it must be the best one,

243
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,340
which is unprecedented.

244
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,100
As for the team introduction I have sent to you,

245
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,660
did you read it?

246
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,780
Of course I did.

247
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,020
They are working for developing love mobiles.

248
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,580
Right?

249
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,060
I'm interested in love

250
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,420
with great feelings and experiences.

251
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,380
Frankly, today you can make an appointment with me.

252
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,780
I feel very happy.

253
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,940
I think we can

254
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,700
mainly talk about

255
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,460
the love section in this game.

256
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,100
Excuse me, I need to go to the washroom.

257
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,420
You become more beautiful!

258
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,460
Really?

259
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,300
Of course!

260
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,340
Liar!

261
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,860
You always coax us.

262
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,060
What about going out to play?

263
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,940
Ok.

264
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,820
Your friends?

265
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,180
I happen to see two old friends.

266
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,700
Excuse me, I must be leaving.

267
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,940
We can have an appointment another day.

268
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,860
By the way, trust me,

269
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,260
I'm sure to invest for the project.

270
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,660
Let's go.

271
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,340
I'm telling you

272
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,220
there is a place with great fun.

273
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,180
Really?

274
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,580
What Xia Ke's waiting for is not money

275
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,380
but a cooperative partner with common interests.

276
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,860
You know him so well.

277
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,140
No wonder you can so easily

278
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,100
take Xing Yun away from him.

279
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,300
Xia Ke broke away from the investor.

280
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,220
In a large part,

281
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,020
it's because of Xing Yun's resignation.

282
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,700
I believe he has the ability.

283
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,580
But I'm afraid he can't wait for the chance.

284
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,260
You don't need to remind me that

285
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,500
how contemptible I am by doing that.

286
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,060
He Yu, I find it hard to understand you.

287
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,580
I'm wondering if what you did
is to show your love to Xing Yun

288
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,900
or compete with Xia Ke.

289
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,740
Obviously

290
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,060
you have got Xing Yun,

291
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,220
but you still look unhappy.

292
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,420
Who said that?

293
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,420
I'm more than happy.

294
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,820
I'm sure to make Xing Yun live a happy life.

295
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,780
How?

296
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,060
Hide the fact that TIG is in trouble

297
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,940
to make her feel

298
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,260
her sacrifice is worthwhile, right?

299
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,060
I'm wondering if you are my ally.

300
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,580
Don't you think it is the best time for you

301
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,740
to get close to Xia Ke?

302
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,860
Recently, I've been thinking

303
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,620
if there is still any significance of

304
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,180
our alignment.

305
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,380
In the last two months,

306
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,140
TIG has been short-handed
because of staff demission

307
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,340
and many bugs can't be fixed timely,

308
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
which has caused a massive loss
of the players of Infinite.

309
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,580
Mobile games are always upgrading very quickly.

310
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,420
But the Instance Zones is unable
to be put online.

311
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,260
Really we are facing a temporary shortage.

312
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,300
The money spent on maintaining the server

313
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,580
is more than the income of the game this month.

314
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,700
No wonder what will happen if it goes on like this.

315
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,380
Send a letter to all the players

316
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,580
and ask the distributors to take the game offline
at the same time.

317
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,020
You meant to close the server?

318
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,140
Generally, if such situation

319
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,460
continues for over three months,

320
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,580
you can consider closing the server.

321
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,100
Striving hard to maintain the present situation
doesn't make sense.

322
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,020
Now that we hope to make a breakthrough,

323
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,820
it's better for us to show our determination
by cutting off all means to retreat.

324
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,860
Over these years,

325
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,140
we have been bounded by the investor.

326
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,700
Actually, as for the Infinite,
there are still many parts

327
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,580
that we can work better at.

328
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,580
Mr. Xia,

329
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,140
the staff are already very anxious and panic.

330
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,140
If we close the server of the game,

331
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,060
I'm afraid more staff will leave.

332
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,940
You'd better think it over. Mr. Xia.

333
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,900
It doesn't matter.

334
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,060
What we really need is the one who stays.

335
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,420
What happened?

336
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,740
Mr. Xia, is it true that the company
can't keep running?

337
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,500
If the game is stopped,

338
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,740
what can we do?

339
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,460
Yeah. What can we do?

340
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,300
Mr. Xia, we have feelings of Infinite.

341
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,700
You can't give up so easily.

342
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,740
What do you think? Everybody?

343
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,580
Yeah!

344
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,740
Thank you for your great passion for the company.

345
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,980
Having a stop is to have a better start again.

346
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Don't worry.

347
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,340
The reason why we did so

348
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,460
is not because we want to give up Infinite,

349
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,780
but to reform it with a new version,

350
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,620
which will be put online together
with the Instance Zones later.

351
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,980
It's a great chance for the rebirth of TIG.

352
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,780
Of course, Mr. Xia also considers that

353
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,820
you have the right of choice.

354
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,780
As for anyone who'd like to stay,

355
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,100
we will pay your salary on time.

356
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,940
Otherwise,

357
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,740
you can leave with double salary.

358
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,420
Don't tell her what happened in the company.

359
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,500
Just rest assured, Mr. Xia.

360
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,980
We won't tell Xing Yun.

361
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,380
Rest assured, Mr. Xia.

362
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,820
Dear player,

363
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,820
I'm sorry to inform you that

364
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,380
Infinite Unknown Love

365
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
will close all the servers in a week.

366
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,500
Thank you

367
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,380
for your support and company during the operation.

368
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,900
We will continue to provide you

369
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,940
with newer and more interesting games.

370
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,260
Please pay close attention to the news announcement
on TIG's official website.

371
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,500
Be there or be square.

372
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
(Yun)

373
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,900
I want to eat fish.

374
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,780
I don't know how to cook fish.

375
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,180
I want to eat shrimps.

376
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,140
Can't you be serious?

377
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,700
Today is my birthday.

378
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
You have told me that you would follow my order.

379
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,660
You're not a little boy.
How could you still expect to celebrate your birthday?

380
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,700
How old are you?

381
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,940
I want to eat...

382
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,460
I want to eat fish, shrimps

383
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,380
and...

384
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,340
Open your mouth.

385
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,820
Eat slowly!

386
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,580
You want to choke me to death?

387
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,020
I win.

388
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,780
You're mine today!

389
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,420
Come in. please.

390
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,700
How do you think?

391
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,420
Are you attracted by my taste?

392
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,660
Unexpectedly, the customer manager of 4A company

393
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,860
has such a high salary.

394
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,340
How could it be?

395
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,180
I'm financially supported by my parents

396
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,940
who

397
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,420
have immigrated to Canada

398
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,060
when I was 16.

399
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,460
Every year, they send large amounts of money
to my account

400
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,260
to express their enormous

401
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,100
parental love.

402
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,180
Why didn't you go with them?

403
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,980
I wouldn't go with them.

404
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,420
I took great pains

405
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,140
to stay here.

406
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,780
In their city,

407
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,020
half of the year is winter.

408
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,140
You can hardly see any other people
in the surrounding area.

409
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,900
It's different from here.

410
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,060
We can eat and drink, have friends,

411
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,540
work and have fun.

412
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,780
You really have a strange mind.

413
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,100
It's said that we should cherish our life
and keep away from 4A.

414
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,180
How can you have fun?

415
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,340
Aren't you the fun

416
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,220
I have got in my work?

417
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,500
If you still talk like this, I will leave.

418
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,420
Well.

419
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,340
Let me tell you why I went to Jiawo.

420
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,820
Don't laugh at me.

421
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,980
Why did you ask us to have an interview here?

422
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,660
You have been dreaming of working
in an advertising company, right?

423
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,900
He wants to get rid of the bondage of his grandma.

424
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,780
As an international company, Jiawo

425
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,540
is the most suitable for you two.

426
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,420
What about you?

427
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,300
Is there any need to ask me?

428
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,020
Hello. You are also here to have an interview, right?

429
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,700
Me, too.

430
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,900
The most ridiculous is that

431
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,660
the beautiful girl didn't pass the interview,

432
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,220
while we three left

433
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,060
to work as trainees.

434
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,500
The top three of the interview has come out.

435
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,060
Xia Ke, Yao Qing and He Yu.

436
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,660
In Jiawo,

437
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,260
office love is banned by explicit order.

438
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,380
Someone told me that

439
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,940
the first and the second

440
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,500
have broken the rule.

441
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,140
How could there be such rumors?

442
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,620
It's no use explaining now.

443
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,100
I want to tell you

444
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,340
working in Jiawo

445
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,380
is a good chance.

446
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,820
You can think it over.

447
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,740
Only one of you can stay.

448
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,420
Xia Ke.

449
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,700
It's better for me to start up my own business.

450
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,540
So Xia Ke left the company.

451
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
Although passing the selection,

452
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Yao Qing wouldn't like to stay there, either.

453
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,860
So she went to the branch company in Shanghai.

454
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
I was left here alone.

455
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,220
It turns out that TIG came into being in this way.

456
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,180
Where is my gift?

457
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,380
It is the birthday cake.

458
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,860
Is it?

459
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,620
You take it so casually.

460
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
You only send me a birthday cake as my gift.

461
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,420
I didn't.

462
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,700
How could I know your favorite things?

463
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,220
Besides, I am rich in time now.

464
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,540
So I made a birthday cake to show my best wishes.

465
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,060
You made it by yourself?

466
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,700
I must have a good taste.

467
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,620
Black forest.

468
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,980
When you were making the cake, are you sure

469
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,620
you were missing me at the moment?

470
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,380
Why should I miss you while making the cake?

471
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,620
I didn't miss anyone.

472
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,620
Have you also invited other friends?

473
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm going to open the door.

474
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,440
Why don't you enter?

475
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,540
Mr. Xia. Miss Yao.

476
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,860
You have resigned.

477
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,540
Just call me Yao Qing. Call him Xia Ke. That's ok.

478
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,620
Why are you standing still?

479
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,540
This is our gift for him.

480
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,140
Why do you come?

481
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,300
It's your birthday today.

482
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,980
Of course we are here to celebrate it for you.

483
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
Happy birthday!

484
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,660
We have chosen it for a long time.

485
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,740
The crystal glasses from Hungary are very expensive.

486
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,500
Xia Ke paid for it.

487
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,980
Quickly take me to your basement

488
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,740
to choose a bottle of good wine to suit the glasses.

489
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,700
Just go by yourself.

490
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,220
You're the host, ok?

491
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,860
Hurry up!

492
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,060
With so many bottles of wine here,
I don't know which one to choose.

493
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,100
Wait, wait, wait.

494
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,900
Please wash them.

495
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,540
Let's go.

496
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,420
Go.

497
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,740
I haven't seen you for several months.
Unexpectedly, you have had so many personal collections.

498
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,820
Which one to choose?

499
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,020
I'm asking you.

500
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,220
You are so warm-hearted today,

501
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,940
taking Xia Ke here without being invited

502
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,820
and sending me a set of crystal glasses,

503
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,620
what do you mean?

504
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,060
You think my life is not tragic enough, right?

505
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,940
I think it's

506
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,460
not suitable for you both to avoid seeing each other.

507
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,820
Well, can't you wait until Xing Yun and I

508
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,500
have a stable relationship?

509
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,500
Buddy, one month has passed.

510
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,540
Have you pressed the “play” button?

511
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,100
How could you expect to be stable?

512
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,940
You are too idealism.

513
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,440
How are you these days?

514
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,980
Seemingly, you are good at cooking.

515
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,700
You have well-prepared to be a house wife, right?

516
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,660
I have plenty of time

517
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,420
hoping to do something.

518
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,740
It's reasonable for me to think that

519
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,420
you have regretted.

520
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,420
This one is good,

521
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,860
the Petrus dry red wine produced in 2000.

522
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,620
That's it.

523
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,380
You.

524
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,300
How is the Instance Zones going on?

525
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,620
Do you care?

526
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,020
I'm just asking.

527
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,340
Seemingly, it goes on smoothly.

528
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,580
How do you know?

529
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,660
According to the red blood streak in your eyes,

530
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,500
you must have stayed up for many nights.

531
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,860
I have run out of eye drops.

532
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,780
Didn't Amy buy it for you?

533
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,820
I've told her

534
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
to buy several bottles of eye drops
and keep them in your drawer.

535
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,740
This is salt.

536
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,140
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

537
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,060
I'm not your Mr. Xia.

538
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Xing Yun, you are really good at cooking.

539
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,540
The beef steaks weren't fried by me.

540
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,300
It was Mr. Xia.

541
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,380
It was Xia Ke who cooked them.

542
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,580
I just mixed the salad.

543
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,580
Then you have good teamwork.

544
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,700
Is it necessary to have teamwork

545
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,580
when frying beef steaks and mixing salad?

546
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,900
If you didn't choose so slowly,

547
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,340
we would have better dishes.

548
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,460
Is there anything with the wine I chose?

549
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,180
It's so fruity and soft.

550
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,540
What do you think, Xing Yun?

551
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,500
Actually, I don't know much of wine.

552
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,140
I think they are about the same.

553
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,020
Then have a taste.

554
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,860
Just have a little.

555
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,420
Mr. Xia.

556
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,860
My girlfriend

557
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,220
is an adult.

558
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,860
You are so eager to make her drunk, right?

559
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,580
It doesn't matter.

560
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,780
I'm not so bad at drinking wine.

561
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,100
Last time you were drunk, you felt extremely bad.

562
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,580
You even didn't know who your mother was.

563
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,980
Last time?

564
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,140
Let's eat the birthday cake.

565
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,780
Black forest.

566
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,580
Isn't it your favorite cake?

567
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,340
I can only make this type of cake.

568
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,300
Today is my birthday.

569
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,580
This is my cake.

570
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
Ok. I'll light the candle for you.

571
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,140
I won't make a wish this year.

572
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,340
Does He Yu celebrate his birthday with you

573
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,300
every year?

574
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,220
He always says he is an empty-nest youth

575
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,460
who doesn't have parents.

576
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,060
Every year, he shamelessly

577
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,420
asks us to celebrate his birthday for him.

578
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,180
It is different this year.

579
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,700
Someone has a preference for love rather than friends.

580
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,060
That is one of my life principles.

581
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,420
Last year, I went abroad.

582
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,220
When I was abroad,

583
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,140
how did you celebrate his birthday?

584
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,980
We did skydiving in Dubai.

585
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,980
Really?

586
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,500
Did he dare to have skydiving?

587
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,300
Is it very strange?

588
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,980
Yeah.

589
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,860
Xing Yun, maybe you don't know

590
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,100
he has acrophobia.

591
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,460
Really?

592
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,340
I remember

593
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,620
when we studied abroad in England,

594
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,100
he was very interested in a girl.

595
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,980
He went to sit in a sky wheel with her.

596
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,700
Finally, it was Xia Ke and I who helped him come out.

597
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,540
How did you persuade him to play skydiving?

598
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,500
He made a wish on his birthday that

599
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,380
he wanted to overcome his acrophobia.

600
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,580
Then I took him to play skydiving.

601
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,860
With my eyes covered,

602
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,620
I was taken to the plane,

603
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,820
tied to a man who weighs 90 kilos

604
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,700
and thrown out the plane.

605
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,900
It proves that you're cured.

606
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,220
Then I should thank you!

607
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,900
By the way,

608
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,540
do you want to sit in a sky wheel?

609
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,100
I've never sat in a sky wheel at night.

610
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,340
With such a long life,

611
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,860
you still have many chances to sit in it.

612
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,820
Have you ever heard that

613
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,100
if lovers can kiss each other

614
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,140
when the ferris  wheel reaches its highest point,

615
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,700
they will be together forever.

616
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,620
Is there really such a saying?

617
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,940
Then let's go.

618
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,460
Anyhow, I will be together with you forever.

619
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,780
Ok, you god of longevity!

620
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,140
Eat up your black forest

621
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,020
and then let's go.

622
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,540
Ok.

623
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,860
Happy birthday!

624
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,940
Happy birthday!

625
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,980
Do you know if He Yu and Xing Yun

626
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,700
will kiss each other in the ferris wheel?

627
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,980
You don't like ferris  wheel.

628
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,620
Why did you propose it?

629
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,900
If you can be cruelly hurt

630
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,500
and lose heart, I think it's worth my proposal.

631
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,580
I did it for you.

632
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,820
No.

633
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,580
What?

634
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,420
They won't kiss each other.

635
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,140
How do you know?

636
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,020
Wait a moment, please.

637
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,300
It's your turn now.

638
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,900
if lovers can kiss each other

639
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,820
when the sky wheel reaches the highest point,

640
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,340
they will be together forever.

641
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,840
(He Yu)

642
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,040
(He Yu)

643
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,580
Did you pull the wrong person by accident?

644
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,860
No.

645
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,340
What do you mean?

646
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
The feeling

647
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,220
is so familiar.

648
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,500
Is it...

649
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,940
How could you be so calm?

650
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,500
Why not? We have bought the tickets.

651
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,620
Of course I will enjoy the beauty of night.

652
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,700
Are you here to enjoy the beauty of night?

653
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,380
I doubt who you're helping.

654
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Xia Ke is the one who deserves to be loved by me seriously.

655
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,420
Do you know what it's like

656
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,300
when loving someone seriously?

657
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,740
I will pursue him confidently

658
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,540
without begging him shamelessly,

659
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
let alone forcing him by any kind of means.

660
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,780
If he loves someone else,

661
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,380
I will wish them happiness.

662
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,820
In the restaurant,

663
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,500
was it you?

664
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,220
Actually, in the restaurant...

665
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,320
Was it you?

666
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,100
Probably he regards you as

667
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,220
He Yu's girlfriend.

668
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,380
So he feels guilty.

669
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,140
Of course I know you two pretended to do that.

670
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,020
And you needn't be mistaken of Xia Ke and I.

671
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,620
We always get on well with each other.

672
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,220
Let's go.

673
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,940
You still don't want to tell her
what happened in TIG, right?

674
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,500
What do you mean?

675
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,740
How long haven't you logged
in the games of your company?

676
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,640
(Server closing announcement)

677
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,780
As a founding member of TIG,

678
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,220
your resign has had

679
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,660
a bad effect on the company,

680
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,300
making the staff anxious and panic.

681
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,060
After you resigned,

682
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,420
Xia Ke terminated the contract with the investor.

683
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,620
The server of games had to be closed.

684
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,140
At present, TIG

685
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,060
is striving hard to maintain its operation.

686
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,260
There were so serious things
happening in the company.

687
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,420
Why didn't you tell me?

688
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,340
The Infinite is our painstaking effort,

689
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,460
which has proved the achievements of TIG
for the last two years.

690
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,620
Why did you close the server?

691
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,380
No matter how difficult it is,

692
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,700
we can overcome it together.

693
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,340
I will always help TIG out.

694
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,580
What do you mean?

695
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,300
I am going to resume my post.

696
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,980
I will live and die with the company.

697
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,060
Ask He Yu to pick you up.

698
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,060
I don't have time to play with you.

699
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,100
He is not my boyfriend.

700
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,180
He is not my boyfriend.

701
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,180
You didn't agree me to resign,

702
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,020
so we pretended to be lovers to persuade you.

703
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,820
So

704
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,940
you lied to me with him, right?

705
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,340
I thought as long as I left TIG,

706
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,980
our company could get the invest money successfully.

707
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,860
Unexpectedly,

708
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,140
it became such a condition.

709
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,420
Let me back, ok?

710
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,860
During these days,

711
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,220
I've been persuading myself that

712
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,020
this is the life I want.

713
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,460
I have more time to do private tasks

714
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,620
which are low-required with high prices.

715
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,300
I can wake up naturally.

716
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,500
At weekends, I have time
to teach little kids to paint.

717
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,900
But do you know ?

718
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,700
Several days ago,

719
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,220
I carried my bag to crowd into a bus.

720
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,340
Not until two stations had passed

721
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,100
did I realize that I had resigned.

722
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,940
This is the third time in this month.

723
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,100
At first, I didn't want to admit

724
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,140
why I did so.

725
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,140
But now I know the reason.

726
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,540
I really want to go back to work in the company.

727
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,820
I really miss the company

728
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,980
and workmates very much.

729
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,780
What's more,

730
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,140
I even miss you very much!
