=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,860
=Episode 1=

3
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,420
A cup of espresso please.

4
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,660
Mr. Xia, your schedule for today is as follows:

5
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,300
9am, Teleconference;

6
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,380
10am, monthly report by the Planning Department;

7
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,060
12pm, lunch meeting with technical directors,

8
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,740
and Mr. Chen of the advertising company

9
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,260
has made an appointment with you
on the race course at 2pm.

10
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,060
I see.

11
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,980
Mr. Xia, are you going to take her with you?

12
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,220
Of course.

13
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,180
Take care on the road.

14
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,500
Your phone is ringing.

15
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,860
Thank you, madam.

16
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,560
(Reply at once)

17
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,740
Hello, Mr. Xia.

18
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,460
Where are you?

19
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,020
I'm near the company.

20
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,540
Come over right now.

21
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,900
Here it goes again.

22
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,700
Excuse me, would you move aside please?

23
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
Well, who are you?

24
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,260
Mr. Xia.

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,260
Mr. Xia, I drove into your car carelessly.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,900
Shall I buy you a cup of coffee?

27
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,820
Mr. Xia, you see,

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,420
we go to work in the same building,

29
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,700
and I drove into your car today,

30
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
which is kind of a predestined bond.

31
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,340
Or

32
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,060
shall we do it this way, Mr. Xia?

33
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,820
Miss,

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,980
he's my boss.

35
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,780
You can talk about things related to the car with me.

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,700
What can I say to you?

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,820
It's not your car.

38
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,180
You are his employee, so you should have his number.

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,700
Do it this way. Give his number to me,

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,860
and I'll contact him myself.

41
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,740
Judging from the position of collision,
you should bear full responsibility for it.

42
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,220
The paint here has been scraped off,

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,700
and the reflector has to be changed as well.

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,100
How would you like to deal with it?

45
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,100
We'll report to the police
if you'd like to go through insurance.

46
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,420
If you'd like to settle it privately,

47
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,300
it'll cost at least 10,000 yuan to repair the car.

48
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,780
10,000 yuan?

49
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Besides, this does not include

50
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,140
the loss of delaying my boss' use
of the car during the repair.

51
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,940
I don't think

52
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,660
he'll fuss about this with me.

53
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,380
Maybe it'll be OK if I buy him a cup of coffee.

54
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,460
He can't be so vulgar, can he?

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,380
Just a moment, just a moment.

56
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,140
Just a moment.

57
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,900
Mr. Xia. Thanks, Mr. Xia.

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,420
Mr. Xia, haven't you gone upstairs yet?

59
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,860
Oh, by the way, I've settled the collision accident.

60
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,940
Well, Mr. Xia,

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,580
actually when it comes to cars,

62
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,940
you can directly ask people in the Admin Department

63
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,340
or other male colleagues next time.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,540
They know more about cars than I do.

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,740
You are near.

66
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
You are right.

67
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm Xing Yun, and my English name is Lucky.

68
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm 24 this year.

69
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,660
The man beside me is my boss Xia Ke,

70
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,860
CEO of TIG, a famous mobile game company.

71
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
There is a lot to like about him.

72
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,380
For example, he has a discerning eye for talent
and is good at choosing the right persons for jobs.

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,420
Xing Yun, that's a lucky name.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,980
You're the one.

75
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,420
Please.

76
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,460
He's very affable

77
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,860
and often invites employees to his home.

78
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,900
Don't go out if you can't
finish modifying the sketches.

79
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,060
Mr. Xia!

80
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,940
Mr. Xia, I've got to go to the bathroom.

81
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,380
He shows solicitude and consideration for his employees.

82
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,220
Mr. Xia, why is it all spicy food?

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Dip it in water before eating.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,340
Morning, Mr. Xia.

85
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,020
Morning.

86
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:30,580
Morning, Mr. Xia.

87
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,860
He has good temper and never throws a fit.

88
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,460
Mr. Xia, this is the latest modified version
of character setting.

89
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,900
Do it again!

90
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,620
OK. I'll modify it now.

91
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,220
All right. I'll take this one back.

92
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,180
Morning, Xing Yun.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,780
Morning.

94
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,380
In any case, over the past two years,

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,940
TIG has created

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,500
an industry-wide phenomenal game
Infinite Unknown Love

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,180
and become the most promising mobile game company
in the industry.

98
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,060
Xia Ke is a once-in-a-lifetime genius boss,

99
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,300
and for us employees who are on board

100
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,500
the express cruise liner en route
to our ambitions,

101
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,020
what justification do we have
to complain about him?

102
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,580
Morning.

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,220
Morning.

104
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,980
Magnitude-7 earthquake, isn't it?

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,580
The targets are all from
your Planning Department.

106
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,100
I reckon he's not happy with the plan
for instance zones again.

107
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,420
Instance zones? Has the development
of instance zones kicked off at last?

108
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,460
Yes.

109
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,860
Mr. Xia pays special attention to
the development of instance zones this time,

110
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,060
but there has been little progress all along.

111
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,860
I heard they'll start
a company-wide competitive selection

112
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,140
if there are still no good plans.

113
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,940
What does it mean?

114
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
Whoever in the company can make good suggestions

115
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,780
can take charge of this plan.

116
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,940
Even a cleaning lady has a chance.

117
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,940
Xing Yun, what are you thinking?

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,660
I was thinking if I'll stand a chance.

119
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,900
Aren't you always interested in

120
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,020
game design and planning?

121
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,820
Give it a try.

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
If you can take charge of planning
for the instance zones,

123
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,220
your pay will be doubled.

124
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,580
But I'm just a small-time original animation artist.

125
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,860
There are so many capable people in the company.
Can it be my turn?

126
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,540
You are the first employee of TIG,

127
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,900
his meritorious courtier, his comrade-in-arms!

128
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,820
He's here, he's here. Look!

129
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,620
Look, he's so handsome!

130
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,900
So manly!

131
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,140
Be my boyfriend.

132
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,860
True enough.

133
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,180
Wake up, girls.

134
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
Nowadays there are no princes and knights.

135
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
There is only one kind of man
who rides a white horse -

136
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,100
a beast dressed in human clothes.

137
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,140
You are the most handsome, boss.

138
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,260
Which one would you like,
iced sweet-sour plum juice or coffee?

139
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,020
This one.

140
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,460
Mr. Xia,

141
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,740
let's find a time to sign the contract.

142
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,620
Mr. Chen, let me do some math for you.

143
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,940
I've seen the ads for

144
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,580
your VR game device.

145
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,620
For the social platform you've chosen
for advertising placement,

146
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,980
active male users account for 48% of the total,

147
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,540
of which men aged between 20-40

148
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
account for about 60%.

149
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,300
And of those, no more than 20%

150
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,420
would really spend 3,000 yuan

151
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,460
on a VR device,

152
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,140
so your probability of reaching actual buyers
can only come to

153
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,020
57.6% of your expected value,

154
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,420
even below the passing mark.

155
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,660
From what I can see
in your company's advertising placement,

156
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,900
I think you should lower your quoted price

157
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,220
by around 15%.

158
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,860
You are really a sharp-nosed man, Mr. Xia.

159
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,380
I never set my eyes on stunts.

160
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,220
Take choosing a horse for example.

161
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,100
The horse I choose may not have shiny hair

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,980
or outstanding appearance,

163
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,300
but I can see

164
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,500
the tenacious, unyielding characters in it,

165
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
and it can always help me win a race.

166
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,420
OK.

167
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,300
I can't convince you, Mr. Xia.

168
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,140
Let's do it this way.
Ride on your unyielding horse

169
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,060
and race with me on the racetrack.

170
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,500
The winner will have the final say.
What do you think?

171
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,340
Alas,

172
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,340
Mr. Xia, my horse is not in a good condition today.

173
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,420
I'm willing to throw in the towel.

174
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
I'll have the contract sent to you tomorrow.

175
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,060
I've got things to do later.

176
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,260
Let's make an appointment some other day.

177
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,180
OK.

178
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,940
Bye.

179
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,340
Mr. Xia, you really have a heroic bearing
and a flair for both the pen and the sword.

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,180
Mr. Chen is so slippery.

181
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,500
It's plain as day
that he has quoted an unreasonable price,

182
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,380
but he's only willing to reduce it
after making a bet with us.

183
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,900
It's a pity that he's not good at choosing horses.

184
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,140
Mr. Xia,

185
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,060
I heard the instance zones project
for Infinite Unknown Love is about to kick off

186
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,700
and you are going to have
a company-wide competitive selection for ideas.

187
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,540
Is it true?

188
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,300
What do you mean?

189
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
Actually I've

190
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,740
been taking courses in game design.

191
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,580
I'm very interested in this project.

192
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,700
I've drawn up a draft plan.

193
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Let me get it for you.

194
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,260
Do you have to

195
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
save me with such an idol drama-style posture?

196
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,900
Don't you watch where you are going?

197
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,340
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

198
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,380
Could it be his confession of love next?

199
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,420
You are my little lucky star which can only
be found by serendipity,

200
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,580
of course I'll protect you at all costs.

201
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,300
Mr. Xia.

202
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,660
Ah!

203
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,540
Have you ever been in a relationship?

204
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,700
Ah?

205
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,380
Aren't you asking while knowing the answer?

206
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,700
You are going beyond your depth!

207
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,660
Well, what has whether I've been
in a relationship or not

208
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
to do with my work?

209
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,140
I have a strong feeling about this game,

210
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,100
I can give all my time

211
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,340
to this game,

212
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,860
I think...

213
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,260
If you want to do the instance zones of the game,

214
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,180
firstly, you must find a man
who's willing to date you.

215
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,820
Ah?

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,620
Isn't it just dating?

217
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,020
What's great about it?

218
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,700
Wrong password.

219
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,260
What's Xing Yun's password?

220
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,860
3732.

221
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Wrong password.

222
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,500
Xing Yun, 373258.

223
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,700
Yes, yes, yes, it's this one.

224
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,380
373258.

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,380
Thanks.

226
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,060
Thanks...

227
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,460
Mr. Xia.

228
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,500
Where has she gone?

229
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,860
She... she was not feeling well,
so she went home first.

230
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,140
By the way, what is the company's regulation for

231
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,260
clocking in and out for others?

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,980
Ah?

233
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,220
Deduct 1 month bonus.

234
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,900
Don't do that, Mr. Xia, just this once.

235
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,540
Make it dock the year-end bonus.

236
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,140
No, no, no.

237
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
Xing Yun is going on a blind date.

238
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,100
With a young talent who works for a bank

239
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,420
and was introduced to her by her older cousin sister
upon her mother's request.

240
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,780
This is all I know.

241
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,740
Mr. Xia, be sure not to dock my year-end bonus.

242
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,060
I'll never dare to do it again next time.

243
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,580
A blind date?

244
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,380
Is she really going?

245
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Miss Xing Cheng,
you've been nagging all the way.

246
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,500
Haven't I told you?

247
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,860
I promised to go on a blind date
simply for the sake of...

248
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,220
work.

249
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Are you Xing Yun?

250
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,340
Hello, I'm Chu Nan.

251
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,060
Hello.

252
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,260
What would you like to drink?

253
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
You needn't. I can buy one for myself.

254
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,220
Let's give a formal introduction of ourselves.

255
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,980
My name is Chu Nan. Nan as in Nanmu phoebe.

256
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,660
My name is Xing Yun, yun for luck.

257
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,180
A very pleasant name.

258
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,340
Thanks.

259
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,020
Are you a native here?

260
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,580
What about you?

261
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,340
My ancestral hometown is Sichuan.

262
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,700
Sichuan abounds in Nanmu phoebe, do you know?

263
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,860
My grandfather is a Sichuan native,

264
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,900
also a carpenter.

265
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,060
That's why he gave me this name.

266
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,660
A very pleasant name.

267
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,940
You are the first one to give such a response

268
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,140
upon hearing my name.

269
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,380
Why?

270
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,420
How do others respond then?

271
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,500
You'd better not know.

272
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,780
But I like your response very much.

273
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,460
I suppose Xing Cheng has told you about me, hasn't she?

274
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm usually very busy with my work,

275
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,660
so going on a blind date

276
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,060
is the most straightforward,
simple and effective way for me.

277
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,260
What about you?

278
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,540
How did you come to think of
going on a blind date at such a young age?

279
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,900
Me?

280
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,420
It's also because...
I'm too busy with my work,

281
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,740
so I'd like to know some new friends, same as you.

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,540
(Reply at once)

283
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
What's your hobby?

284
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,420
I like watching anime.

285
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,940
You... you still retain a childlike heart.

286
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,540
What do you like?

287
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,380
Soccer.

288
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,940
Soccer?

289
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,580
I really can't see that in you.

290
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
I like watching it.

291
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,180
(Reply at once)

292
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,020
Actually I like travelling a lot.

293
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,620
(Reply at once)
Do you like it?

294
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,980
You'd better pick it up.

295
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,580
You don't have to think about me.

296
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,220
The caller must want to speak to you
about something urgent.

297
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,340
I'm sorry, it's my boss.

298
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,740
Maybe it's really something urgent.

299
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,740
You dared to hang up on me!

300
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,380
Mr. Xia, can I ask what it's regarding?

301
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,100
Come back to modify the CG.

302
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,940
But...

303
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,140
Can I come back a while later?

304
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,780
There's no time.

305
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,100
Are you in such a rush?

306
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,020
When I get things done here...

307
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,380
I tell you what, come back right now.

308
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,580
The data planner is waiting.

309
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,860
OK, I see.

310
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,780
I'll say yes first,

311
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,740
and put off for as long as I can.

312
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll give you a maximum of ten minutes.

313
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,500
I see.

314
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,220
Let's go.

315
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,780
Don't you have work to do?

316
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,300
Let me give you a ride there.

317
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,780
I'm really sorry.

318
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,660
It's OK. Work is more important.

319
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,460
We can talk again next time.

320
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,660
When will Mr. Sun get here?

321
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,620
Oh,

322
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,100
my older brother is already on the way.

323
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,220
Shall we order first?

324
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,140
Mr. Xia, you look restless since you came back

325
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,700
from making a call outside just now.

326
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,900
Is anything wrong with your company?

327
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,660
There's no harm in telling it to me.

328
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm really sorry

329
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,340
for troubling you to send me here.

330
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,060
Next time...

331
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,060
If you are not so busy next time,

332
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,100
take some time out to have dinner with me.

333
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,660
Ah?

334
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,580
I think we are a good match.

335
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,420
I want to go further, can I?

336
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,300
It's OK if you say no.

337
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,340
Take it easy.

338
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,740
I didn't say no.

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,900
No, that's not what I meant.

340
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,180
I mean...

341
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,500
I see.

342
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,420
All right. Be quick to go upstairs.

343
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,660
Let's get in touch by phone tonight.

344
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,940
OK. Watch out for your safety.

345
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,300
My company adopted a stray cat before,

346
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,180
but it becomes fun-loving now,

347
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,620
and even brings other cats.

348
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,900
Stray cats don't support a family indeed.

349
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,060
But you don't have to

350
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,020
be bothered by such a trifle.

351
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,260
Mr. Xia, I'm in the company.

352
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,540
It supports the family very well.

353
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,100
It not only brings wealth, but also works hard.

354
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:56,980
It's like this.

355
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,620
If it brings other cats,

356
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,300
it'll surely be more fun-loving,

357
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,500
and will even bring a bunch of companions later.

358
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Mr. Xia, I'm afraid

359
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,740
I really can't help you with this.

360
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,640
(Shen Qing requests FaceTime)

361
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,740
Uh.

362
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,780
Excuse me.

363
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,860
It's OK, just answer it here.

364
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,380
Surprise!

365
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,260
We haven't met for ages. Did you miss me?

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,820
What's the matter?

367
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,580
What are you doing?

368
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,100
I firstly thought I was arranged
to be at a business banquet,

369
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,460
but now it seems to be a blind date.

370
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,900
With whom? Let me have a look.

371
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,540
Hello, my surname is Sun.

372
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,660
The makeup on your eyelashes got messed up.

373
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,060
And the color of your lipstick
doesn't quite suit you.

374
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,180
Are you talking about yourself, older sister?

375
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,980
He tortured me like hell.

376
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,260
Ask him if you don't believe me.

377
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,980
Mr. Xia, let me tell you.

378
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,140
My older brother will not come.

379
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
I thought you were a diamond bachelor
(outstanding, rare single man).

380
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,380
Little did I think you are

381
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,820
a nasty jerk who still has connections with his ex!

382
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,300
I'm off.

383
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,860
What's more, I don't like cats.

384
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,380
Well, older sister, are you done with your mischief?

385
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,260
Come to pick me up at the airport next Tuesday.

386
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,340
I'll send the flight number to your cell phone.

387
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,580
Bye bye.

A never-ending date...

391
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,220
If you are not so busy next time,

392
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,020
take some time out to have dinner with me.

393
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,740
Ah?

394
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,500
I think we are a good match.

395
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,380
I want to go further, can I?

396
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,740
Is this dating?

397
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,260
It turns out dating is so easy.

398
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,940
Will I become like Vivian

399
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,140
and Maggie later on?

400
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,060
He's so annoying.

401
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,820
I've told him I'm very busy every day,

402
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,980
but he insists on seeing me every day.

403
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
My boyfriend is the same.

404
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,740
He brings me breakfast every day.

405
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,780
So annoying!

406
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,220
I could have worn no makeup,

407
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,700
but now I put on makeup
at least one hour earlier every day.

408

Sorry, I was blind,

411
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,060
I insulted you

412
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,460
by saying no man would date you

413
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,820
and I overestimated myself.

414
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,300
I hope you can participate in

Ah... Why are you guys here?

422
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,980
Mr. Xia asked us to stay for overtime.

423
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,500
Why did you come back?

424
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,060
I... I'm waiting for Mr. Xia and the data planner.

425
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,220
He said the details of a few CGs need to be modified.

426

Whom are you waiting for?

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,380
Did you get it wrong?

428
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,500
Mr. Xia left as soon as he finished work.

429
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,380
There is no such thing.

430
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,300
How can that be?

431
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,980
I see.

432
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,580
Mr. Xia must be unhappy about your leaving early

433
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,380
and my clocking out for you,

434
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,340
so he was screwing you over on purpose.

Ha,

436
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,300
so I've been waiting for an hour in vain?

437
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,460
All right. Be quick to tidy up your things

438

OK.

446
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,580
All right, Xing Yun, don't be mad.

447
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,300
You are bringing trouble to yourself
and digging your own grave

448
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
by getting up to little tricks under Mr. Xia's nose.

449
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,260
Well, how can he be so childish

450
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,620
as a boss?

451
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,780
This won't do. I'm gonna call him.

I'm in the company.

455
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,740
I know.

456
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,740
So could you tell me where you are?

457
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,420
I'm almost there.

458
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,060
Can you stop fooling me?

459
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,420
How long do you want to keep me waiting here?

460
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,900
Yiyi and others said
there is no such thing at all.

461
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,500
The data planner has got off work hours ago.

462
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,780
She's sold you out.

463
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,100
Yes, I was wrong to leave early.

464
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,340
You can deduct my pay.

465
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,820
Don't you think you
are going overboard by doing so?

466
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,780
Why are you in such a rage?

467
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,500
Is it because your blind date failed?

468
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,180
You screwed me over on purpose
while knowing I went on a blind date?

469
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm sorry to let you down.

470
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,420
I solemnly announce to you

471
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,660
that I have absolute confidence

472
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,540
to take up the challenge
of planning the dating instance zones,

473
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,260
because I am in a relationship!

474
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,780
Is this true, Xing Yun? Is this true?

475
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,540
You are quite something, Xing Yun.

476
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,460
What's going on? What's going on?

477
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,060
Drink, drink, drink!

478
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,180
Drink!

479
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,340

00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
This is for you.

483
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,140
You... know actually I don't quite like

484
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,260
gifts of this size.

485
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,340
What do you think it is?

486
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,340
Have a look.

487
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,300

to come for a visit at any time.

489
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,660
we've been together for a week, haven't we?

490
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,660
It will have been eight days

491
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,860
by 11pm tonight.

492
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,140
No wonder.

493
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,300
No wonder what?

494
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,820
It took God only seven days

495
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,620
to create this colorful world.

496
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,420
Even the best relationship

497
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,860
will fade away by the eighth day.

498
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,540
Why do you suddenly talk about God?

499
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,620

500
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,260

503
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,900
Director Qian asked him to stay and modify a plan.

504
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,300
He asked me to come and drive you home.

505
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,780
How boring it is to go home on such a day!

506
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,780
Give me your cellphone.

507
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,300
Drive me here.

508
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:35,900

Is your girlfriend there?

511
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,180
He's more important than a girlfriend.

512
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,020

Why are you here?

524

We are on such good terms,

525
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,260
can't I even crack your password?

526
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,380
Where are you going?

527
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,340
I'm gonna call security guards.

531
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,900
I was drunk last night.

532
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,980
I was near your place,

533
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,620
so I asked my friend to drive me here.

534
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,980
But I assure you,

535
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,460
I swear with my 28

537
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
that I certainly didn't throw up in your house.

538
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,180
Wasn't it 26 last month?

539
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Life is short, why make do with what you have?

540
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,580
Well,

541
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,980
I heard it from Joey that

542
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,580
a personable CEO

543
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,540
and a belle

544
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,740
dined at a western-style restaurant
commonly hailed as "The Holy Land for Dating",

545
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,100
don't you think he was blind?

546
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,140
I think you can piss off.

547
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Was it really you?

548
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,340
Is she the first girl to your liking

549
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,580
after Zhang Rui?

550
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,860
Why didn't you bring her home last night?

551
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,980
Hey hey hey...

552
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,620
Older brother, older brother, older brother...

553
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,060
I've really got proper business.

554
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,020
I'm seeking your partnership.

555
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,060
I'm not interested.

556
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,820
Knock it off.

557
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,940
Our Jiawo

558
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,340
is an industry leader anyway,

559
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,140
and your TIG is a darling of the new media,

560
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,940
our partnership will bring out the best in each other.

561
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,900
I heard you are going to start

562
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,060
a new instance zones project.

563
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,460
Join us to test the water.

564
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,780
Don't you happen to be unhappy with

565
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,500
the advertising company you are working with?

566
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,020
I don't like to have dealings with

567
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,260
a man whose mind is occupied with hormone.

568
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,140
Ho,

569
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,780
there's something wrong with your mentality.

570
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
It seems your date last night

571
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,500
didn't go very well.

572
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,380
Mr. Xia, think it over.

573
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,260
I am single now.

574
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,460
I just broke up with

575
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,780
my 28th girlfriend last night.

576
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,860
As soon as I'm back at the company,

577
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,860
I'll set up a singletons' project department

578
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
to serve you exclusively.

579
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,660
I'll nip all my time for dating

580
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,020
in the bud.

581
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,780
Do you think this is OK?

582
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,860
Hey hey hey, what are you doing?

583
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,180
Hey.

584
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,980
This doesn't work. I know the password for your house.

585
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,420
Hey!

586
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,860
Hey!

587
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,580
Why did you lock it from inside?

588
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,900
I... I've left my stuff inside.

589
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,460
Open the door, hey!

590
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,860
Good morning, everybody.

591
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,100
I am Xing Yun from the Arts Unit.

592
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,860
In the following, I'm going to introduce my plan to you.

593
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,780
Please look at the screen.

594
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,260
The first part is on storyline.

595
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,620
We will enable full-range rendering
and interactive experiences

596
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,940
for the artistic scenes of character setting storyline

597
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,300
in terms of storyline experience interactive system

598
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,420
and suspense elements.

599
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,540
Next is the second part.

600
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,100
In terms of interaction,
it is comments-oriented upgraded interaction.

601
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,140
It generally takes two to three hours.

602
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,220
Would you like a five-minute break?

603
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,580
It's only 30 minutes for everyone.

604
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,980
Are you sure you want a break?

605
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,220
Xing Yun, is it because you’re nervous?

606
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,820
It's OK.

607
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,100
These five minutes can be counted into my time.

608
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,220
Amy, could you please

609
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,340
make everyone a cup of coffee?

610
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,620
Oh, OK.

611
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,140
Xing Yun, shall we start?

612
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,060
OK.

613
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,300
Actually during the last few minutes of the break,

614
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,140
I found most of you were on your cellphones,

615
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,260
but only Dongdong, Director Wang and Mr. Xia

616
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,420
opened our game APP,

617
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
and the three of them opened other software

618
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,060
after no more than six interactive actions.

619
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,340
So?

620
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,900
I've done some research recently,

621
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,860
and found that more than 40% users would

622
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,060
open game APPs during the fragmented time

623
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,820
of coffee break, waiting for people

624
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,620
or riding the subway.

625
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,940
Although my sample size is small,

626
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,620
it can still shed light on something.

627
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,420
Hello, handsome young man,

628
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,380
could you tell me

629
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,180
during what hours you usually play games?

630
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,020
As you have experienced just now,

631
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,980
our current game storyline development

632
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,860
is elaborate

633
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,260
and needs a whole chunk of time for immersion.

634
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,740
There is a lack of modules that can

635
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,820
make full use of fragmented time.

636
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,940
Even if players enter our game

637
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,980
in their free time,

638
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,100
they have to leave

639
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,900
after about six interactive actions.

640
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,340
Therefore, the most important feature

641
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,140
of my plan is additions of

642
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,300
one-minute and five-minute modules

643
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,100
which I think can also

644
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,140
increase user stickiness.

645
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,460
So the above is my plan.

646
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:21,980
Thank you.

647
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,700
I heard you went on a blind date for this project?

648
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,340
Even if it doesn't work out in the end,

649
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,740
you can still have a handsome boyfriend,

650
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,380
which ends well, isn't it?

651
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,060
Hey,

652
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,540
Xing Yun, how's it going?

653
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,420
I suppose it's all right.

654
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,700
Director Wang and Director Li also praised me,

655
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,260
but Mr. Xia didn't seem to have any response.

656
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,660
As I see it, only you take it seriously.

657
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,500
There is no precedent of competitive selection
in the game industry.

658
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,380
As I see it, this is just a stunt

659
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,060
with which Mr. Xia

660
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,180
intends to goad our Planning Department into action.

661
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,900
Really?

662
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,580
But isn't this too much?

663
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,140
He also says even cleaning ladies can be hired
as long as they have good plans.

664
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,340
Untrustworthy jerk, black-hearted businessman!

665
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,060
It's OK he jerked me around before,

666
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,580
now he's jerking

667
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,860
all the company's ambitious people around!

668
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,060
For the sake of this competitive selection,

669
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,100
I only slept a few hours in the past few days.

670
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,620
A pervert with evil tastes!

671
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,140
I... I... I... I was talking about the boss
on the fourth floor.

672
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,260
He's really a pervert, isn't he?

673
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,380
Unlike our Mr. Xia

674
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,380
who has attractive appearance and deep pockets.

675
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,100
Mr. Xia, you've finished the meeting?

676
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,780
Xing Yun, come to my office.

677
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:53,940
Hey hey,

678
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
breaking news!

679
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,220
Where's Xing... Xing Yun?

680
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,420
Where's Xing Yun? Where's Xing Yun?

681
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,940
I'm afraid she's about to be a dead duck.

682
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,060
Why is she going to be a dead duck?

683
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,140
What do you mean?

684
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,060
Do you have any other complaints? Go ahead.

685
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Actually when I calm down and think about it,
I instantly saw that

686
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,140
you are putting us through an ordeal.

687
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,980
It doesn't matter whether our plans work out or not;

688
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,460
what matters is we've learnt and grown up

689
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,820
during the process.

690
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,180
Mr. Xia, you have given much thought to it indeed.

691
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,340
Hand over your work at the Arts Unit to Maggie.

692
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Xia, it's really my fault.

693
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,900
Please show magnanimity
and just forgive me this once.

694
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,700
I am the No.1 employee of the company after all,

695
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,860
and I'm loyal to you and to TIG.

696
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,580
I should be given credit for hard work,
if not for merit.

697
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,460
It's OK if you don't want to hand over your work.

698
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,020
Just give the instance zones work to others.

699
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,740
What?

700
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,460
Do you mean I've been selected?

701
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Modify and refine your plan.

702
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,660
You are not allowed to take a leave
in the next three months.

703
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
Modify it until I'm satisfied.

704
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,100
Uh, uh, uh.

705
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,380
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

706
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,460
Hahahahaha...

707
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,700
Well,

708
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,740
isn't this a graffiti

709
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,780
of your company's game?

710
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,660
It has a bit of creativity.

711
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,220
Ah, it has become a popular tourist attraction
going viral online.

712
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,380
But

713
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,620
with our Jiawo's support in the publicity
of your instance zones this time,

714
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm sure it'll be more popular than it is now.

715
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,220
By the way,

716
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,340
have you selected the chief planner?

717
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,100
For someone who's able to fight his way
out of the competitive selection,

718
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,500
what's his background?

719
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,980
How shall I put it?

720
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,100
It's very special indeed. It's worth the wait.

721
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,500
(Chu Nan...)

722
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,500
(Movie reservation: The God of Games)

723
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
Mr. Xia, you have a meeting

724
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,900
with the investors at 3pm this afternoon.

725
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,460
By the way, the team-building activity
this month is movie watching.

726
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,580
The Admin Department asked me to ask you

727
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,460
if there is a movie you particularly would like to watch.

728
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,300
The God of Games.

729
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,100
The God of Games, I see.

730
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,140
Mr. Xia, I'm off.

731
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:58,980
Come in.

732
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,740
Mr. Xia, do you want to see me?

733
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,940
You've finished reading it so soon?

734
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,460
What do you think?

735
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,660
A love game has no vibe of being in love.

736
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,780
What do you think it's like?

737
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,460
Mr. Xia, can you be a bit more specific?

738
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,980
It's the third time already.

739
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,340
What kind of vibe of being in love do you want?

740
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,820
I remember you've just announced
you are in a relationship.

741
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,140
Why? You've been dumped?

742
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,700
Alas,

743
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,020
I have no idea either.

744
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,580
Actually my relationship

745
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,100
seems to be in a different state from others'.

746
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,620
On the day of the blind date,
he made it clear to me that

747
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,460
we are a good match
and he wants to give it a try.

748
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
But after such a long time,

749
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,180
he didn't even give me a call or a text message.

750
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
I wanted to ask him to a movie,

751
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,380
but thought he should ask me first

752
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,700
for such a thing.

753
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,380
Mr. Xia, how did you

754
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,580
go steady with your girlfriend before?

755
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,420
Sorry, I'm talking too much.

756
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,980
I'll modify it again right away.

757
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,980
Wait a minute.

758
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,260
Let me borrow your cellphone for a moment.

759
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,540
Ah?

760
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,020
Be quick.

761
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,060
Oh.

762
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
(Reply at once)

763
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,940
Reply at once?

764
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,220
Hahaha...

765
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,220
This CN is him, right?

766
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,740
Uh.

767
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,060
Hey!

768
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,180
What... what... what are you typing?

769
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,940
Don't, don't, don't do that!
What are you writing?

770
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,380
Give it back to me! Don't write nonsense!

771
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,940
Hey, Mr. Xia, give it back to me,
give it back to me!

772
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,740
(I want to watch a movie.
When are you available?)

773
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,220
Hey!

774
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,900
Give it back to me, hey!

775
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,380
Why didn't you even put in punctuations?

776
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,260
I hate my employees

777
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,660
working in a distraught state.

778
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,300
What time do you finish work?
I'll go and pick you up.

779
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,900
He said yes?

780
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,740
Mr. Xia, turns out it is different
once you take up the matter.

781
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,820
Thank you.

782
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,380
I'll take it with me.

783
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,740
Hee-hee, hee-hee.

784
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,020
Playing hard-to-get?

785
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,180
He turns out to be an experienced lady's man indeed.

786
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,700
Gee whiz,

787
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,980
nice car!

788
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,500
Is it the man beside the car?

789
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,380
But don't you think he's slightly subpar

790
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
compared with Mr. Xia?

791
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,060
It's normal to be subpar, OK?

792
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,980
I tell you what,

793
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,180
if given Mr. Xia's qualities,

794
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,180
he still goes on a blind date,

795
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,460
eight or nine out of ten times
it'll be a marriage by cheating.

796
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,060
Not necessarily.

797
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,620
Didn't he go on a blind date
with Mr. Sun's younger sister some time ago?

798
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,860
Was it true?

799
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,060
I thought someone like him
who is a 100% control freak

800
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,900
would never go on a blind date
under other's arrangement.

801
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,140
Little did I think he did go.

802
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,340
She's the investor's younger sister anyway,

803
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,020
he had to show respect.

804
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,420
His longstanding good man image has collapsed.

805
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,060
It's sad that I adored him all the time.

806
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,780
I didn't expect he's a man like this.

807
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,500
I didn't expect I'm a man like this as well.

808
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,940
Mr. Xia, haven't you got off work
at such a late hour?

809
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,780
I came to buy water.

810
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,540
It's good to buy water.

811
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,100
Drinking plenty of water is good
for your health, isn't it?

812
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,340
We should also drink plenty of water,

813
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,980
but this store has sold out of water.

814
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,820
What shall we do?

815
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,580
Let's go to another store then.

816
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,180
Goodbye, Mr. Xia.

817
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,660
Come back.

818
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,420
Is that guy Xing Yun's boyfriend?

819
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,260
Yes, what do you think?

820
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,140
Isn't he a good looking guy?

821
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
What's going on?
