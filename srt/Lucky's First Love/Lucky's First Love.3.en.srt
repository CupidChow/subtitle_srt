00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,620
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me tell you a secret.

4
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
My first girlfriend

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,010
was a kendo coach.

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,650
So I am quite experienced at this.

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,540
Did you often help her with this?

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,270
I helped myself.

9
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,160
Ah?

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,120
You mustn't tell anyone else
or your annual bonus will be canceled.

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,940
Mr. Xia, can you practice kendo?

12
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,960
A little bit.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
Do you know any move

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
that can give bad guys a deadly blow?

15
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,910
If you want to defeat bad guys at a time,

16
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,600
I suppose the best move
is to kick their crotches

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
and play it by ear afterwards.

18
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,440
I see.

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,120
When... did you shower last time?

20
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,480
I... I have a shower every day.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
Then what's this?

22
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,610
Ju... just sweat, okay?

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,800
How can people not sweat

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
after running on mud all day
and struggling to survive?

25
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
Gift on the first meeting?

26
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,880
How did you know?

27
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,580
Mr. Xia, since you're well informed,

28
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,700
can you have another look

29
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,670
and tell me whether this bracelet
is expensive or not?

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Not valuable at all.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,760
As cheap as a scooter.

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Really?

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,700
Hurry up.

34
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,560
It hurts.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,290
Oh.

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,640
Are you okay?

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm fine.

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,650
Mr. Xia... I'm sorry.

39
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,500
Are you okay?

40
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
Sorry.

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,800
I wasn't on purpose.

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,440
Fine, I'll wear it
since we can't take it off.

43
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,420
Can I take a shower?

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,570
As you wish.

45
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Put it on after the shower.

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,430
Woman's clothes.

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,400
Your girlfriend's?

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,430
None of your business.

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,810
Just take it.

50
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,250
Be careful during the shower.

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,430
If you fall over because of your injured ankle,

52
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,640
I can't come in to help you.

53
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,200
Oh.

54
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

55
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,480
(Chu Nan, are you asleep? A lot happened today.
Forget it. I will tell you next time. Good night.)

56
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,600
Mr. Xia, don't bother.

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
It's okay for me to sleep in the guest room.

58
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,830
Is this truly your guest room?

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
There is nothing here.

60
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,180
Because I don't like other people
sleeping in my house.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
So where will you sleep?

62
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
On the sofa.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Well, I can sleep there.

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,760
Yeah. You sleep on the sofa.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,030
But at night, I usually

66
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,960
get up to drink some water or sleepwalk.

67
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,720
You'd better cover yourself up well.

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Slee... sleepwalk?

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,390
Fine. I'm injured.

70
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,960
Sorry to make you sleep on the sofa.

71
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,000
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
Wanna go to bed now.

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,440
There is a glass of hot milk near the bed.

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,160
Drink it before you go to sleep.

74
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

75
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,360
(Chu Nan, are you asleep? A lot happened today.
Forget it. I will tell you next time. Good night.)

76
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,030
Sorry Xing Yun.

77
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,950
I was watching a midnight movie with my husband

78
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,560
and missed your call.

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Are you all right?

80
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,700
How was your day?

81
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,910
It's a long story.

82
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
Sounds like something big happened.

83
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,620
By the way, I'll send you an article
of relationship advice

84
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,250
which is of great use to you at present.

85
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,220
It can help know better about him.

86
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,900
Let's talk about other details at the company.

87
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,640
Good night!

88
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,200
Relationship advice?

89
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Ten things you must check

90
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,160
during the first visit to your boyfriend's.

91
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,840
What?

92
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,910
His room

93
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,200
reveals his real personalities.

94
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,450
During the first visit to your boyfriend's,

95
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,350
you can sum up his life trajectory

96
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,750
from his bedroom.

97
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,760
A man's bedding reflects his moral quality?

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,420
After all, each person spends
1/3 of his or her life

99
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,000
staying in bed.

100
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,250
Therefore, the texture of his bedding
represents his moral quality

101
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
and patterns represent his taste.

102
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,060
How about the bedding

103
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,110
in a cold solid color and made of cotton?

104
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,460
Simple, tasteful and of high quality.

105
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,030
Congratulations! You chose the right man.

106
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,330
He isn't the person I chose, okay?

107
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,220
Next. The closet is the place

108
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,190
that hides a man's biggest secret of his life.

109
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,130
A man will do a spring-clean

110
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,440
before he invites his girlfriend to his house.

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,730
So only the cleanliness in his closet

112
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,650
can reflect what a person he truly is.

113
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,830
Of course, the clothes a man chooses

114
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,330
are also something worth studying.

115
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,090
If his closet is pretty empty,

116
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,920
this man is rigid and dull.

117
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,150
If his closet

118
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,640
is like a fashion week,

119
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,240
you need to take greater caution.

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,160
Paying so much attention to dress himself up,

121
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,360
he definitely not only aims at you.

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,280
Mr. Xia indeed has severe OCD.

123
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,580
His dressing style is well matched with him.

124
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,780
Though here are only a few types of clothes,

125
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,940
all of them are high-end.

126
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,000
Congratulation again! You chose the right man.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,710
If you happen to see several books in his room,

128
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,130
no hurry to admire him.

129
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,370
Open the books to check they are for showing off

130
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,720
or for reading.

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,400
I prefer comic books.

132
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
Anyway, however perfect he is

133
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,720
up till now,

134
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,650
there is one most important thing

135
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,920
which can erase all of his perfection.

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
What's that?

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,310
Whether there are

138
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,690
woman's items in his room.

139
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,660
Even a strand of long hair

140
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,520
can overturn previous conclusions

141
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,320
and kick him out of your world at once.

142
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,660
No need to find. Look at what I wear.

143
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,860
I urge you to leave now.

144
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,680
Or you'll get involved in

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,840
a fierce and bloody fight.

146
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Are you kidding me?

147
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,720
Out of power?

148
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,000
What am I thinking about?

149
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
It's weird to sleep in boss's bed.

150
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Let it go. Let it go.

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,960
I'll leave right after getting up tomorrow.

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,600
On a sunny afternoon,

153
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,360
a handsome boy lies on a lawn.

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
Suddenly, he closes his book. Do you know why?

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,200
A. It's going to rain so he has to leave.

156
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,240
B. He wants to sleep.

157
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,240
C. He wants to read another book.

158
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,950
I choose B. He wants to sleep.

159
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,520
Then you are my Miss Right.

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Come on.

161
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
I understand.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
What you said is nonsense.

163
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
As long as you like it.

164
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,840
A man is like a book.

165
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,340
He can't understand himself.

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,000
Only women can.

167
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,810
Don't give up reading immediately

168
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,880
if the preface is obscure.

169
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,750
Read it several times.

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,550
Perhaps you will find out the treasure.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,120
Don't get immersed into it

172
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
if stories are full of ups and downs.

173
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,070
There are many

174
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,360
bad endings.

175
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,320
A smart woman needs to know

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
how to select a book at the same level
with her wisdom

177
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,840
so that she won't waste her time or youth.

178
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,920
When a woman happens to

179
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,600
open the book of me,

180
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,950
I will grab her,

181
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,560
make her keep reading

182
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,970
and finally station myself in her heart.

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,920
As to what the reader gets from this book,

184
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,000
it all depends on herself.

185
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,180
I really want to have a try.

186
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,640
Where are we going?

187
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,960
Wait...

188
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,980
Is... is there an earthquake?

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,020
Keep quiet.

190
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,630
Is he hiding from usurers?

191
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,890
Mr. Xia is so wealthy.

192
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,840
Can't imagine he is dunned for debts.

193
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,690
Oh my!

194
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,400
Will there be fierce-looking gangsters

195
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,120
later chopping the closet door?

196
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,600
How unlucky I am!

197
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,010
I just survived from some human traffickers.

198
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,960
Now I'm going to be killed by usurers.

199
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,200
What have you done!

200
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,120
I didn't dirty your hands on purpose.

201
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,090
I lick my lips when I'm nervous.

202
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,180
Shut up your mouth.

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,630
Mr. Xia, I can't bear it any more.

204
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,380
Keep bearing.

205
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,280
But my ankle really hurts.

206
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,820
You must bear it.

207
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,350
Hold still.

208
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,390
But I...

209
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,460
Why are you hiding here?

210
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,820
Xiaoxi, go to the living room to play.

211
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,580
Is this a new way to have fun?

212
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,010
Closet play?

213
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,840
Isn't this the lady I met
at that underwear store?

214
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,960
So embarrassing.

215
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,780
You misunderstood.

216
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,170
It's not what you think.

217
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,110
It's you.

218
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,920
It's really not what you think.

219
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,150
Right!

220
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,070
I ran into some accidents yesterday

221
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,180
and had no other choice
but to stay at Mr. Xia's.

222
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,880
Nothing happened between us.

223
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,120
Please trust Mr. Xia.

224
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,550
He is faithful to you.

225
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,240
You're not eligible to tell me how he treats me.

226
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,960
I...

227
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,840
You gave her my pajama?

228
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,200
Enough...

229
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,890
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,100
So what forced you to stay here?

231
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,840
Yesterday I truly ran into some accidents

232
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
which you might not believe.

233
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,810
I met human traffickers at first.

234
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,810
Then I sprained my ankle

235
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,240
and got my bag stolen.

236
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,010
Since my identification
and keys were all in that bag

237
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,100
and my parents happened to be on a journey,

238
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,710
Mr. Xia had no other choice but to take me here.

239
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,510
People who intend to ruin others' relationships

240
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,070
are born with accidents.

241
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,020
What on earth do you mean?

242
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,410
How can you speak for her!

243
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,310
If my memory serves me right,

244
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,620
you have a boyfriend, right?

245
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,150
Weren't you going
to meet your boyfriend yesterday?

246
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,840
Why did you run into accidents?

247
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,940
You didn't ask your boyfriend for help

248
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,960
but stayed overnight at another man's house.

249
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,580
Are relationships today

250
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,400
all casual like this?

251
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,320
My boyfriend...

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
Shen Qing, you shouldn't have taken it out on her.

253
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,290
Hurry up to prepare breakfast for your son.

254
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,400
Change the pajama.

255
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,470
Well,

256
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,010
enjoy yourself. I'll go back now.

257
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,550
Without breakfast?

258
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,230
I don't eat breakfast.

259
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,080
Miss, your stomach is growling.

260
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,710
Since nothing happened,

261
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,830
why don't you stay to have breakfast?

262
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,680
Just sit there and have breakfast,

263
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
or she won't stop.

264
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,530
Milk or coffee?

265
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,470
Both are okay.

266
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Thank you.

267
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
What brings you here today?

268
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,120
The nanny asked for leave today.

269
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,170
So Xiaoxi needs to stay at your home today.

270
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,120
Mr. Xia's illegitimate child?

271
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,310
He is so good-looking,

272
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,530
in which way he looks a bit like Mr. Xia.

273
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,110
Miss, why were you staring at me?

274
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,100
I... My eyes itch.

275
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,290
What's your job?

276
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm a original animation artist

277
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,720
and in charge of game planning now.

278
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,280
What does that mean?

279
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,660
I draw things.

280
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,590
Can you draw me a Peppa Pig?

281
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,200
No problem.

282
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,540
Peppa Pig.

283
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,150
I want Peppa Pig to eat breakfast.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,560
No problem.

285
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,130
Eat breakfast. Finished.

286
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,960
Peppa Pig swimming.

287
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,710
Finished.

288
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,370
Peppa Pig driving a tank.

289
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,640
Driving a tank.

290
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
Peppa Pig parachuting.

291
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,310
Here you are.

292
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm Xiaoxi. What's your name?

293
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,970
I'm Xing Yun.

294
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,570
You are really awesome, Miss Xing.

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,600
The bread tastes good.

296
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,940
Thanks for allowing me to stay, Mr. Xia.

297
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,540
Thanks for your breakfast, Miss Shen.

298
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,980
I've finished. Goodbye.

299
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,060
Don't give her a ride?

300
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,490
I can, but do you think she dares to get on?

301
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,590
It sounds like you are blaming me.

302
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
Now that you don't care about Chu Nan,

303
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,980
why are you so hostile to his girlfriend?

304
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,040
None of your business.

305
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,610
I like Miss Xing.

306
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,560
Xia Ke, is she your girlfriend?

307
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,830
Eat your breakfast. Stop talking nonsense.

308
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,920
I urge you to leave now.

309
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Or you'll get involved in

310
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,100
a fierce and bloody fight.

311
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,800
Far more than a fierce and bloody fight.

312
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,540
She even ate my bones up.

313
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,350
Get on!

314
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,430
No thanks.

315
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,830
It's a good day. I want to take a walk.

316
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,460
Even if you put yourself
in the bitterest situation all the way,

317
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,160
your boss will still not come.

318
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,930
He needs to stay at home
and looks after Xiaoxi.

319
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,400
Actually,

320
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,880
Miss Shen,

321
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
I've made it pretty clear to you.

322
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,740
Mr. Xia is just my superior.

323
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,100
I have a boyfriend.

324
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Hurry up. It's not allowed to park here.

325
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,190
I'll take you to the hospital.

326
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,080
Is there any particular hospital
you want to go to?

327
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,720
Don't bother.

328
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
Any hospital easy for you to get to.

329
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,330
Did your boyfriend

330
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,580
know you stayed overnight at a male boss's?

331
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,100
No, he didn't.

332
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,220
He didn't answer my call last night.

333
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,560
So you truly ran into human traffickers.

334
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,050
Of course! I can swear to God.

335
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,320
If you still don't believe,

336
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,010
just call the police to check.

337
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,320
Do you blame him?

338
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,840
Your boyfriend.

339
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,690
Why should I blame him?

340
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,670
He was supposed to rest then.

341
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
You are quite thoughtful.

342
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,090
Most girls think their boyfriends

343
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,660
should await their orders all day round,

344
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,610
not to mention such a horrible accident.

345
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,780
In fact, he is my first boyfriend.

346
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,750
I don't know what requests I should make

347
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,490
or what responsibilities I should take.

348
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,460
I just think

349
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,190
if I can handle it myself,

350
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,190
it's better not to bother him.

351
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,530
Moreover,

352
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,880
he was at his parents' yesterday.

353
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,920
His parents like you very much, right?

354
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,690
Yeah.

355
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,860
Look. His mother gave this to me yesterday.

356
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,310
Family heirloom?

357
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,600
I mean

358
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,380
our relationship is stable.

359
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,640
His parents also like me.

360
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,650
So nothing will happen

361
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,620
between Mr. Xia and me. That's for sure.

362
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,280
I win!

363
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,240
Okay, have a rest now.

364
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,680
Xia Ke, why did Miss Xing

365
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,030
stay overnight at your home yesterday?

366
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,000
Nothing.

367
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,620
Hum.

368
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,990
Mr. Chu always shares secrets with me.

369
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,780
I prefer Mr. Chu.

370
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,980
Did you meet him?

371
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,160
Yes. He took me to eat pizza.

372
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,260
When?

373
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
The day before yesterday.

374
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Why don't you come to my home these days?

375
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,350
Do you want me to come?

376
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,850
Yes.

377
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,100
To tell you a secret,

378
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,570
we may move house.

379
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,210
Move house?

380
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,480
Yes.

381
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,510
We'll move to Nina's.

382
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,850
She has a big house

383
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,560
and a lot of toys.

384
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
Why will you move to Nina's?

385
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,010
Nina told me her dad loved my mom

386
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,550
and wanted to marry her.

387
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,020
Mr. Chu promised to

388
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,370
give me a pizza treat every Thursday.

389
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,120
Don't tell my mom.

390
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,710
Xia Ke, Mr. Chu

391
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,180
seemed to be a bit unhappy.

392
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
Does he dislike Nina?

393
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,200
I suppose it is her father

394
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,350
that he dislikes.

395
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
Actually, I don't like him neither.

396
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,140
Don't worry, Miss Shen.

397
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,530
Your friend's injury is not a big problem.

398
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,910
Soft tissues of her ankle are injured.

399
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,810
Apply medicine for external use
to reduce pain and swelling.

400
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,730
Decrease activity and have a good rest for a few days.

401
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,210
How long does it take to recover?

402
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,360
In your case,

403
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,640
it'll take about three days to recover.

404
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,380
After one to two weeks,
you can try to move your ankle.

405
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,310
Could you write a sick note
of one week for her?

406
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,590
No, no.

407
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,620
I'm in a special time.
I can't ask for leave.

408
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,320
You won't recover soon
if you don't take a good rest.

409
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,550
I promised Mr. Xia

410
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,210
I wouldn't ask for leave
because of any reason within 3 months,

411
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,830
so he appointed me to do this project planning.

412
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,520
Up to you. But if you become lame,

413
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
I suppose Chu Nan's mother

414
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,380
will no longer accept you.

415
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,400
How did you know his name was Chu Nan?

416
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,550
Xia Ke told me.

417
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,830
Mr. Xia indeed says

418
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,160
all he knows to you.

419
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,720
Thank you for today, Shen Qing.

420
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,400
Actually Mr. Xia and you are of the same nature.

421
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,110
Cold hands, warm heart.

422
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,820
Don't take all things you see as facts.

423
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,100
Have I cleared up this misunderstanding or not?

424
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,220
Has he fallen asleep?

425
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,490
Can you make pizza?

426
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,870
Yes.

427
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,860
If you can, make it more times for him.

428
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,310
Why? It's unhealthy.

429
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,340
Because of Chu Nan?

430
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,500
I should mind you

431
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,270
whatever goes on between you two,

432
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,550
you must take good care of Shen Xiaoxi.

433
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,830
Don't worry.

434
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,290
I won't let him contact Xiaoxi anymore.

435
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,360
Can you let it go?

436
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,600
Help me take Xiaoxi to the car first.

437
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,020
Attention please!

438
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,000
Everybody,

439
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
it's time to vote the place
of our company outing

440
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,240
the week after the next week.

441
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,410
There are two choices.

442
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,550
One is romantic and cozy five-star holiday village

443
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,900
with premium dinner and CS in real life.

444
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,720
Another one is forest cabin
with whitewater rafting.

445
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,990
Vote as soon as possible.

446
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,750
I don't want to live in a forest cabin.

447
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,120
Bungee doesn't fit me.

448
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,470
Will Mr. Xia bring

449
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,920
his secret girlfriend Shen Qing

450
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,430
to the company outing this time?

451
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,980
Anyway, I will choose the deluxe
five-star holiday village.

452
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,980
(Yiyi)
Hurry up and tell me,

453
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,690
how was it going on that night?

454
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,720
You even got your ankle injured like this.

455
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,980
As to my injury, it's a long story.

456
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,700
Mr. Xia didn't interfere with your date.

457
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,310
It's beyond my expectation.

458
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,490
Your appearance is my cup of tea

459
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,560
but I will never like you.

460
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,550
In other words,

461
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,630
you capitalists are the people I hate most.

462
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,330
How can I still come to work
as if nothing happened!

463
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,410
Do you remember the beauty we met
at the underwear store?

464
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,410
She is indeed Mr. Xia's girlfriend.

465
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,070
What's more,

466
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,460
they have an illegitimate child

467
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,850
who usually stays at his girlfriend's.

468
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,900
Why don't they get married?

469
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,240
How can he announce he is single!

470
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,940
I didn't expect Mr. Xia was such a person.

471
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,820
A well-dressed man of beastly nature.

472
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,460
What happened? What's going on?

473
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,300
I also didn't expect I was such a person.

474
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,060
Come in.

475
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,280
Mr. Xia.

476
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,420
What's up?

477
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,210
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tell  everyone.

478
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,360
I typed in the wrong chat window.

479
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,640
I know I shouldn't type those words anywhere.

480
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,280
My brain must be damaged.

481
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,550
How dare I talk about my boss's gossip?

482
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,870
I'll get another cup for you.

483
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,030
So...sorry, Mr. Xia.

484
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,330
I think you'd better go home now.

485
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,160
No. I will not go back home.

486
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,130
I know I made a big mistake this time.

487
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,960
But I've worked with you for such a long time.

488
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,730
At least for my hard work's sake.

489
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,650
Moreover, it's not all my fault.

490
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,170
I didn't know your family's situation.

491
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,340
It's not what you think.

492
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,870
Actually, Shen Qing is...

493
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,290
Do... don't say it any more.

494
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,940
I don't want to know your gossip any more.

495
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,400
The more I know, the faster I'll be resigned.

496
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,970
Mr. Xia, I have to mind you

497
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,960
it's time to go for the negotiation of authorization.

498
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,290
Mr. Xia, your laptop.

499
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,370
And pens.

500
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,270
Mr. Xia.

501
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,620
Mr. Xia,

502
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,640
Mr. Xia.

503
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,160
From the underground garage to the parking space.
I still have time.

504
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,560
(Mascot)

505
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,530
Mr. Xia?

506
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,400
Where is Xing Yun?

507
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,230
I just saw her taking your laptop and going out.

508
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,720
Isn't she with you?

509
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,730
Mr. Xia!

510
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,730
Thank goodness, I caught you up.

511
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,380
What are you doing?

512
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,090
You forgot to bring your laptop

513
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,710
and your bottle.

514
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,370
Aren't you heading to the meeting of...

515
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,570
Do you know where I am going?

516
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,520
To have a meeting.

517
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,000
Aren't you going to negotiate the authorization?

518
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,440
Who tells you I can't negotiate the authorization

519
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,040
at the tennis court?

520
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,940
Want to go with me to liven things up?

521
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,060
Get on the car.

522
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,440
I'd better not.

523
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,830
I'm afraid I'll hold you back.

524
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,680
Then go back home with your

525
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,140
injured pig hoof.

526
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,200
Mr. Xia.

527
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,500
The project planning needs to be done as scheduled.

528
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,310
You must report it to me

529
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,620
by video call every day after work.

530
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,450
You... you are not going to dismiss me?

531
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,120
When can you be clever!

532
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,910
By the way,

533
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,870
take a photo of

534
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,290
your injured ankle every day.

535
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,460
Don't want to cheat me of more days off.

536
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,960
I promise. I'll be back once it is recovered.

537
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,740
Have a safe journey!

538
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,990
Wish you succeed at the very start!

539
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,560
See you, Mr. Xia!

540
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,320
Bye bye!

541
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,380
Thank goodness. Dodged a bullet again!

542
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,520
Xing Yun!

543
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,950
Why are you here?

544
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,330
Mr. Xia called you just now and I answered.

545
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,630
He told me to pack your things up

546
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,860
and go down to give them to you.

547
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,280
Why are you smiling?

548
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,650
How's it going? You are dismissed?

549
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,520
No. He told me to work at home these days.

550
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,160
He is so thoughtful.

551
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:09,970
By the way,

552
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,780
we've decided the place for our company outing.

553
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,120
It's the holiday village you like.

554
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,900
Get your ankle recovered as soon as possible.

555
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,950
And bring Chu Nan as well.

556
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,540
Bring him?

557
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,840
We'll stay overnight at the village.
It's inappropriate.

558
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,880
How old is your soul

559
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
in this young body?

560
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,940
You are adults. If you both agree,

561
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,440
just let things happen

562
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,010
as they should be.

563
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,930
Furthermore, you've already slept
at Chu Nan's home.

564
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,480
If I truly slept there,

565
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,890
how can I know secrets of our boss?

566
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,750
So you didn't stay at Chu Nan's home that night.

567
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,190
You...you stayed at our boss's?

568
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,310
Don't look at me.

569
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,080
I just promised

570
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,370
I wouldn't say any gossip of our boss.

571
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,640
No way. Hurry up and tell us.

572
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,920
Why did you go to our boss's home?

573
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,550
Where was Chu Nan? Why wasn't he with you?

574
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,230
Our boss ruined your date,

575
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,760
right?

576
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,910
Remember, he has a girlfriend

577
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,960
and an illegitimate child.

578
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,600
Where is my crutch?

579
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,560
Yun, tell me the truth.

580
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,710
Where did you stay last night?

581
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,790
Don't let your imagination run wild.

582
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,400
Chu Nan lives with his parents.

583
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,720
So you stayed with

584
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,320
his parents last night?

585
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,550
Sort of.

586
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,270
It brought too much trouble to them.

587
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,650
It is because of my dad and you.

588
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,090
You went out without telling me.

589
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,850
My daughter, are you Pigsy?

590
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,370
You are making a false countercharge.

591
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,850
It's you who lost the keys.

592
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,790
How can you blame your dad and me!

593
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,240
I've never seen anyone like you.

594
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,900
Then tell me, what made your ankle
injured like this?

595
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
It was just sprained.

596
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,530
Mom, I remember

597
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,640
I need to do overtime work.

598
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,670
I know.

599
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,070
I just want to tell you

600
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,290
your dad will leave home
earlier tomorrow morning

601
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,360
to attend a meeting at the suburb.

602
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,540
You need to get to work by taxi.

603
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
No need. I won't go to the company tomorrow.

604
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,620
My daughter, you finally realized it.

605
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,700
I've already told you

606
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,840
the world will still rotate without you.

607
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,500
Look at your ankle.

608
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,870
I've told you to take two weeks off at home.

609
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,710
Your company won't close down

610
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,040
because of your break.

611
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,360
It's not a break.

612
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,270
The workplace is changed to my home.

613
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,470
My boss allowed me to

614
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,280
work at home from tomorrow.

615
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,340
Your boss is pretty thoughtful on this.

616
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,270
It's because he feels guilty.

617
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,550
What were you saying?

618
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,810
Nothing.

619
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,600
Mom, I'm going to do overtime work.

620
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,240
You're about to rest now.

621
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,930
As you wish.

622
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,830
Finished this bowl of soup.

623
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,730
You needn't wash the bowl.

624
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,050
Okay.

625
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,280
I'll take it out tomorrow morning.

626
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,020
Big pig hoot.

627
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,450
Mr. Xia,

628
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,290
I've sent the latest project progress
to your email box.

629
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,300
Please check it out.

630
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,560
You use the wrong font size.

631
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,140
Sorry.

632
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,400
Having a 3-hour video conferencing at weekend,

633
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,640
I'm good enough to still keep breathing.

634
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,600
Continue to correct it.

635
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,040
Mr. Xia, you must have other things to deal with.

636
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,090
How about dealing with them first?

637
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,710
I'll contact you after correcting all mistakes.

638
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,330
No way. Correct them while holding the video call.

639
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,030
You'll directly go to sleep

640
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,150
after hanging up the call.

641
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,190
Mr. Xia, it's time for dinner.

642
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,530
Aren't you hungry?

643
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,410
I'm stuffed by you.

644
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,510
I'll tell my parents

645
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,690
to have dinner first.

646
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,550
Chu Nan.

647
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,280
Come in. Come in.

648
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,700
Yun, Chu Nan is here.

649
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,020
Why are you still standing there?

650
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,040
Hurry up.

651
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,590
Quickly. Put on your clothes.

652
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,780
Why is he here?

653
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,620
I called him to come.

654
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,160
You bothered him a few days ago

655
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,850
for staying at his home overnight.

656
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,250
We're supposed to invite him to our home.

657
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,760
We should ask him to dinner
just like how he treated you.

658
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,360
Why didn't you tell me?

659
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,560
I've told you.

660
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,960
When?

661
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,360
This afternoon.

662
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,450
I knocked at your door this afternoon

663
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,760
and asked "How about inviting Chu Nan for dinner?".

664
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,470
You said it was okay.

665
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,280
Now you...

666
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,120
I didn't talk to you.

667
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,520
I was having a video conference with my boss.

668
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,890
You closed your door.

669
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,640
How could I know you were
having a video conference?

670
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,760
It's so...

671
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,990
Fine. Fine.

672
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,080
Now he is here.

673
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,610
It's just a common meal.

674
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,500
Hurry up. Put on your clothes and get out.

675
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,840
Don't make him wait for a long time.

676
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,500
Quick!

677
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,970
She'll come out in a moment.

678
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,080
You don't need to.

679
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,790
We just invite you for dinner.
You don't need to bring presents.

680
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,290
No, no. I don't know what to bring

681
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,970
so I bought Mr. Xing and you some nourishment.

682
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,970
It's very kind of you.

683
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,360
Xing!

684
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,510
Come here. Let me introduce him to you.

685
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,140
This is Chu Nan.

686
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,370
This is Yun's dad.

687
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Xing. I'm Chu Nan.

688
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,580
What are you doing?

689
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,990
Chu Nan, come here and have a seat.

690
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,010
Have a seat.

691
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,010
Hi, Chu Nan.

692
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,850
Is your ankle okay?

693
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,560
No big problem.

694
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,930
That will be great.

695
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,450
It's a serious injury!
How can it be "no big problem"?

696
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,380
Do you think it's not a big problem

697
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,870
until my daughter's ankle is broken?

698
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,140
Dad, you misunderstood.

699
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,840
My injury has truly nothing to do with Chu Nan.

700
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,260
Nothing to do with him?

701
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,750
He took you to his home that night.

702
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,120
Your ankle was good before you left home.

703
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,860
But when you came back,
it had been sprained.

704
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,200
If it's not his business, then whose?

705
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,840
Enough.

706
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,260
We invited Chu Nan for dinner.

707
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,910
Why were you talking about this?

708
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,680
Come here. Have a seat.

709
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,550
Have a seat.

710
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,530
Chu Nan, actually

711
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,760
it's Yun who should be blamed.

712
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,820
After she came back that day,

713
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,610
we asked her what had happened.

714
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,880
But she said nothing

715
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,440
and directly went into her room
to do overtime work.

716
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,790
She is so...

717
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,090
In fact, that night...

718
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,870
I indeed didn't take good care of Xing Yun that night.

719
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm truly sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Xing.

720
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,490
It's all my fault.

721
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,880
I asked her to go out and have fun.

722
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,380
So what did you do

723
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,560
that made her injured like this?

724
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:46,440
Rock-climbing.

725
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,720
You?

726
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,340
What a good news!

727
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,200
My daughter can do rock-climbing!

728
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,020
She stays at home after school
or work all these years.

729
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,270
Her motor nerves

730
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,460
have already degraded into nuclei.

731
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,700
But... you took her to do rock-climbing?

732
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,910
It's a good thing.

733
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,200
But remember to be careful

734
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,770
when you exercise outdoors next time.
Safety comes first.

735
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,700
I know, Mrs. Xing.

736
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,880
Mr. Xing, I was negligent this time.

737
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,820
I understand your feelings.

738
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,180
I'll definitely pay much more attention next time

739
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,160
to ensure Xing Yun's safety.

740
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,880
That's right.

741
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,560
Your daughter stays at home

742
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,880
to do overwork or watch anime after work.

743
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,430
She doesn't exercise at all.

744
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,660
How can she keep healthy?

745
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,310
Now there is a person

746
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,280
persuading her to exercise outdoors

747
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,310
and enjoy life. It's a good thing.

748
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,970
But you should do it step by step.

749
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,320
Yes, you are right. I was too hasty.

750
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,400
Remember,

751
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,290
if you are going to do dangerous exercise
like this in the future,

752
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,630
be sure to tell your parents in advance.

753
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,060
Am I right?

754
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,410
Yes, of course.

755
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,050
Did you listen to me?

756
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,160
Yes, I heard that.

757
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,280
Well, enough education.

758
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Are you going to make us eat cold food?

759
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,520
I'll get the rice for you.

760
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,390
Let's start.

761
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,040
-You are so... -Thank you, Mrs. Xing.

762
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,720
You're welcome. Help yourself.

763
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,220
Did you draw this?

764
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,100
It's my first time to see your drawing.

765
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,770
You are awesome.

766
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,720
Don't you have anything want to ask?

767
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,090
You mean the thing mentioned just now?

768
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:50,160
I think you don't want to cause troubles

769
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,680
so you didn't tell much to your parents.

770
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,360
Actually I called you that day

771
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,840
and sent messages to you.

772
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,800
I've received them.

773
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,560
You said you ran into an accident.

774
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,240
Is that this?

775
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,200
Yes. In fact, on my way to

776
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,840
see my boss that day,

777
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,430
I ran into human trafficking.

778
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,520
Human trafficking?

779
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,460
I was fine.

780
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,680
But my bag was robbed by human traffickers.

781
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,320
My identification, keys and money
were all in that bag.

782
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,690
I also lost my laptop.

783
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,160
I see.

784
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,470
Sorry. I should have driven you there.

785
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,000
No, no. It's not your fault.

786
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,400
I was too careless.

787
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,730
But don't you want to know

788
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,130
where I slept that night?
