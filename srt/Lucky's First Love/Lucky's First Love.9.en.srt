=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,660
=Episode 9=

3
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,820
Hey, Mr. Xia!

4
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,940
You prepared well.

5
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,900
As long as you're happy.

6
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,900
Also, I already sent you an email
with the travel plans

7
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,420
for Shanghai and the surrounding area.

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,020
I don't remember

9
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,260
I've transferred you a second salary.

10
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,020
We're so close, there's really no reason
to discuss money.

11
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,740
Just buy me a Garage Kit while you're there.

12
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,180
Garage Kit?

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,260
I've already sent you the address
of the second hand shop

14
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,020
and a picture of the Garage Kit.

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,140
I'll pay for it myself. Thanks, Mr. Xia.

16
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,340
（No.5 Daru Lane, Shangcheng district,
Hangzhou)

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,180
I mean if it's on the way.

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,460
If you happen to pass the shop.

19
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,780
I'm curious

20
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,620
as to how you can call Hangzhou "on the way"?

21
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,540
Two hours there and back,

22
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,460
and you can visit the paradise on earth
while you're there.

23
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,180
I'm just trying to make sure

24
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,700
that you get to enjoy a proper relaxing break.

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,100
How did you discover this place?

26
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,360
I've known about it for ages.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,240
But, no matter how beautiful somewhere is,

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
if we weren't here together to enjoy it,

29
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,340
it would be a real pity.

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,820
Let's take a look over there.

31
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,980
OK. Let's go.

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,340
Mr. Xia, are you still there?

33
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,100
What's the earliest flight
to Hangzhou tomorrow morning?

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,700
You're taking the plane?

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,260
It's so close, I don't think
they even have flights.

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,340
It's for you to buy your own Garage Kit!

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,380
Do you think I'm a courier service?

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,380
I knew he wouldn't agree.

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,360
Darling, Mom can’t take you home.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,120
Xia Ke, what were you thinking just then?

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,300
You want her to come?

42
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,500
There are millions of different lives

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,300
hidden behind the endless stream of lights.

44
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,300
Mr. Xia, are you happy with your current life?

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,900
No.

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,180
Who supports Dongdong?

47
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,660
I do!

48
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,020
Me.

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,260
What are you doing?

50
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,060
Xing Yun, are you in?

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,780
What is Hero Board?

52
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,860
Hero Board is a traditional project of TIG's.

53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,700
So that everyone keeps their enthusiasm for games,

54
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,580
there are different themed games every month

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
as new challenges.

56
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,500
Whoever gets the best results,

57
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,300
will win a reward of 2,000 yuan.

58
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,540
A reward?!

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,420
Game companies get such good benefits!

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,140
Mr. He, let me explain it to you.

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,980
The list up top is of the participants in the game.

62
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,500
These magnets down below aren't participating,

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,340
but they support one of their colleague's camps.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,580
We each bet afternoon tea and snacks on the game.

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,660
Then what are the games usually like?

66
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,820
There are lots of different kinds.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,340
Yiyi is the master at prize claw

68
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,380
and the current record holder.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,540
In 10 minutes,

70
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,280
she can get eight prizes.

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,740
And whenever she plays,

72
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,380
she dresses herself up like a sorceress.

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,020
She never tells us what her secret is, either.

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,660
Mr. Xia is impressive too.

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,580
When it comes to racing games,

76
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,460
no matter if it's time trials,

77
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,020
high-performance sports cars,

78
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,860
or Crazyracing Kartrider,

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,260
he is the undefeatable champion.

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,580
It doesn't matter if he's up
against professional gamers,

81
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,540
or school kids,

82
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,540
he absolutely destroys them.

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,420
He's been top of our rankings for a long time,

84
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,740
and in the national top 10.

85
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,540
But Mr. Xia doesn't ever accept the reward;

86
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,780
only the praise.

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,660
And the reward goes to second place.

88
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,300
When it comes to first-person shooters,

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
then our programmer, Hu,

90
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,680
is the undisputed king.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,860
Then what are you playing this month?

92
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,140
This month, we're playing a VR game.

93
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,300
Zombie Asylum difficulty mode.

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,180
The one who can live the longest
and get through the most levels, will win.

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,340
Then let me interrupt.

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,140
This zombie game

97
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,020
is too difficult for me.

98
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,380
And you need to wear VR goggles.

99
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm not entering this month.

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,460
Not for me.

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,660
Dongdong! Giving up!

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,500
We all… We all bet on you!

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,780
He's more of a chicken than a little girl!

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,580
Mr. He, will you participate?

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,180
If I do,

106
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,580
won't that matter come out?

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,980
You're hesitating too?

108
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,660
Not all men are men of steel.

109
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
Give up. You'll just embarrass yourself.

110
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,300
Give it a try. I'll support you.

111
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,140
We haven't had any new players for ages.

112
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,260
I'll support you too, Mr. He.

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,020
You'll really do it?

114
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,520
(He Yu)

115
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,580
I'll be putting my support behind Mr. He.

116
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,220
I am too.

117
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,940
Anyone else offering their support?

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Then I'll support Maggie.

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,060
She loves watching horror movies.

120
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,340
Then I'll support Hu.

121
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,380
Why are you staring at me?

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,800
I mean,

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,620
after the power cut,

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,100
you still said you'd support me in your Hero game?

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,960
What are you up to?

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,700
It was in front of everyone.

127
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,180
It would have been embarrassing
if you'd said no.

128
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,360
I was trying to help.

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,980
Don't worry.

130
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,700
At the time, just make up some excuse

131
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,860
about not having finished your work

132
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,640
and that you can't make it.

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,580
No, you…you haven't told anyone?

134
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm not that boring.

135
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,260
And it's not like it was anything to boast about.

136
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Why would I tell anyone?

137
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
Come on. Another one.

138
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,440
This won't do, my face looks fat.

139
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,400
It's not a good angle. You take it.

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,160
Those girls are hot.

141
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,020
Can you pull them?

142
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,560
So annoying.

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,620
Watch me.

144
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,140
OK.

145
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,020
Finger heart.

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,220
Hey, watch where you're putting your hands.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,740
I don't want a drink.

148
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,460
Take your hands off her. Get off her.

149
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,660
Hey, get your hands off her.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,180
Get off.

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,860
Didn't you hear her say
she didn't want to drink?

152
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,080
What's it to do with you?

153
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,980
Why not come and have a drink with me?

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
Drink?

155
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Let's go.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Hey, get her!

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,260
Xia Ke?

158
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,140
Yao Qing, long time no see.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,220
Who'd have thought? After all this time,

160
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,460
when we do meet,
it's in such an explosive situation.

161
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,340
When did you learn to fight?

162
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,100
I heard from He Yu

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,220
that you've taken on Jiawo's TIG project?

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
Back when we were studying overseas,

165
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,900
the three of us were known as the deadly assassins.

166
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,460
Then we went together to Jiaowo on internships.

167
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,420
And now I've been sent to the subsidiary in Shanghai

168
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,060
and He Yu is a project manager at HQ.

169
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,300
But you, you've changed careers
and become the president of a gaming company.

170
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,340
OK, this is me.

171
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,220
Do you have far to go?

172
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,340
Not really.

173
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,800
But would you mind

174
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,860
if I could get a bit cleaned up first at your place?

175
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Of course not. Let's go.

176
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,720
Xia Ke, a call.

177
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,340
It's probably the hotel's laundry service.

178
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Yes.

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,340
Is this Mr. Xia's room?

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Xia Ke? I think he's still in the shower.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,220
The shower?

182
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,140
Apologies.

183
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,220
I am Mr. Xia's secretary, Amy.

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,580
I need to speak to him about something.

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
Could you put him over to me?

186
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,620
Hold on.

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,980
Yes.

188
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,020
OK, understood.

189
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,020
We cannot delay a second over Mr. Sun.

190
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,740
Because we can't rush this.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,220
Tomorrow at nine o'clock,

192
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,820
send the conference minutes on email.

193
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,880
That's all.

194
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,900
What?

195
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,820
Nothing, I was just a bit startled
by your president-like authority.

196
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,800
It's so late and you're still working?

197
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I have no choice.

198
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,180
Then, I'll be going.

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,100
By the way,

200
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,780
just now you asked me

201
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,980
when I learned to fight.

202
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,980
In the end, I went to learn kendo too.

203
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Got pretty far.

204
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,220
Xia Ke, I…

205
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Yao Qing, it's late.

206
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,120
Go home and get an early night.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
OK. Then, goodbye.

208
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,040
Bye.

209
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,940
At 10:42,

210
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,380
in Mr. Xia's hotel room,

211
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,300
a woman and a shower.

212
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
Forgive me for not highlighting the obvious.

213
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,460
What do these key points tell us?

214
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,740
I know!

215
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,860
There's only one expression for it.

216
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,580
One night stand!

217
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,900
Why do some people seem to be so depressed?

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm here pouring tea,

219
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,060
waiting on clients,

220
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,980
while he's out there
having fun and indulging himself.

221
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,380
Why shouldn't I be depressed?

222
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,180
There's nothing you can do about that.

223
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,160
That's the difference between you and the boss.

224
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
What are you all up to?

225
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,500
It's the last day of the month.

226
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,380
It's Hu's asylum challenge.

227
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,060
Aren't you going to come and see?

228
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,220
Yes. Yes.

229
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,860
Let's go.

230
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,800
Come on. Another one.

231
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,700
Come on. Quick.

232
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,940
That was terrifying.

233
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,500
It nearly gave me a heart attack!

234
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,860
Jeez, Hu, you lasted 32 minutes.

235
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,980
You didn't break Maggie's record of 47 minutes.

236
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,540
Hu, couldn't you have hung in there?

237
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,940
You're in second place.

238
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,860
You try. You try.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,540
No.

240
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,980
Enough. There's no point going on.

241
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,860
Maggie is going to win.

242
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,540
Not so fast, Dongdong.

243
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,980
Mr. He hasn't had his go yet.

244
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,020
He's in a meeting at Jiawo.

245
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,760
He might not make it back in time.

246
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,300
Who says?

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,580
You're back!

248
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,460
You're worried about me?

249
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,300
No.

250
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,800
There are so many people watching.
Think about this.

251
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,660
Are you really going to play?

252
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,860
To repay you for your support,

253
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,980
I have decided to push myself to the limits.

254
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,300
Don't get too emotional.

255
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,900
Just think of how you're going to repay me.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,580
Come on. Mr. He.

257
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,160
Please.

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,860
Come, a round of applause for Mr. He.

259
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,220
OK!

260
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,300
Come on, Mr. He!

261
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,580
Impressive.

262
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,300
Wow!

263
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
You completed it!

264
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,260
How long?

265
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,540
Two hours.

266
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,940
Mr. He, you've been keeping
that side of you a secret.

267
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,340
Keep this record for me.

268
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,460
As to the reward,

269
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,060
you can all use it to get some drinks and snacks.

270
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,240
Iced Latte for Dongdong on Monday.

271
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,640
Milk matcha with an egg tart for Linda on Tuesday.

272
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,940
Red bean slush puppy for Wu on Wednesday.

273
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,060
There's a whole month's worth.

274
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,820
How will you repay me?

275
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,660
Someone who's been on Fuji-Q Highland

276
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,860
as if it was nothing, and you want repaying?

277
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,700
You knew

278
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,580
that I was pretending during the power cut?

279
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,500
Who told you that I'd been on Fuji-Q Highland?

280
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,580
Xia Ke?

281
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,140
I…

282
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,460
So, you deliberately

283
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,080
used me to win you your afternoon drinks and snacks,

284
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,660
by pretending

285
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,220
that you were worried about me?

286
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,060
You tricked me once; I used you once.

287
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,380
We're even now, no?

288
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,420
As if!

289
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,380
I left the Jiawo regular meeting

290
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,340
to get back on time!

291
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,100
Mr. He, don't be angry.

292
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,420
How can I not be?

293
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,580
I gave up my work

294
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,740
just so that

295
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,380
I could see you moved

296
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,420
and in tears of gratitude!

297
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,580
I'd even prepared a camera!

298
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,980
You're that childish?

299
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,860
I can be even more childish.

300
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm not in a good mood.

301
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,380
I don't feel like working,

302
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,980
so I'm afraid you'll have to wait

303
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,380
for the draft for the promotional strategy.

304
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,940
Don't. Don't.

305
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,820
I know.

306
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,180
You can have half of my drinks.

307
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,900
I don't want to be in your office
for half of the next month!

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,380
Then what do you want?

309
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,580
Find a restaurant with a good atmosphere
and treat me to dinner!

310
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,900
So that you can make a sincere apology to me.

311
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,380
You're the one that started all this.

312
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,540
What are you doing here?

313
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,180
I took the day off especially for you.

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
Come on. I'll show you around.

315
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,860
Don't say no.

316
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,900
Jiawo is having a press conference today.

317
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,260
I might have to make a video call with He Yu.

318
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,660
And?

319
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
Don't tell him that we met.

320
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,520
I can't stand the way he gossips.

321
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,260
OK.

322
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,060
No way. Don't overreact like this.

323
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,940
If you're going to go looking through his stuff,
at least close the door.

324
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
And pull the curtains, jeez!

325
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Hello, Mr. He.

326
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,420
I've found your USB.

327
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,140
Great.

328
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,020
You're really my lucky charm.

329
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,260
Then help me

330
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,620
take it to the banquet hall on the third floor
of the Qianxi Hotel.

331
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,700
Mr. He, I don't think your event this afternoon

332
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
has anything to do with our company.

333
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
I will deliver it for you.

334
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,220
And, don't call me Lucky.

335
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,900
The information on there is top-secret

336
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,760
and I wouldn't trust anyone else with it.

337
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,940
Then you shouldn't leave something so important
just lying around…

338
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,180
Hey!

339
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,260
Mr. He?

340
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,700
This is the number for that popular restaurant you wanted.

341
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,280
Do you want to book a table?

342
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,100
Of course.

343
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm going to finish this tonight

344
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,580
once and for all.

345
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,120
Afternoon.

346
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,540
I want these all in order.

347
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,860
They must be evenly spaced.

348
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,980
Make sure you don't damage that.

349
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,420
Put it over there.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,100
Put the sign to the right of the entrance.

351
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Yes.

352
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,740
Arrange the flowers on that table.

353
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,620
Go and check on the gifts
we've got for the media.

354
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,440
Yes, Mr. He.

355
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,900
Miss Yao, do you have any instructions?

356
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,100
Alice, I need to talk to you.

357
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,860
When the guests come in,

358
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,260
security will be in place, right?

359
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,460
OK. Got it.

360
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,780
OK. Then in a bit…

361
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,060
It's the final press conference today.

362
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,860
Can you withhold your cynical nature
for the time being

363
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,040
and let me see how the venue is?

364
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,580
You really need to change

365
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,140
your suspicious and paranoid temper.

366
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,060
Otherwise, Xia Ke will never like you.

367
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,940
Shut it.

368
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,660
Xia Ke? You two are together?

369
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,260
Mr. He.

370
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,100
Are you abusing the company's resources?

371
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,900
Of course not. We've always shared things.

372
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,620
I'm really busy. I'd better be going.

373
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,540
I won't interrupt your date any longer.

374
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,900
Bye.

375
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,260
OK. Don't worry about him.

376
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,020
Where else do you want to go?

377
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,860
If we go to Hangzhou for the day,

378
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,580
is there enough time?

379
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,740
You mean right now?

380
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,900
What do you think of the venue?

381
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,780
Here's your USB.
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

382
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,860
You're here already. Take a look round first.

383
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,420
This product is perfect for you.

384
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,860
What product?

385
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,340
An anti-wrinkling series.

386
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,020
You're always frowning whenever you see me.

387
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,020
So you could really use this product.

388
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,060
Goodbye.

389
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,180
Have you booked the restaurant for tonight?

390
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,780
Seven o'clock.

391
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,580
I'll text you the address.

392
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,980
Can I go now, Mr. He?

393
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
He Yu, a guest is arguing with the models.

394
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,420
Why?

395
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,260
It's too much of a squeeze in the dressing room

396
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,420
and they can't get ready,

397
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,660
so two models

398
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,820
went into the guest's dressing room.

399
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,540
Wherever there are women, there's always trouble.

400
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,060
I'll be going.

401
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,940
See you tonight.

402
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,000
Another new girlfriend?

403
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,120
Don't ask.

404
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,260
This is the video file.

405
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,380
Remember to play the one without the date.

406
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,180
I'm leaving this to you.

407
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,420
OK. That's all for now.

408
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,220
And then, let me see…

409
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,780
Excuse me, I have something to attend to.

410
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,380
I…

411
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,180
He, I've missed you so much.

412
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,860
Alice, what are you doing here?

413
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,460
I work in this hotel.

414
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,180
Had you forgotten?

415
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,340
Great.

416
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,100
Then you can find a dressing room for me.

417
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
You haven't contacted me for ages.

418
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,380
Have you lost your memory?

419
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,220
Three months ago,

420
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,580
we agreed that we'd go our separate ways.

421
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,980
I don't agree. I want to be with you.

422
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm really busy. I'll contact you another day.

423
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,500
Come here!

424
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,700
I don't believe you.

425
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,300
I'll help you find a dressing room.

426
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,380
You just stay put in here.

427
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
You're not going anywhere.

428
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,620
Alice!

429
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,180
Quit messing around. I'm really busy!

430
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,300
I…

431
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,120
Open the door!

432
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
(Lucky: 7PM at 805 Mingyang Lane,
Lanxi district, Fangcheng City)

433
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,920
So, you were going to go and see Lucky.

434
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,340
Let me tell you.

435
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,620
She isn't lucky meeting me today!

436
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,060
Alice!

437
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
Don't, don't be like this, OK?!

438
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,740
Al-Alice!

439
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,060
Alice!

440
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,760
Help yourselves.

441
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,380
Kids,

442
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,580
are Ms. Shen Qing's cakes good?

443
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,380
Yes!

444
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,980
Dean, don't worry.

445
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,220
These cakes

446
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,940
are all made with imported cream.

447
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,520
They're very healthy.

448
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
After all these years,

449
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,400
seeing you two together again,

450
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,180
makes me really happy.

451
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,220
Dean, don't misunderstand.

452
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,820
Actually,

453
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,900
Mr. Ling ordered the cakes for the kids.

454
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,500
I just helped deliver them.

455
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
Dean, get back to what you were doing.

456
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,580
We'll go for a walk around.

457
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,240
Thank you for agreeing to come back
to the welfare home with me.

458
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
You're my client.

459
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,620
You placed so many orders,

460
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,180
it's my duty to deliver them.

461
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,280
After all these years, it really hasn't changed.

462
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,640
Sit.

463
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,420
Look at them.

464
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,260
Does it remind you of us back then?

465
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,580
Higher. Higher.

466
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,720
I can't, I'm afraid you'll fall off.

467
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm not afraid if you're protecting me.

468
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,700
Sorry, the phone you have dialed

469
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,300
is not responding, please call again later.

470
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,220
It's about to start.

471
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,200
Where has He Yu gotten to?

472
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
You still can't contact him?

473
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,480
We can't wait any longer.

474
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,240
Just choose one.

475
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,900
Both these videos are called "opening show".

476
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,140
One has a date and the other one doesn't.

477
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,340
Which one did He Yu say to use?

478
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,020
This one.

479
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,380
Who cares, just hurry up and play it.

480
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,220
You have such good luck.

481
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,580
Originally, someone else had ordered this one,

482
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,100
but then they changed their minds.

483
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,320
But it's not cheap.

484
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
I don't care.

485
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,500
Who are you buying this for?

486
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Is there someone you like?

487
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,940
I'm just buying it on someone else's behalf.

488
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
When did you become so kind?

489
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,840
Hold this.

490
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,240
(Yun)
(*As Yun in Xing Yun. Also means lucky)

491
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,840
I want to buy this.

492
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,800
He, bad news.

493
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,540
I think something went wrong
at the press conference.

494
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,820
What happened?

495
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,620
I don't know.

496
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,800
But your clients don't look very happy.

497
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,060
I just wanted to mess you about.

498
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,400
What's going on?

500
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,140
Weren't we supposed to be broadcasting live?

501
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,900
After our broadcast had gotten halfway through,

502
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,260
our clients received a message from their lawyers

503
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,580
saying that some of the photos

504
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,060
were taken by Liu Shunyu.

505
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,740
We didn't have the copyright, so…

506
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,500
Although we managed to finish the conference,

507
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
the clients said

508
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,540
that they were going to follow up on this.

509
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,260
Didn't I tell you to use the one without a date?

510
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,140
I'd already changed the photos in that new version.

511
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,340
I forgot.

512
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,820
Are you Mr. He?

513
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,120
Alice asked me to give this to you.

514
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,520
(Missed calls)

515
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,220
(Mr. Qian)

516
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,860
He Yu, I don't care where you are,

517
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,140
I want you back here right now!

518
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,360
OK, I've got to go back.
We'll talk about this later.

519
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

520
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,940
Half a year!

521
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,780
We've worked on this project for half a year

522
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,460
and now you've completely messed up the press conference!

523
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,540
Liu Shunyu wants to sue us for copyright infringement.

524
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,500
And he wants to sue our clients!

525
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,940
What are you going to do?

526
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,160
Did you play that video?

527
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,380
Do you want to lose your job?!

528
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,320
I…

529
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,720
I told him to play it.

530
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,140
Then both of you can get out of here!

531
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,820
I'm responsible for this.

532
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't give them a hard time.

533
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,780
Of course you are.

534
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,660
You are responsible for this project.

535
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,500
Where did you go?

536
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,260
I want this explained.

537
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,660
I…had some personal matters.

538
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,540
What kind of attitude is that?

539
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,520
Personal matters?!

540
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,140
What personal matters do you have
that I don't know about?

541
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,320
You just wait.

542
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,960
You're suspended.

543
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,920
What are you looking at?!

544
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,160
Get out of here!

545
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,760
Yes.

546
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,460
Hello.

547
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,240
Something's come up.

549
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,860
Mr. He, you better not be lying to me

550
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,740
and doing this on purpose.

551
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,140
You're not still waiting for me, are you?

552
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,020
What do you think?

553
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,700
Are you an idiot? You've been waiting
all this time on your own?

554
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,660
Hey, this is a buffet dinner.

555
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,740
There's a time limit.

556
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,660
Then there's no need to stand here like a fool.

557
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,580
Look at the time.

558
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,220
Mr. He, have a look around.

559
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,260
Where else is there?

560
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,380
What if you'd come looking for me?

561
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,660
I'd already promised Mr. Xia

562
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,700
that I'd wait on you, old man.

563
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,300
I'm freezing.

564
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,540
You're so cute.

565
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,780
Get off me.

566
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,500
Now look, the restaurant closed five minutes ago.

567
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm going home. Goodbye.

568
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
Don't.

569
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,860
I'll take you

570
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,920
to a 24 hour cafe.

571
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,060
I'll get you something to eat.

572
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,620
My treat.

573
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,940
And, I have something really important to ask you.

574
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,300
Although I didn't get to treat you to dinner,

575
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,940
I waited so long,

576
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,640
which shows that I was sincere.

577
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,540
I hope you can hand in the report on time tomorrow.

578
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,020
Our debts to each other should be completely cancelled.

579
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,360
Anything else?

580
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,040
Yes.

581
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,300
Be my girlfriend.

582
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,040
What did you say?

583
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,660
Be my girlfriend.

584
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
Are you mad?

585
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,000
Got it. I'll get a return ticket as soon as I can.

586
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
How is He Yu?

587
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,600
OK. Goodbye.

588
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,060
I'm afraid I'll have to go back to Fangcheng City
earlier than expected.

589
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,460
Your, your friend

590
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
really didn't let me down.

591
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,380
He's given me a pretty old heap of problems.

592
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,360
What happened?

593
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,500
Something went wrong.

594
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,100
The client was a Shanghai

595
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,900
cosmetics company, pretty famous.

596
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Now they're being sued.

597
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,940
He Yu is probably going to be suspended as well.

598
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,840
There's a good chance it will influence your project.

599
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,700
Then when are you planning on going back?

600
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,440
Tomorrow morning.

601
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,920
I'll come with you.

602
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,320
Shen Qing.

603
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,240
I'll take you up.

604
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,320
No need.

605
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,660
Shen Qing,

606
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,660
back then I really thought I would be crippled.

607
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,920
I didn't want to hold you back.

608
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,680
And I didn't want to see you have to face a cripple.

609
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,020
After all these years,

610
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,120
I still can't forget you.

611
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,000
Shen Qing,

612
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,920
let's start over, OK?

613
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,740
Ling Shan, calm down.

614
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,380
I've already kept my calm for too long.

615
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,040
I don't want to keep calm anymore.

616
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,660
I want to go back to how things were.

617
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,660
Back to when things weren't calm between us.

618
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,120
Shen Qing, I love you.

619
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,500
I still love you, honestly.

620
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:29,820
Shen Qing.

621
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,280
Ling Shan, Ling Shan!

622
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,140
Ling Shan, don't be like this.

623
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,480
Shen Qing, don't reject me just like that.

624
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,920
Think about it.

625
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,580
I want to give you and Xiaoxi a proper family.

626
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
Is there someone you like?

627
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
(Xing Yun)

628
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,300
Xing Yun, that's a lucky name.

629
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,280
You're the one.

630
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,220
I have

631
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,220
a mobile games company

632
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,200
that is still in the start-up period.

633
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,500
I don't know if you're interested?

634
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,380
What kind of company?

635
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,500
What kind of games?

636
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,460
The kind that gives people a place
to let out a sigh of relief

637
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,740
when they are in their moment of despair.

638
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,540
Fine.

639
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,180
Aren't you going to ask about the pay?

640
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,620
Bosses who want to produce games like that

641
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,420
won't let their staff down.

642
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,460
I believe in you.

643
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,280
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

644
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,780
I won't forget this.

645
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
I'll make it up to you for the rest of my life.

646
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,940
Where's my Garage Kit?

647
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,760
Are you afraid you'll fall for me?

648
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,800
I…

649
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,700
Mr. Xia, you're back.

650
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,460
You must be tired.

651
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,660
Xing Yun came,

652
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,620
but your flight came in too late,

653
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,240
and she had a meeting to attend,
so she called me here.

654
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,100
Then let's go, Amy.

655
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,900
Straight back to the company.

656
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Sorry.

657
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,780
Sorry.

658
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,780
Mr. Xia, what are you doing here?

659
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,060
You wanted to sell the company's secrets
while I wasn't here?

660
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,380
No, the paper shredder is broken,

661
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,340
so I was taking them to a printer
to have them destroyed.

662
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,140
Where's Amy?

663
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,140
Why didn't you go home?

664
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,900
What's going on, Xing Yun?

665
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,820
The shredder is broken.

666
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
OK. OK.

667
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,320
Go with Mr. Xia.

668
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,300
No need, I'll take…

669
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,420
He's in a really bad mood.

670
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,220
I didn't even want to share an elevator with him.

671
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,660
Go.

672
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,100
And me…?

673
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,640
Who will give me a hand?

674
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,740
So, Mr. Xia…

675
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,500
It must have been a tiring trip.

676
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,820
What are you trying to say?

677
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,100
The climate there is good, right?

678
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,560
Did you get the time to go and see the sights?

679
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,340
I mean…

680
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,860
I was wondering if my guide was any good.

681
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Could it have been better?

682
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,900
I'll bear it in mind in the future.

683
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,740
I got the feeling

684
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,140
that your guide was full of your own preferences.

685
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
When you put your heart into something,

686
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,660
there is always going to be
a lot of your own trace on it.

687
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,440
You must have a lot of spare time.

688
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,980
You can even send your trace to go with me?

689
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,540
In my life, I've been working like a dog.

690
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,000
I've been longing for you to get back every day.

691
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,020
Whether you've been working hard or not,
isn't something you just claim.

692
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,300
In a bit, I'll see how far

693
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,560
our cooperation with Jiawo is going.

694
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,540
Then I'll know.

695
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,260
This is ridiculous!

696
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,100
You clearly know that Mr. Xia…

697
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,740
Hello, Mr. Xia.

698
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,020
Mr….Mr. Xia.

699
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,580
Mr. Xia.

700
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,140
Who was it?

701
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,100
Who did this?

702
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,260
Who received flowers at the company?

703
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,620
Everyone knows that Mr. Xia has a pollen allergy.

704
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,760
Come forward.

705
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,740
Who?

706
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,060
Yours.

707
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
(It's my luck to meet you)
(*With Lucky and He Yu in Chinese)

708
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,440
You've done a good job while I've been away.

709
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,200
You've even been adding your own decorations.

710
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,060
No.

711
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,220
Mr. Xia, I can explain this.

712
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,540
Come to my office in five minutes.

713
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,340
If I'd known,

714
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,700
I should have sent him flying downstairs.

715
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,340
Xing Yun, what luck you've had recently?

716
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,180
An iron tree that hasn't blossomed for a millennium,

717
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,460
can receive a monster too.

718
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,980
Monster?

719
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,540
They didn't forget to add one line when sending these!

720
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,220
If I'm a monster, then he's a beast!

721
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,660
What are you talking about?

722
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,060
I mean that the brand of this flower company
is called Monster.

723
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,580
It's really popular online right now.

724
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,660
For Mr. He to send you such quality flowers,

725
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,860
it seems like such a waste.

726
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,500
As if!

727
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,860
He deliberately did this.

728
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,700
Him and Mr. Xia have been friends for so long,

729
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,180
as if he didn't know he was allergic to pollen.

730
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,820
He deliberately chose this time to send them.

731
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,300
He just wanted to get the boss
to give me a good rollicking.

732
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,980
So ruthless.

733
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,180
I take back what I said.

734
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,540
He isn't a beast, he's below a beast.

735
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,900
That's the way your logic works?

736
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,180
Who knows when your brain started thinking

737
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,140
in this crazy dead-end manner?

738
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Mr. Xia.

739
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,480
Enter.

740
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,180
I've already sent the flowers
to the front desk in the lobby.

741
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,760
Donated them in your name.

742
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,380
Are you trying to keep me from speaking?

743
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,820
You've seen through me again.

744
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,340
Come on, how is progress going?

745
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,140
I still haven't gotten the draft from Jiawo.

746
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,700
Mr. He has tried everything to put things off.

747
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,980
But one of them…

748
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,700
Which one? Relying on his charm?

749
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,100
He asked me to be his girlfriend.

750
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,300
And what did you say?

751
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,940
I ignored him, of course.

752
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,180
I stood right up.

753
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,300
Then I thought about how you said
that this cooperation was so important,

754
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,660
and that I had to agree to anything Mr. He wanted,

755
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,000
so I sat back down.

756
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,980
How can you be that stupid?

757
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,980
How can you just agree to be his girlfriend?

758
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,820
I didn't agree.

759
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,920
I said that I had to ask you first.

760
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,460
So he's courting you?

761
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,660
Fine. Mr. He got what he wanted this time.

762
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,580
The whole company is laughing at me.

763
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,980
It's no good. I'll call him.

764
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,800
Enough.

765
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,300
I know him better than you.

766
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,140
He'll keep sending you flowers.

767
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,700
He's just waiting for you to call him.

768
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,100
Then what should I do?

769
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,880
Do you know why kids

770
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,240
like to do the things grownups won't let them?

771
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,540
Reaffirm their existence.

772
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,900
If you keep calm and don't respond
for a couple of days,

773
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,140
he'll just give up.

774
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,040
Mr. Xia, you really are more experienced than me.

775
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,620
What's that?

776
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,240
There's something for you in the trunk of the car.

777
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,340
The Garage Kit?!

778
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Thank you, Mr. Xia!

779
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,500
Hello, Mengmeng.

780
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,180
In the future, any flowers for Xing Yun,

781
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,780
send them straight to my office.

782
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,220
I knew that Mr. Xia was cold on the outside
but warm deep down.

783
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,980
All my work preparing his guide really paid off.

784
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,260
Come to me, my limited edition.

785
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,940
Mr. Xia, I found this in your car boot.

786
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,800
What else did you think would be there?

787
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,460
I knew I shouldn't have relied on you.

788
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,320
You must have been so busy that you forgot.

789
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,920
This isn't what I wanted.

790
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,040
It's still just a decoration.
Why do you have to be so picky?

791
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,740
Can you even

792
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,220
mention my Garage Kits and this in the same breath?

793
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,820
Honestly.

794
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,780
Those who don't appreciate wealth,
aren't appreciated by wealth.

795
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,620
What is he talking about?

796
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,180
It even has my name on it.

797
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Then I'll accept it.

798
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,780
When it comes to the end of year bonus,

799
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,260
I hope you'll remember this

800
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
and be generous.

801
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,280
Actually, looking at it, it's pretty cute.

802
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,980
I'll call you Wang Cai (wealth).

803
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,020
Let's work together to empty the boss's wallet.
