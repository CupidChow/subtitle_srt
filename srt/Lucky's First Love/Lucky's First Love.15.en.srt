=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,580
=Episode 15=

3
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,540
What happened?

4
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,740
A game company called Huize

5
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,380
has released a new game trailer

6
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,300
in which the content of instance

7
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,420
is exactly the same as ours.

8
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,540
It can't be true.

9
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,220
Just now, Director Wang has detained

10
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,820
all of Xing Yun's things,

11
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,420
saying Xing Yun was suspected of being a leaker.

12
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,140
How could Xing Yun possibly be a leaker?

13
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,660
Is this a crime show? Detaining
and leaking secrets are really too much.

14
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,380
I found it. Do you mean this video?

15
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,180
What does that mean?

16
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,420
Does this trailer have a similar content
of our instance?

17
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,260
Yeah.

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,020
Look, we might say great minds think alike,

19
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,220
so it is excusable that they might have used
the similar idea template.

20
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,140
But if even the content is the same,

21
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,820
that could be created by the same mind.

22
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
That might not be Xing Yun.

23
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
There are a lot of people who know this instance.

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,900
How could this be?

25
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,300
Xing Yun, do you want to explain this?

26
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,860
What does this mean?

27
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,660
Listen everyone,

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,460
how could you suspect Xing Yun

29
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,620
without any evidence?

30
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,780
And this box.

31
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,180
It is against the law
to detain personal belongings.

32
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,780
This is my idea.

33
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,740
I don't believe Xing Yun will do
such nasty things either,

34
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,180
but we don't know anything yet,

35
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,860
so we have to detain her things first.

36
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
I am the person who is in charge for this instance.

37
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,940
When this kind of thing happened

38
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,980
I admit that I am liable for that.

39
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,700
But what makes you think

40
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,540
I leaked the instance?

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,860
Okay, let's look at this first.

42
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,940
This picture was posted in Moments by Lin Jing

43
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,820
who is from Huize Game.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,740
（Lin Jing: Please take care of me)

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,700
（Lin Jing: Please take care of me)
No, you misunderstood.

46
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
Lin Jing is my classmate in university.

47
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,220
She is also the secretary of the boss from Huize Game.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,140
Am I right?

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,820
Hey, Mr. Duan.

50
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,420
Is your life experience too simple

51
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,740
or do you have an extraordinary imagination?

52
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,220
Who will post that on Moments

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,180
and tell the world after she leaks the instance?

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,820
Can you let Xing Yun explain

55
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,700
what this "Please" mean?

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,140
She's getting married

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,700
and ask me to design the invitation card.

58
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,180
I can prove this.

59
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
I was there when they said it.

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,980
Where are the invitations?

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,260
Right, Xing Yun.

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,300
We don't want to think
that you are the leaker either.

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
With these kind of information,

64
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,580
We have no other choice.

65
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580
(Lin Jing: Tell me your plan some day.
Xing Yun: Alright. Let's talk over coffee.)

66
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,780
Look.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,180
No, she hopes that I can make a wedding plan.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,300
We were really just chatting.

69
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,420
Since I was too busy,

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,940
we haven't seen each other since then.

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,580
It doesn't mean anything.

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,780
Yes, Mr. Duan.

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,420
I think it is just some simple

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,260
business communication.

75
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,820
In my opinion, this is pretty obvious.

76
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,820
He takes a part for the whole.

77
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,860
If you want to tell the secret,

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,980
it could also be people from Jiawo.

79
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,940
Nonsense.

80
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,580
Mr. Xia, you have to give us an answer for this.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,700
Xing Yun has just got better in her career.

82
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,780
She has no reason to do that.

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,420
No reason?

84
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,940
She got an exceptional promotion,

85
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,380
which won't last long at all.

86
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,380
Also, I feel she has been left out recently.

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,900
I think

88
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,180
she might feel that Mr. Xia wanna get rid of her

89
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,060
and find herself an alternative option.

90
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,780
If Xing Yun is really the leaker,

91
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,060
how would she work so hard

92
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,020
on the instance?

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,100
That's right.

94
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,820
Yiyi, say something.

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,660
What do you think?

96
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,380
I... I don't think it is Xing Yun.

97
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,700
The trailer of Huize Game is crudely made.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,700
They have only adopted the basic elements

99
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,740
and put them together.

100
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,860
I think it won't have a huge impact

101
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,020
on the instance to some extent.

102
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,580
Xia Ke, don't be so naive.

103
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,140
Sometimes it is the little ant
that usually trips the elephant.

104
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
It the first time I've heard this.

105
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,980
Mr. Duan, have you been tripped by ants?

106
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,180
He Yu.

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,340
All right, let's listen

108
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,580
and figure out how to support the plan of Mr. Xia.

109
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,980
I will organize a team to revise the instance.

110
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,100
Any elements

111
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,220
in the trailer that are similar
to the contents of our instance

112
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,580
will be adjusted relatively.

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,100
We will still launch the game by the original plan.

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,340
In order to prevent that

115
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,540
there will be another leak,

116
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,180
I will divide the instance team

117
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,260
into three groups that are not connected.

118
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Each of them only knows part of the game.

119
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,180
And Jiawo

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,780
also needs to revise the trailer

121
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,660
and give me a plan to evaluate in the end.

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,020
Write it down.

123
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,540
At last, Xing Yun will be put on paid leave.

124
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,100
Are you out of mind?

125
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,700
How would I leak the instance?

126
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,620
You act like a rebel.

127
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,420
Shut up.

128
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,460
You go home first.

129
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,740
Wait.

130
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,820
There is evidence in this phone.

131
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,100
We cannot give her that.

132
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,420
Mobile phone is personal belonging.

133
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,020
Let's go, Lucky.

134
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,860
Let's go home.

135
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,540
They will regret this.

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,540
Check this.

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,020
All right, don't get upset with those crazy people.

138
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,820
You can quit at the worst.

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,940
Maybe you haven't noticed that

140
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,700
actually I am quite rich.

141
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,780
According to the standard to support you

142
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,900
which you mentioned in the hotel,

143
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,860
I can afford it.

144
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,300
Why doesn't he believe me?

145
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,260
It will be enough that I believe you, isn't it?

146
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,380
At that time, Dongdong's plan

147
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,420
got a relatively high score.

148
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,380
As for the difficulty of development,

149
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
it is simpler than the existing game.

150
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,180
Although it is tough to launch the game on time,

151
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,460
but it won't be delayed too long.

152
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,500
I agree.

153
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,020
Easy path.

154
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,780
You have to be sure of things.

155
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,980
I don't think this is necessary.

156
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,420
Because of a 45 seconds of trailer

157
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,900
made from bits and pieces

158
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,660
it is really not wise to give up the instance

159
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,060
that we have been working so hard.

160
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,980
We will check all problems

161
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,140
and make an evaluation before tomorrow.

162
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,100
Let's do this first.

163
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,900
Xia Ke.

164
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,100
Mr. Sun has given me a clear instruction

165
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,060
that you won't get the next round of investment

166
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,660
If you don't give us a satisfactory answer.

167
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,100
You come back so early today.

168
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,660
Mom, if I didn't have a job

169
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,780
will you dislike me?

170
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
How come?

171
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,220
What's wrong with you?

172
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,140
You lost my job and got fired?

173
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,820
Worse than unemployment,

174
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,460
today I finally realized

175
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,140
what it feels like to be utterly isolated.

176
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,220
Stop being silly.

177
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,140
Your mother is here.

178
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,300
Who left you?

179
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,140
What's going on? Tell me about it.

180
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,820
My boss thinks I am

181
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,540
the traitor who secretly sold our instance

182
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,460
and got me suspended.

183
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,300
I don't have to go to the company from now on.

184
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,180
Is he crazy?

185
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,060
My baby girl will never do things like that.

186
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,580
Right? I feel the same.

187
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,540
He is unable to tell the good from the evil.

188
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
The Farmer and the Viper.

189
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,420
An big idiot who is totally blind.

190
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,620
I agree.

191
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,100
But you don't have to be upset.

192
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,220
It's not a big deal.

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,140
You've been so tired for the last few months.

194
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
You are exhausted.

195
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,500
Have a good rest at home.

196
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,540
But my instance is going to be launched soon.

197
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,340
How could you still think about that instance?

198
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,820
How couldn't I?

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,620
I have worked hard for several months.

200
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,020
Oh.

201
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,300
A person will not become

202
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,060
another stranger by overnight.

203
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,860
What is that old saying?

204
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,300
The leopard cannot change its spots.

205
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,820
what does that mean?

206
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,220
What does this mean?

207
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,620
The friendship between you and your boss,

208
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
do you expect him to change?

209
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,580
If you don't think

210
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,300
you are totally blind,

211
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,900
that is absolutely impossible.

212
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,180
Still busy?

213
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,260
Wait a second.

214
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,620
Hello.

215
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,540
Mr. Xia, the videotape you want

216
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,100
I have already been sent to your email box

217
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,340
according to your request.

218
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,380
Oh, I know now.

219
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,220
Anything else?

220
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,260
I'm afraid you will skip the dinner later,

221
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,180
so I come here to remind you.

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,540
No need, go home.

223
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,780
If you have time to eat downstairs,

224
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,060
just tell me what you want

225
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,980
and I can buy some for you.

226
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,260
It's okay, really.

227
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,140
Mr. Xia.

228
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,380
Miss Yao is here too.

229
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,620
Mr. Xia this is the entry record, have a look.

230
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,100
Xing Yun, give me a cup of coffee.

231
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,580
Amy, give me a cup of coffee.

232
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,740
Good.

233
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,860
Let me join you.

234
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,260
No need.

235
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Leaving aside personal feelings,

236
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,940
I am a bold and cautious person

237
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,620
also a rigorous business partner.

238
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,780
And don't forget

239
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,540
my grades were no worse than yours in college.

240
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,660
Besides, with so many materials,

241
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,140
if you are overwhelmed,

242
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,020
you might miss the important information.

243
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,980
Huize.

244
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,540
Where did I see this before, Huize...

245
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,260
You are really insightful for the game industry,

246
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,660
and you're in charge of such an important job.

247
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
You must be a rare talent.

248
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,100
You can come to me anytime
if you want to change your job.

249
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,180
Thank you for your kindness.

250
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,020
I've seen him.

251
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,220
(Mascot)

252
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,220
(Reply at once)

253
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,540
Fool.

254
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,900
If you don't believe me,
I'll check it by myself.

255
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Wait and see.

256
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,460
(Searching Huize's official website)

257
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,700
You should rest.

258
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,660
I even forgot this.

259
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,820
Actually I think

260
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,260
you don't need to suspend Xing Yun,

261
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,260
even I can't find any reason
why she leaked the secret.

262
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,700
But for now,

263
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,900
she is the biggest suspect.

264
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,100
Why should we do this?

265
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,580
I am going home now.

266
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,980
Just call Lin Jing for me.

267
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
I told you

268
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,180
our company does not receive

269
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,380
any external customer.

270
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,180
If you're looking for her,

271
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,940
you can contact her and meet outside.

272
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,180
But I couldn't contact her.

273
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,180
If you continue to pester us,
I'll call the security.

274
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,260
Hello.

275
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,860
Are you from Huize?

276
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,180
Yes.

277
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,100
Do you know Lin Jing?

278
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,780
Lin Jing again?

279
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,220
Did someone else come to look for her too?

280
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,020
Yes, there was a cute guy

281
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,340
who came to see her.

282
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,140
But she has already taken a vacation

283
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,180
which started the day before yesterday.

284
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,580
Vacation? Where has she gone?

285
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,940
I think she travelled overseas.

286
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,740
Our company recently requested

287
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,180
that we shouldn't talk too much to people outside.

288
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
You'd better go.

289
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,620
I didn't know that you are

290
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,340
such a despicable person at the exhibition.

291
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,860
Miss, do we know each other?

292
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,300
Still pretending?

293
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
Your trailer is made so crudely.

294
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,740
I guess you are not good at

295
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,620
designing games either.

296
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,220
What you have done

297
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,260
will only embarrass your company in the industry.

298
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,020
I just saw there are several stacks of

299
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,900
employee emails on Mr. Xia's table.

300
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,620
It seems that Mr. Xia is really

301
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,620
determined to investigate this matter
completely this time.

302
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,780
That's for sure.

303
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,140
It is such a big leak scandal.

304
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,900
Isn't Xing Yun the leaker?

305
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,380
It seems that they don't have enough evidence.

306
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,660
Maybe after the investigation,

307
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,460
they might find Xing Yun is wronged.

308
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,340
I mean she is the senior employee

309
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,980
who has been working with Mr. Xia since the start.

310
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,460
I don't believe that she is the leaker either.

311
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,020
It couldn't be Lin Jing.

312
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,260
Although she is the secretary of that guy

313
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,260
I didn't tell her anything.

314
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,420
At the exhibition,

315
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,980
I did have a computer with me

316
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,340
but I never left it alone all the time.

317
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,260
Wait... at the venue...

318
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,740
I went to the toilet,

319
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,060
but it only took three minutes.

320
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,500
It is impossible for them to copy the file.

321
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,780
What went wrong? Oh, my God.

322
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,220
Hello.

323
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,340
Oh.

324
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,020
Got it.

325
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,700
She doesn't feel sorry for me

326
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,780
and always asks me to buy groceries.

327
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,220
I was just going up to visit you.

328
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,660
I was guessing which floor do your live on.

329
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,500
There must be a lot of changes
to be done for the marketing plan.

330
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,740
Why are you hanging around here?

331
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,620
I am here to comfort the scapegoat.

332
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
I went to Huize Game.

333
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,980
I was going to find the Lin Jing

334
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,020
and come to explain this.

335
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,140
It turns out that she happened to
go abroad at this time.

336
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,700
She is taking a long vacation.
I couldn't get in touch with her.

337
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
It was you who went to see Lin Jing.

338
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,100
You went too?

339
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,460
Where are you going? I can give you a ride.

340
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,220
No need.

341
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Are you leaving now?

342
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,820
Why don't you take me with you?

343
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,380
Or I can take you with me.

344
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,500
It has been years

345
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,060
that I don't ride my bike outside.

346
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,180
I didn't know you can ride a bike.

347
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,020
Wanna laugh at me?

348
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,980
I am a good guy both domestically and socially.

349
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,700
I can drive a sports car

350
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,340
also enjoy

351
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,580
the romance of riding bicycles.

352
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,060
Hey, watch out.

353
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,540
Are you OK?

354
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,660
Nothing.

355
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,120
(Meeting Room)

356
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,740
It's really challenging to update the content

357
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,860
without changing the structure.

358
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,980
Also the group plan

359
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,060
simply scattered the limited resources again.

360
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,500
It is possible that the traitor

361
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,020
is still in the new team.

362
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,660
If there is another leak of content,

363
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,340
we will know which group the leak is from.

364
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,020
Traitor? Haven't we already sent the traitor home?

365
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,860
Xing Yun must have been wronged.

366
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,140
Mr. Xia is really cold,

367
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,860
Xing Yun is the senior employee no matter what.

368
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,820
Without any evidence,

369
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,460
she just got suspended.

370
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,340
To think like this,

371
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,220
actually there are a lot of people who can

372
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,980
leak the instance.

373
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,700
Think about it.

374
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Apart from these people,

375
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,220
who else is suspicious?

376
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
From the trailer,

377
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,380
they not only copied the small modules

378
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,740
but also stole the contents updated two weeks ago.

379
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,220
Amy.

380
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,380
After you said this,

381
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,660
you are also quite suspicious.

382
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,940
After all, you have access to Mr. Xia's

383
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,300
meeting materials, right?

384
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,700
I have professional ethics, okay?

385
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,060
This is also possible.

386
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,220
You carried a limited edition bag last time.

387
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,100
Did you get it from Mr. He?

388
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,180
I saw that in the cafe.

389
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,460
He also asked you about the progress
of the project, didn't he?

390
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,260
He is our advertising partner.

391
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,740
Is it weird to know the progress?

392
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,060
Why are you so anxious?

393
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,140
Maybe it was really you who leaked the secret.

394
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,860
It shouldn't be.

395
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,380
Is there anyone looking for you?

396
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,700
Hi, the number you dialed is busy.

397
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,060
Please dial it later.

398
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,460
You are the main character this afternoon.

399
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,020
I won't answer anyone's call.

400
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,940
Let's continue.

401
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,300
Apart from these people,

402
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,260
who else is suspicious?

403
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,860
If you think this way,

404
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,100
Amy, Yiyi, Dongdong,

405
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,940
(Plan of Infinite Unknown Love instances)

406
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,500
you, Miss Yao,

407
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,860
Director Wang and Director Li are all possible.

408
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,540
This hurts my brain.

409
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,100
Crushing the instant noodles
is the best way to relax.

410
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,820
I think you can still

411
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,340
focus on the personnel from TIG.

412
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,300
Not to mention professional ethics,

413
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,700
I won't do anything to hurt you.

414
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,460
Yao Qing won't do anything to hurt Xia Ke, either.

415
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,140
Could that be Director Qian?

416
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,460
Although Qian is a little annoying,

417
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,980
he won't get into this trouble,

418
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,060
which also might cause him to lose money.

419
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,380
Excuse me.

420
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
Mr. Wu.

421
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,140
This is my brother.

422
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,700
Brother?

423
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
All boys do this.

424
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,980
They don't wanna admit that.

425
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,700
Yes, yes, it is normal.

426
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,820
I also have a sister.

427
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,220
Hello.

428
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,620
Mr. Wu.

429
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,060
I always wanna tell you

430
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,020
the food was so delicious last time.

431
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,780
Nice. Glad you like it.

432
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,180
By the way, a guy came to see me before,

433
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,620
saying he is recommended by you.

434
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
It's for a game.

435
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,380
What?

436
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,180
As you know, I don't like publicity stunts.

437
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,220
So I was really impolite

438
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
and kicked them out.

439
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,140
Not your acquaintances, right?

440
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,900
What does that man look like?

441
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,420
A man has a light Hong Kong accent.

442
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Huize's boss.

443
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,940
By the way,

444
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,780
there are many good food for kids over there.

445
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,180
You can pick a few for your son.

446
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,380
Good.

447
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,740
Let's check it out for Xiaoxi.

448
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,220
Take your time.

449
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,100
Goodbye, Mr. Wu.

450
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,660
Wait, when did Xiaoxi become your son?

451
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,820
Save it.

452
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,740
What are you doing?

453
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,500
What's the matter?

454
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,100
Isn't it normal for a brother to hug his sister?

455
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,820
Mr. Wu is watching.

456
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,040
Mr. Xia, I did some research on

457
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,780
that Mr. Yang from Huize

458
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,180
who has a poor reputation.

459
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,460
He is notorious for making quick buck.

460
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,220
As for now,

461
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,420
they don't seem to know

462
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,740
our marketing plan yet.

463
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,980
The essential part of the game
is the use of fragments of time.

464
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,940
They just simply copied the template,

465
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
and their software development seems
to be quite lagging behind.

466
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,460
The small module seems easy

467
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,420
but if it is not good enough,

468
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,140
It might look like
a mix of children's puzzle games.

469
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,780
Every game must serve the plot-line.

470
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,620
That only makes sense.

471
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,100
And about three groups for updating the instance,

472
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,060
they are also making some progress.

473
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,300
It won't take a long time

474
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,820
for them to present a basic plan.

475
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,260
By the way, the investigation of the leak...

476
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,500
It will take some time.

477
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,140
Mr. Xia,

478
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,500
I have been working with Xing Yun,

479
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,820
and I really think she is a good girl

480
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,380
who is hardworking

481
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,820
virtuous and honorable.

482
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,140
I don't believe that she will do such things.

483
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,780
To be honest,

484
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,820
the whole company is having
a lot of rumors about this.

485
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,300
A senior employee had such a scandal.

486
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,580
Even if she returns to work,

487
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,340
it's still not good for her reputation.

488
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,940
In fact, I heard people from industry

489
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,060
that Xing Yun went to see Huize's boss Mr. Yang
a few days ago.

490
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,580
Yiyi.

491
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,740
Why did you come?

492
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,220
I have something to tell you.

493
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,700
Mr. He is here too.

494
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,900
I just came here to comfort her.

495
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,180
You ladies can talk here.

496
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm leaving now.

497
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,180
Let me take this.

498
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,740
Lucky, I'll see you tomorrow.

499
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,460
Don't.

500
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,420
Let's talk upstairs.

501
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,660
Here.

502
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,940
Thank you.

503
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,740
Xing Yun, actually I have something to tell you.

504
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,420
That is...

505
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,780
What? You make me so nervous.

506
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,900
In fact, I was the one who leaked the instance.

507
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,380
No, I mean, it could be me.

508
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,820
In fact, I was helping you look for

509
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
the top ten dating places.

510
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,700
I emailed the editor of that magazine

511
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,500
who said he was a fan of Infinite.

512
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,100
And we really hit it off.

513
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,100
-So... -So?

514
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,420
So I said a little bit too much.

515
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,780
I told him that we were making the newest instance

516
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,780
that might adopt the information
from famous dating places.

517
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,500
How much information did you give?

518
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,380
Enough to make this trailer.

519
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,980
Did you tell Mr. Xia?

520
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,700
Not yet.

521
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,980
I want to tell you first.

522
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,300
After all, you took the blame for me this time.

523
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,620
I have already thought about it.

524
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,300
Tomorrow I will go and tell Mr. Xia.

525
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,980
Anyway, I am ready to be fired.

526
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,980
If I leave the TIG,

527
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,180
will we still be good friends?

528
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,060
Don't over-think.

529
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,180
You didn't mean to.

530
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,460
Besides, how can a magazine editor

531
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,620
know people from Huize and leak the instance?

532
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,900
You shouldn't over-think.

533
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,300
No.

534
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,420
Amy.

535
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,180
Hello.

536
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,420
Yiyi, do you have Xing Yun's phone number?

537
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,140
I'm at her house.

538
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,620
Amy.

539
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,180
Hello, Amy.

540
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,180
Xing Yun, have you met Mr. He today?

541
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,540
I just saw him this afternoon.

542
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,260
What's the matter?

543
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,060
So he didn't answer my phone on purpose.

544
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,300
It is very suspicious.

545
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,380
What does that mean?

546
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,140
Did you find any clue?

547
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,980
Not yet.

548
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,220
I have checked copywriter and test staff.

549
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,380
There is no suspicious things.

550
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,780
Why don't you doubt me?

551
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,420
You won't do such a thing.

552
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,620
It's hard to say.

553
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,660
Think about it.

554
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,700
I have so much to gain and nothing to lose.

555
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,660
I can take Lucky away from you.

556
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,100
I supported her when she was surrounded by enemies.

557
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,700
We even went to the supermarket

558
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,580
and did the grocery shopping like couple.

559
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
Nervous?

560
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,700
If you can win her heart

561
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,660
by doing shopping with her.

562
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,660
You won't waste time on fireworks at night.

563
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,100
Not to mention that you came here
to challenge me at this time.

564
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,060
Alright.

565
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,340
Yao Qing is busy.

566
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,460
I'm here to bring you food.

567
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Yao Qing is talented and brilliant.

568
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,980
She is perfect for you.

569
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,340
Why don't you think about it?

570
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,700
Come in.

571
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Mr. Xia,

572
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,100
I think it could be me who leaked the instance.

573
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,580
So?

574
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,780
Mr. Xia said

575
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,820
he has already found my e-mail information.

576
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
He's already asked people from security department

577
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,060
to investigate them.

578
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,740
They have any suspicion at present.

579
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,660
Let me go back to work.

580
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,220
Great.

581
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,140
I told you, you are over-thinking.

582
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,980
Besides, he particularly asked me about you

583
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,340
before I left.

584
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,380
Would he even care

585
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,620
the life of traitor now?

586
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,220
In fact, nobody believes
that you leaked the instance.

587
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Don't worry.

588
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,540
The truth will come out one day.

589
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,040
(Shen Qing: Hi, what's up?
Can you do me a favour?)

590
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,740
I'm really sorry.

591
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,540
Our studio is really busy recently.

592
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,220
Let you come to help.

593
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,260
It's okay. I have nothing to do at home anyway.

594
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,940
I've heard all about it.

595
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,260
How can Xia Ke

596
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,980
make you suspended?

597
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,020
Don't say that.

598
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,580
I will send it to the address you gave me.

599
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,220
That's it?

600
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,580
I am leaving now.

601
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,340
Take your time.

602
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,420
Since you are free,

603
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,500
I can go home now.

604
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,540
I don't know the way.

605
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,100
You can follow the GPS.

606
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,060
I was in a rush and forgot my phone.

607
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,020
I don't understand.

608
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,620
You...

609
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,780
Forget it. Let's go.

610
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,140
How are you doing?

611
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,620
Yeah, it's wonderful.

612
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,980
I am super comfortable.

613
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,740
I don't have to go to work but still get paid.

614
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,380
I don't have to be anyone's assistant.

615
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,820
I don't have to work overtime.

616
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,740
I sleep more than ten hours a day.

617
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,060
In addition to watching soap operas
and reading comics,

618
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,580
I'm also busy hanging out
with my dear friends

619
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,900
who always buy me dinner.

620
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,500
If I still complain

621
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
a life like this,

622
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,620
then other people must

623
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,700
live in the hell.

624
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,180
I trust you.

625
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,820
Of course I know that you are not a leaker.

626
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
But there is still someone
who has sold our instance.

627
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,500
Only when we find him out

628
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,180
can I protect you.

629
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,300
So your temporary suspension

630
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,500
is meant to make the real leaker

631
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,380
put his guard down,

632
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,580
so he will give the game away.

633
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,580
Did you find anything?

634
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,460
Not yet.

635
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,180
How do you have time to deliver cakes?

636
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,180
What about the launch of instance?

637
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,300
Do you want to redo it?

638
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,180
We have worked hard on this for such a long time.

639
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,300
Is it in vain now ?

640
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,940
You're not angry now.

641
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,060
Of course I am angry.

642
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,580
Even if you have any plans,

643
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,260
you can tell me at least.

644
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,980
You left your cell phone in the conference room.

645
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,180
What do you want me to tell you?

646
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,380
But...

647
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
But yesterday

648
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,060
I logged into my WeChat.

649
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,540
I really didn't expect that.

650
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,780
You should have come to me earlier.

651
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Then I would like to ask you,

652
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,180
if I had come to see you earlier,

653
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,700
can you have such a good time these days?

654
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,420
I don't know

655
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,620
there are still such beautiful places in the suburbs.

656
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,860
Do you want to live here?

657
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,780
If a large family lives here

658
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,820
it must be very happy.

659
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,100
But there are only three people in my family.

660
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,220
It will be too quiet and distant to live here.

661
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,740
Yes, the real home

662
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,260
doesn't depend on the size of building.

663
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,380
I'll get the cake and you ring the doorbell.

664
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,020
Oh.

665
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,340
Please put the cake on the table.

666
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,700
Mrs. Zhang, listen.

667
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,940
There are two different flavors in each box.

668
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,820
This is matcha and chocolate.

669
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,100
This is red velvet and mango.

670
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,020
I have a card for you

671
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,900
with all the information here.

672
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,700
So many flavors.

673
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,060
I don't know this. My son ordered it for me.

674
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,460
Let's put them into refrigerator first.

675
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,100
Good.

676
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,500
This cake should be kept around 0 to 4 degrees.

677
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,460
The taste is the best.

678
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,340
If it's alright we are gonna leave now.

679
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,540
Don't leave, at least have a cup of tea.

680
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,820
This is the fruit tea I just made.

681
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,660
I live in this house alone.

682
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,700
It's good but just too lonely.

683
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,260
I was waiting for your guys to come over

684
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,140
to talk with me and keep me company.

685
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,220
Come on.

686
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Look, if you add some dark green

687
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,580
on this part of apple,

688
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,540
it will look like it's not ripe yet.

689
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,620
Right, it's more vivid now.

690
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,980
How could a cake delivery girl

691
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,220
be so talented and smart?

692
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,460
I just came to help today.

693
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,060
I usually work in a game company.

694
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,700
No wonder you are different from those people.

695
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,020
That young man

696
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,380
also seems not an ordinary people.

697
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,060
He is really good-looking.

698
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,380
Him? This is his first time to do customer service.

699
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,500
He is usually served by others.

700
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,940
Mrs. Zhang, your son bought you so many cakes.

701
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,620
He is so nice.

702
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,620
He booked them for friends from the car club.

703
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,420
That's why.

704
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,580
Let me tell you.

705
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,180
My son recently bought a Mercedes

706
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,980
and joined the car club.

707
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,420
He plays with these car buddies every day.

708
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,860
He is going to see a ballet tonight.

709
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,380
It's a ticket from 4S store.

710
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,900
It is a Hungarian ballet group.

711
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,660
I said you don't like dancing or music.

712
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,180
He just told me

713
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,300
he met a girl in the car club.

714
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,700
Is Hungary Dance group performing the Swan Lake?

715
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,460
You even know this.

716
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,500
No, I heard what others said.

717
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,820
What are you thinking?

718
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,620
Benz.

719
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,580
Do you want to buy a car?

720
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,300
No.

721
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,860
Mr. Xia, can I go to

722
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,220
the nearest Mercedes 4S store?

723
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,020
This is the new model we launched this year.

724
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,780
The minimum set is 256,800 yuan.

725
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,100
There are also sports, deluxe and exclusive editions.

726
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,340
The free ticket of Swan Lake you asked before

727
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,860
is designed for the owners of this type of cars.

728
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,460
But the performance is tonight.

729
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,940
I'm afraid you won't be able to make it.

730
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,460
I want to make sure:

731
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,540
Does your company buy the whole performance?

732
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,500
That's right.

733
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,700
Can I think that

734
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,860
those who got the tickets

735
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,020
are all owners who have recently bought this car.

736
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,460
Yes, it must be the owner who purchased this car
in the last three months.

737
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,180
Each owner can bring one friend.

738
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,180
Where do tickets come from?

739
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,340
It was sent from the ticketing center.

740
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,340
Thank you.

741
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,500
Do you want to buy a car

742
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,660
or see the performance?

743
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,660
According to her words,

744
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,500
tickets are sent to car owners from the ticketing center.

745
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,620
But those who get tickets

746
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,900
have to be the car owners who bought the car
in recent three months.

747
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,460
Is this very difficult to understand?

748
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,100
There is such an owner in our company.

749
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,780
Who?

750
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,780
Dabai.

751
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,140
Xing Yun here you are.

752
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,940
Thank you.

753
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,620
Dabai? Who is Dabai?

754
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,500
Whose package has the receiver called Dabai?

755
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,300
Mengmeng, are you sure?

756
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,140
There is no Dabai in our company.

757
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,660
No.

758
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,740
Look, it's right here.

759
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,360
Is the address of our company?

760
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,860
(Swan Lake ticket for Dabai in TIG)
]Is the address of our company?

761
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,060
(Swan Lake ticket for Dabai in TIG)

762
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,560
(Swan Lake ticket for Dabai in TIG)
Swan lake.

763
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,500
Swan lake.

764
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,180
I know this.

765
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,580
My husband's cousin has learned dancing.

766
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,260
She loves this dance group.

767
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,140
Mengmeng asked for a long time.

768
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,660
She also asked it in the company group.

769
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,940
But no one claimed it.

770
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,420
After you said so,

771
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,580
I kind of remember now.

772
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,620
But after a few days,

773
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,180
the ticket was gone.

774
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,220
I think that Dabai

775
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,860
sneaked away the ticket from the front desk.

776
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,900
So what's your point?

777
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,700
I didn't feel anything at that time either.

778
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,980
But now think about it.

779
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,020
Why didn't he wanna admit it in public?

780
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,700
Instead, he got it in a sneaky way.

781
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,140
That means he doesn't want anyone
to know about it.

782
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,580
If you say so,

783
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,580
wouldn't it be better
if he didn't use the company's address?

784
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,420
Maybe it is not convenient to have delivery
at the place he lives.

785
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,780
He had to use the company's address.

786
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,860
He had to use a fake name.

787
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,780
This is quite reasonable.

788
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,620
It is really weird that someone bought a car

789
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,020
but didn't want to admit that, isn't it?

790
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,860
Leave the investigation to me.

791
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,060
Go back and rest.

792
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,820
Don't think about anything.

793
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,540
You should have a good rest.

794
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,220
It's time to shave, Mr. Xia.

795
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,220
I'll go first.

796
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,980
Mom, Dad, have some fruit.

797
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,300
The girl was some upset two days ago.

798
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,700
How did you become a different person

799
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,380
after delivering the cake?

800
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,340
What are you going to deal with your company?

801
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,220
Deal with what?

802
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,300
I think it's time to quit.

803
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,340
My daughter is so awesome.

804
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,740
She can find a good job anywhere.

805
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,780
They treat you so unfairly.

806
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,900
Dad, I am not gonna quit.

807
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,740
Quitting means I'm guilty?

808
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,940
Mr. Xia said he believed me

809
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,180
and I believe that

810
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,900
he will be able to help me find out the truth.

811
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,500
Weird.

812
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,620
You were still cursing that Mr. Xia two days ago.

813
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,340
Like cannot tell good from evil.

814
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,540
Totally blind.

815
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,300
Why are you speaking for him today?

816
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,180
Is it?

817
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,980
Did I say that?

818
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,740
Yes.

819
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,140
Mr. Xia is having a hard time.

820
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,060
There is such a big leak on his project.

821
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,780
He not only needs to revise the instance

822
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,980
and trailer,

823
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,060
but also has to find out the truth.

824
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
No, it's my own business.

825
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,300
I have to do something.

826
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,580
I am going back to my room now.

827
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,300
Enjoy this.

828
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,740
They are sweet.

829
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,340
Look this girl. She is so crazy now.

830
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,460
These are people from the project group
who are accessible to the instance.

831
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,380
They are all here now.

832
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,580
Take a card, everyone.

833
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,260
Dongdong, you first.

834
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,500
Me first?

835
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,900
Are you kidding me?

836
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,020
What truth do you want to prove
with these pieces of paper?

837
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,140
Are you afraid?

838
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,420
You are hiding some secrets if you are afraid.

839
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,500
Am I afraid?

840
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,940
It's just a card.

841
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,980
Hurry up.

842
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,620
Could you please keep an eye on the road?

843
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,900
Mr. Xia?

844
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Are you hot dressing like this?

845
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,180
I don't want my colleagues to recognize me.

846
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,280
Let's go.

847
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,540
Tell me about the investigation.

848
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,780
I have already investigated all our employees' cars

849
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,820
in the parking lot.

850
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,740
Three of them are Mercedes-Benz.

851
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,540
But none of them is this year's new edition.

852
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,780
And I also asked the parking lot staff.

853
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,300
Recently, none of our employees

854
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,900
was applying a new parking permit.

855
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,020
If you were bribed with a car,

856
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,260
will you drive it to the company?

857
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
(Doing tarot cards and observing the surveillance camera
to find the suspect)

858
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,620
Yiyi,

859
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,340
how do I feel this method

860
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,420
is so weird?

861
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,460
This tarot card is superstitious by itself.

862
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,820
I just use it as a cover.

863
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,980
I hope that the guilty one can give himself away.

864
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,940
Hu, do you make any progress?

865
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,540
According to your requirements,

866
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,420
I have checked

867
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,740
everyone who gets tarot cards

868
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,660
from the security camera.

869
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,100
There are seven of them

870
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,380
who searched content related to tarot cards.

871
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,020
Using tarot cards to catch the leaker

872
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,220
already sounds

873
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,900
really unreal and crazy.

874
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,180
But people who are hiding secrets

875
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,860
will be frightened by a gust of wind.

876
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,260
So the person who believes this most

877
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,500
is also the most suspicious one.

878
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,620
The most suspect one is among these seven people.

879
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,460
There is only one person who is the most suspected.

880
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,420
Although seven people searched the tarot cards,

881
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,300
this person's key words

882
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,940
are traitors, spies and snitches.

883
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,620
Who is it?

884
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,180
Wait.

885
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,700
Dongdong, what happened to this lazy-bone?

886
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,060
He didn't take a taxi home.

887
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,420
Does he often take a taxi?

888
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,620
Everyday.

889
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,980
He is always talking about

890
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,900
that yellow sharing bike is the lowest thing.

891
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,340
Fake.

892
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,420
Dongdong.

893
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,700
Dongdong.

894
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,140
Put it down.

895
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,220
If you want me to help you,

896
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,660
you should bring me the details at least.

897
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,020
After I read it

898
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,820
I might know how they will make things difficult for you.

899
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,340
I am thirsty.

900
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,220
Can you buy me another cup of soy latte?

901
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,060
No problem.

902
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,620
I'll watch the details for you first.

903
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,120
(Plan of Infinite Unknown Love instances)

904
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,820
Dongdong joined the project team pretty late.

905
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,460
When assessing the details of games,

906
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,020
I asked him to check the game for me.

907
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,140
In this way,

908
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,420
he knew the whole project very well.

909
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,220
It couldn't be him.

910
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,740
Dongdong is one of the main creators of Infinite.

911
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,380
If there is a problem with the instance project,

912
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,900
the plotline games will also be affected.

913
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,220
He wouldn't do that.

914
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,580
At this time we should pay attention to anyone

915
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,140
who has abnormal behavior.
