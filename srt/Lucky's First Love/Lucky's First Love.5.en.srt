00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,580
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,000
So,

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,020
you've changed your mind?

5
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,660
-Mr. Xia! -Mr. Xia.

6
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,740
Is Shen Qing okay?

7
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,020
I think you've drunk more than her.

8
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,460
I just drank a little.

9
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,860
Mr. Xia, what do you think of her makeup?

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,980
Ugly.

11
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,420
Ugly?

12
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,620
Did I mishear him?

13
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,900
It's not ugly.

14
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,460
Am I ugly?

15
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,620
Wine. I want wine!

16
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,660
Wine!

17
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,180
It's not wine. I want wine.

18
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,140
You're back.

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,500
Do you want to watch TV with me?

20
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,500
Is there anything on my face?

21
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,660
No.

22
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,620
I'm back too early,

23
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,700
so you don't have time to get ready, right?

24
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,300
No.

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,940
It's just I think I'm myself when I dress like this.

26
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,420
Do I let you down?

27
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,780
That's what makes you cute.

28
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,620
What was on your mind?

29
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,100
I was thinking

30
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
my parents must like such an atmosphere.

31
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,300
You've experienced little romantic
attraction to others.

32
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,500
I don't think

33
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,020
you've got lots of romantic feelings.

34
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,300
We'll have to get closer to each other
sooner or later, right?

35
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,380
I'm sorry.

36
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,660
We'd better not do it
until it's on our wedding night.

37
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,380
Exactly. You took the words out of my mouth.

38
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,620
We have a tacit understanding.

39
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,780
The room is big.

40
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,060
The sofa is cosy.

41
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,660
I'll sleep on it tonight.

42
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,900
I've heard the swimming pool here is beautiful.

43
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,820
I'm going to have a swim.

44
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,580
If you want to subdue a bad guy at one go,

45
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,740
the simplest way is to kick him in his crotch.

46
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,620
Good memory.

47
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,100
Mr. Xia.

48
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,780
It's you. Why didn't you say anything?

49
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,860
It's late.

50
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,180
I'm curious about
where you're going for an adventure.

51
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,620
Don't mention it.

52
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,380
I want to go to the swimming pool,
but I'm lost.

53
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,820
Are you going to swim like this?

54
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,780
Follow me.

55
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
It's late and you've drunk a lot.

56
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,020
Where are you going?

57
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,700
Mr. Chu, it's none of your business.

58
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,500
You have no idea

59
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,580
why I did all this.

60
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,060
It's beautiful.

61
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,180
Mr. Xia, you're amazing.

62
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,980
You grasped my foot so easily.

63
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,660
It's because you're bad at it.

64
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,060
You taught me to do that.

65
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,860
You said the simplest way to defend myself
is to kick a man in his crotch.

66
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,340
My mind went blank just now.

67
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,460
That's all I can remember.

68
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,620
Why didn't you think of your boyfriend

69
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,860
at such a critical moment?

70
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,740
I just didn't.

71
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Maybe Chu Nan is too gentle.

72
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,180
In case of an emergency,

73
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,420
a strong and tough man like you

74
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,540
can give me more strength.

75
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
I'm telling you.

76
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,740
Now that he let you wander alone at late night,

77
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,300
either he or you

78
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,380
are an idiot.

79
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,220
It's mutual respect. Okay?

80
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,300
I think he's just your teammate

81
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,740
instead of a boyfriend.

82
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,660
Your task is to enter a relationship.

83
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Really?

84
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,740
Do you like him?

85
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,060
Of course.

86
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,060
He's good-tempered and polite.

87
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,740
I feel good when I'm with him.

88
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,900
I've never seen him get mad.

89
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,700
Okay. Let's do an experiment.

90
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
What experiment?

91
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,020
Generally,

92
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,500
when a woman falls in love with a man,

93
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,420
she won't be attracted by anyone else.

94
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,380
I think so.

95
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,500
Don't move.

96
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,020
Are you parched?

97
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
No.

98
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,300
Is your heart beating fast?

99
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,700
No.

100
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,740
So, why do you go red?

101
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,540
I feel hot. It's hot.

102
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,340
Look at me.

103
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,300
Did you think I was going to kiss you?

104
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,100
You don't love Chu Nan at all.

105
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,020
When I was pretending to kiss you,

106
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,820
you didn't try to avoid or refuse it.

107
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,380
Instead, you were going to accept it.

108
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
I was not.

109
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,780
So, why did you close your eyes?

110
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,780
I didn't!

111
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,740
It's just my eyes are dry.

112
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,620
Stay away from me!

113
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,020
Why are you so careless?

114
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,580
Get out of the pool!

115
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,380
Come on.

116
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,620
Don't touch me.

117
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,100
Do you know the way back?

118
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,340
I won't let you go anywhere.

119
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Let go of me.

120
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,620
What are you doing?

121
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,900
I'm telling you.

122
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,020
I won't let you ask for leave
because of catching a cold.

123
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,660
Go back.

124
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,220
Mr. Xia, can I

125
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,260
have another room?

126
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,660
A standard one is okay.

127
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,060
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

128
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,780
Oh, no!

129
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

130
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,540
You won't deduct it

131
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,260
from my salary or bonus, right?

132
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,420
Xia Ke, something has happened to Xiaoxi.

133
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,900
What's wrong?

134
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,300
I think his leg is injured.

135
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,260
I have to go back.

136
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,660
Let's go.

137
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Your employees need you.

138
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,460
Let me go back with her.

139
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,820
Chu Nan…

140
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,540
Xing Yun, something has happened to my family.

141
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,580
I have to go back.

142
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,140
I met Shen Qing on the way.

143
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,380
I think we can go back together.

144
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,540
Oh.

145
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,380
Both of you drank a lot.

146
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,500
I'll try to get a designated driver for you.

147
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,620
Go back.

148
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,100
I hope Xiaoxi is alright.

149
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,820
I have to call Chu Nan

150
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,660
and ask him to take Shen Qing to hospital.

151
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,860
It's none of your business.

152
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm just worried about your sister.

153
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,860
It's of no use.

154
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,260
Have a good night's sleep.
Don't think too much.

155
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,580
As expected, it's better

156
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,820
to have a hotel room alone.

157
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,900
I wonder what has happened to Chu Nan's family.

158
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,340
Don't cry, Xiaoxi.

159
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,500
Mom!

161
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,820
Miss Shen, you're finally here.

162
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Where is the doctor?

163
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,060
He asked us to wait here.

164
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,780
Xiaoxi had an X-ray. His leg is broken.

165
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,300
He has to have an operation

166
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,740
to remove broken glass from wounds.

167
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,300
The doctor on duty said

168
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,860
we have to wait till his superior
finishes the current operation.

169
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,500
What are you waiting for?

170
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,540
Why don't you go to other hospitals?

171
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,620
The ambulance took us here.

172
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,100
I don't know what to do.

173
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,460
Calm down. I'll figure it out.

174
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,300
Miss Shen, it's really not my fault.

175
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,620
He went to the kitchen

176
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,980
for chocolate without letting me know.

177
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
You can go back.

178
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,340
Does it hurt?

179
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,980
I didn't cry.

180
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Tears come out of my eyes themselves.

181
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Good boy.

182
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,820
You're strong.

183
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,580
Those who're more seriously injured
have to be treated first.

184
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,700
The doctor will come and cure you soon.

185
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,100
Where is he?

186
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,580
Look. There are so many patients here.

187
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,500
They're suffering, too, right?

188
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,500
My legs also hurt.

189
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,540
Be patient.

190
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,740
The doctor will be here

191
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,940
and treat you soon.

192
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,100
Mom, please come here and help her son.

193
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,700
Please!

194
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,740
You don't love Chu Nan at all.

195
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,740
When I was pretending to kiss you,

196
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,540
you didn't try to avoid or refuse it.

197
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,340
Instead, you were going to accept it.

198
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,340
(The signs of a girl falling in love)

199
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,300
Your eyes will shine
when you look at someone you love.

200
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,020
You can't pretend or deny it

201
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,780
because it's an instinct.

202
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,180
What does it mean by shining eyes?

203
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,660
I think it depends on
the location of light sources.

204
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,540
Get an operation room ready.

205
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,700
What on earth am I doing?

206
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,460
Xiaoxi will be alright. Don't worry.

207
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,460
I shouldn't have stayed at the hotel.

208
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,700
Shen Qing, it's not your fault.

209
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,220
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

210
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,220
Mom, how is it going?

211
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,540
As the director, she did it herself.

212
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,540
There is nothing to worry about.

213
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,860
The wounds have been treated very carefully.

214
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,180
Thank you, mom.

215
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,460
I've treated him.

216
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,940
But as for the two of you,

217
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,740
the answer is still no.

218
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,940
Trust me.

219
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,380
I won't bother you again.

220
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,100
We'll go to a private hospital
when my son wakes up.

221
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,300
Xiaoxi needs more nursing care
in the coming days.

222
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,780
Here is one of the best hospitals,

223
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,540
with more experiences and resources.

224
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,740
You'd better stay here.

225
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,460
Private hospitals

226
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,300
are no match for us as for medical skills.

227
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
Don't do silly things.

228
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,260
You'll regret it

229
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,540
if his legs are scarred.

230
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,580
Go arrange for a ward.

231
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,980
If you really care about Xiaoxi,

232
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,780
just think about where you were

233
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,580
when he was injured.

234
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,020
Mom.

235
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,260
I'll wake Xing Yun up.

236
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,060
Hold on.

237
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,540
What's up?

238
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,500
Don't disturb.

239
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,420
It seems they haven't got up.

240
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,700
They even missed their breakfast.

241
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,500
They must have stayed up late.

242
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm afraid she'll fall asleep

243
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,420
when she plays Paintball.

244
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,500
She has to join us,
or it'll be considered an absence from work.

245
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,100
Let's listen. Maybe they've left.

246
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,820
Why are you here?

247
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,060
I hope we didn't bother you.

248
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,300
We're here just to ask you
to have breakfast.

249
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,900
Where is Chu Nan?

250
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,740
There was an emergency
and he left last night.

251
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,340
What? He left?

252
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,020
So, did you sleep alone

253
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,100
last night?

254
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,940
Oh. Come on.

255
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,540
A waste of my efforts!

256
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,660
It's said Shen Qing went back, too.

257
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,940
Her son is injured.

258
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,780
She went back last night.

259
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Both of them went back?

260
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,220
Yeah. In the same car.

261
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,460
She's not as simple as we think.

262
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,380
She runs a bakery alone.

263
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,140
And as a single mother,

264
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,860
she's still living a beautiful life.

265
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,420
So what?

266
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
If I were a man,

267
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,940
I'd fall in love with Xing Yun.

268
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,020
Don't think too much.

269
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,580
I didn't. It's pure coincidence.

270
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,460
We have to meet downstairs in five minutes.

271
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,060
Hurry up!

272
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,020
Mr. Xia will get mad at us.

273
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,820
Hurry up.

274
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,660
Xing Yun is asleep.

275
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,860
Keep it lower. To make her nose look bigger.

276
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,660
Hey. Look!

277
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Isn't that Xing Yun?

278
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,740
It's a live stream.

279
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,220
Well.

280
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,020
She's really sexy in that dress, right?

281
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,580
Xing Yun, wake up!

282
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,180
What's up?

283
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,780
Look. You're a celebrity.

284
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,860
You're an online celebrity.

285
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,500
With over 10,000 clicks.

286
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,420
It was not the case this morning.

287
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,260
It's drawn so much attention.

288
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Hold on.

289
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,900
Over 1,000 comments.

290
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,940
Her facial expressions are interesting!

291
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,220
Amy, how can you post it online?

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,780
Delete it!

293
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,300
No way.

294
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,900
Delete it!

295
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,420
No way!

296
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,820
I've got several thousand more fans.

297
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,860
I'd never delete it.

298
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,060
No way!

299
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,500
Delete it or not?

300
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,820
No!

301
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,260
Delete it!

302
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,100
No!

303
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,580
Mr. Xia.

304
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,540
Mr. Xia, help me delete it.

305
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,260
Mr. Xia.

306
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,740
You can't do that.

307
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,420
Do it for me, Mr. Xia.

308
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,380
No. Mr. Xia.

309
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,540
Video reading error.

310
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,820
It's deleted.

311
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,780
Hooray, Mr. Xia.

312
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,220
You're really the embodiment of justice.

313
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,980
Shame on you.

314
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,340
Xing Yun,

315
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,940
why did Chu Nan suddenly leave?

316
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,460
An emergency has come up.

317
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,100
He had a personal emergency.

318
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,740
How about Shen Qing?

319
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,540
Her son is injured.

320
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,780
Dongdong,

321
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,180
are you trying to stir up trouble?

322
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,820
It's annoying. Got it?

323
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,660
You know nothing.

324
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,900
Xing Yun has never been in a relationship.

325
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,500
She has no combat experience at all.

326
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,020
As an experienced hand,

327
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
I should give her some advice,

328
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,420
right?

329
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,380
Thank you,

330
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,500
but Chu Nan is not that kind of man.

331
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,100
Besides, as for my combat experience,

332
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,180
you'll know it

333
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,860
when we play Paintball.

334
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,580
Amy.

335
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,740
Mr. Xia, what else can I do for you?

336
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,860
Tell everyone

337
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,140
the winner of Paintball

338
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,180
will have three days of paid leave

339
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
and a cash bonus of RMB 10,000.

340
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Did you hear what Mr. Xia said?

341
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,020
Come on.

342
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,060
Paid leave with a bonus!

343
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,460
I'm sure the Paintball

344
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,420
will be fiercely competitive.

345
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Look at you guys!

346
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,020
(Shen Qing: The operation is successful.
Xiaoxi is fine now.)

347
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,980
Welcome to

348
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,420
“Real Man” Paintball Center!

349
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,060
Welcome!

350
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,260
(Lots box)

351
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,380
You'll be divided into groups by drawing lots.

352
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,100
The two with paper of the same color
will be a team.

353
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,020
The game will start in 10 minutes.

354
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,940
Yellow.

355
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,460
Yellow.

356
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,700
We're bound to win!

357
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,020
Let's go!

358
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,340
Go!

359
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,820
Great!

360
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,060
Let's go!

361
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,220
I helped you a lot last night.

362
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,260
You must want to do something
for you in return, right?

363
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,620
You should say sorry first.

364
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,940
You posted the video online
without my permission.

365
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,980
Forgive me, please.

366
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Can you do me a favor?

367
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,700
What's up?

368
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,860
"The Star Signs" said

369
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,580
red is my lucky color today.

370
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,260
Can I trade them with you?

371
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,100
Do you know what's my lucky color?

372
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,740
Mengmeng, we're a team.

373
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,340
Good luck! Go.

374
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,780
I haven't said yes.

375
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,620
Mr. Xia, what a coincidence!

376
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,180
Want paid leave?

377
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,740
Of course! Are you sure we can do it?

378
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,780
Just be smart and don't be a drag on me.

379
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,420
Everyone is equal on the battlefield.

380
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,540
Those guys will take advantage of this chance

381
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,620
to vent their anger.

382
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm afraid you'll be a drag on me.

383
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,380
What did you say?

384
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,700
Nothing. I said I'll protect you.

385
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,420
Mr. Xia, can't you be more serious?

386
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,820
Do you know what's the secret to

387
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,500
winning the game?

388
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,260
The secret?

389
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,220
Running fast, marksmanship

390
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,900
or quick response.

391
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,540
First, don't shoot aimlessly.

392
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,180
Observe carefully

393
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,060
and take aim

394
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,260
before you shoot.

395
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,300
Mr. Xia!

396
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,780
Second, know a teammate from an enemy.

397
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,780
You!

398
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
We're a team!

399
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,620
The white team is out.

400
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,380
Third, don't be confused
by what you hear and see.

401
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,340
Xing Yun!

402
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Xing Yun, you hit me even in this way.

403
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,540
You're so lucky.

404
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,580
Mr. Xia, I think your secret

405
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,820
is more useful for those unlucky guys.

406
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,060
The red team is out!

407
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,100
Yun.

408
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,300
Go!

409
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,020
Can't you tell me about it
before you use me as bait?

410
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,780
What if I get shot?

411
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,820
My bonus!

412
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,820
You're really a weak teammate!

413
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,980
Let's outflank

414
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,020
and defeat him.

415
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,500
Hurry up!

416
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,660
OMG!

417
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,220
I got you.

418
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,660
You scared me.

419
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,100
Do you want me to shoot you

420
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,220
or hit you with the gunstock?

421
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,620
Will you speak ill of Chu Nan again?

422
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,860
Xing Yun, do you bear a grudge
against me because of that?

423
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,460
Well. I give in.

424
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,900
Don't do that.

425
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,900
You give in?

426
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Say something to fawn on me.

427
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,460
You're the prettiest girl in the world.

428
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,300
The planning schemes made by you

429
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,940
will all be adopted.

430
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,380
You're the most capable person in the company.

431
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,060
No one is more awesome than you.

432
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,500
Mr. Xia.

433
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,900
The yellow team is out!

434
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,380
Only the green team and the pink one
are still fighting.

435
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,100
Let's see

436
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,900
who will be the winner.

437
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,580
You said I'm a weak teammate.

438
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,620
You're out, too.

439
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,580
Even so, I'm more capable than you.

440
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,540
Mr. Xia, I'll divert their attention.

441
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,740
What's going on?

442
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,900
Mr. Xia.

443
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,060
Mr. Xia.

444
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,940
Mr. Xia, are you okay?

445
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,900
Don't be stupefied. Shoot them.

446
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,060
I'll leave it to you.

447
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,140
Stop it. Get the doctor here.

448
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,060
If anything happens to Mr. Xia,

449
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,940
you'll lose your job!

450
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,540
That's right. Hurry up.

451
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,780
Hold on. Mr. Xia.

452
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,420
Mr. Xia.

453
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,660
Xing Yun, you're good at playacting.

454
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,740
Exactly. Xing Yun.

455
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,220
You're making a fool of us, right?

456
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,780
Nothing has happened to Mr. Xia.

457
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,500
Mr. Xia, how can you win

458
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,460
by taking advantage of my concern for you?

459
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,940
You used me as bait to defeat them.
I was cooperating with you.

460
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,860
How can that be?

461
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,660
I was really worried about you.

462
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,100
Are you worried about me?

463
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,380
Of course!

464
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,340
You got injured to help me.

465
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,980
If anything happens to you,

466
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm afraid I can't afford
to pay the medical expenses.

467
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,660
The pink team is out!
The green team is the winner!

468
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,300
I didn't expect

469
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,860
Mr. Xia is also good at Paintball.

470
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,660
If I had known it earlier,

471
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,460
I wouldn't have traded the sticks with Xing Yun.

472
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,380
You can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

473
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,220
Without going through Mr. Xia's torture,

474
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,060
she couldn't have got paid leave

475
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
and a big bonus.

476
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,220
Do you like this?

477
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,020
I'm wondering if I should buy it
as a gift for Chu Nan.

478
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,660
Why not?

479
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,460
Good idea.

480
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,020
It's dry in the office.

481
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,940
By putting the humidifier on the desk,

482
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,820
he can feel the love of his girlfriend anytime.

483
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,300
Please pack it up for me.

484
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,500
The view here is great.

485
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,020
Have you ever been to Xiangu Temple?

486
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,620
The view there is gorgeous!

487
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,820
Xiangu Temple?

488
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,220
That's right.

489
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,340
Besides the beautiful view,

490
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,660
it's also famous for
making people's wishes come true.

491
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,060
You'll get whatever you like
as long as you make a vow there.

492
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,100
Exactly.

493
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,500
I've been there before.

494
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,140
Lots of people have sent a silk banner
to show their gratitude.

495
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,940
How far is it from here?

496
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,660
It's not far. You'll  be able to
arrive there in 30 minutes on foot.

497
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,820
In 30 minutes?

498
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,620
Xing Yun, let's go have a look.

499
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,300
Okay.

500
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,020
No problem.

501
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,020
How much is it?

502
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,620
Let me find the route.

503
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,940
(A woman first in love jumped from height
to get back together with her ex)

504
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,100
I can't believe it.

505
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,820
Look.

506
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,300
A 27-year-old woman was crossed in love
for the first time.

507
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,740
She jumped from height
to get back together with her ex.

508
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,820
It's ridiculous.

509
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,100
It's just a man. It's not worth it.

510
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,860
Exactly.

511
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,300
In my opinion,

512
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,780
a woman should have her own life.

513
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,500
Men will be attracted
if she has confidence in herself.

514
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,940
You wouldn't say that

515
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,180
if it were your first love, right?

516
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,700
Mengmeng, did you break your heart

517
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,660
when you were crossed in love
for the first time?

518
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,340
Well.

519
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,340
I totally forgot about it.

520
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,380
As far as I'm concerned,

521
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,260
the later a woman gets into a relationship,

522
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,540
the harder it'll be for her to get it over
if she's disappointed in love.

523
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,420
Just think about it.

524
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,940
When a woman with no relationship experience

525
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,700
meets a man

526
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,460
who's experienced in relationships,

527
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,020
she's bound to get hurt easily

528
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,180
and may never move on.

529
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,740
It's reasonable, right? Remember it well.

530
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,660
Planning schemes adopted. Popular games.
More bonuses.

531
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,660
What do you think of it?

532
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,980
Just so so.

533
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,860
All these things can be achieved

534
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,380
if you work hard.

535
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,500
Now that you're in a temple,

536
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,580
you have to pray for something

537
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,420
that depends on destiny.

538
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,500
What is it?

539
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,780
Of course love.

540
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,940
For example, spending your whole life with Chu Nan.

541
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,740
Oh.

542
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,580
I even don't know how it is going with him.

543
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,740
I hope things have settled down.

544
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,620
Hasn't he called you?

545
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,300
Maybe he's too busy.

546
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,860
He didn't answer the phone or send me a message.

547
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,740
Is it possible something has happened to him?

548
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,460
I hope not.

549
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,340
He left with Shen Qing, right?

550
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,980
Just ask Mr. Xia

551
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,500
if Shen Qing has arrived when you see him.

552
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,060
Okay.

553
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,700
Can I have one more piece?

554
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,620
Rewrite it.

555
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,580
Hurry up.

556
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,420
Look at it.

557
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,980
I hope everything goes smoothly
in my relationship with Chu Nan

558
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,700
and all is well with his family.

559
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,580
You can pray for pregnancy.

560
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,940
Yiyi, how many babies do you want to have?

561
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,900
A boy or a girl?

562
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,460
Can you reach it? Let me help you.

563
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,620
Now that Mr. Xia said so,

564
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,100
just accept his offer.

565
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,420
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

566
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,380
It'll let Xing Yun and Chu Nan

567
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,660
have an everlasting relationship.

568
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,460
What are you doing?

569
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,420
Do you know what time it is?

570
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,500
We're half an hour late.

571
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,540
We should have gathered half an hour ago.

572
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,820
Xing Yun, let's go.

573
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,980
Excuse me, Mr. Xia.

574
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,860
Mr. Xia, see you around.

575
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,140
Mr. Xia, did your sister call you?

576
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,260
Did she go back safely?

577
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,020
Yes.

578
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,340
How about Chu Nan?

579
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,780
Where did he get off?

580
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,020
He's not contactable.

581
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,020
He left when my sister got off at the hospital.

582
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,220
A 27-year-old woman was crossed in love
for the first time.

583
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,700
She jumped from height
to get back together with her ex.

584
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,780
It's ridiculous.

585
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,940
It's just a man. It's not worth it.

586
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,860
Oh. What's the biggest setback

587
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
you've faced since your childhood?

588
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,940
Setback?

589
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,980
Everything has been going well.

590
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,340
I live in a happy family. My parents love me.

591
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,180
I don't need to worry about food or clothing.

592
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,020
Why are you asking about it?

593
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,220
Well.

594
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,660
I'm just wondering

595
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,460
if you'll never recover from a setback

596
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,260
now that everything has been going smoothly.

597
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Impossible.

598
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,940
I haven't gone through many storms of life,

599
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,220
but I'm good at

600
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,420
rising strong from failure and disappointment.

601
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,260
Why?

602
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,820
Have you ever been trained by your parents?

603
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,900
Because my boss is nobody else but you.

604
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,500
Xing Yun!

605
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,820
Just kidding.

606
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,460
Actually, a setback is just like a steamed stuffed bun.

607
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,660
You're not full

608
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,940
until you begin to eat the seventh one,

609
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,780
but you can't regret eating the previous six ones.

610
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,980
Without them,

611
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,540
the seventh will become the first.

612
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,500
You'll have to eat six more to be full.

613
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,300
Without an accumulation of setbacks,

614
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,380
man will never succeed.

615
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
You've learned all the major principles

616
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,620
from eating, right?

617
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,860
However, I've heard

618
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,540
depression is something
that can't be controlled by us.

619
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,580
If I suffer from depression someday,

620
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,340
those philosophic thoughts will be of no use.

621
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,500
So,

622
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
be nicer to me later.

623
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,460
I can't tell her.

624
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,780
As far as I'm concerned,

625
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,620
the later a woman gets into a relationship,

626
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,980
the harder it'll be for her to get it over
if she's disappointed in love.

627
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,060
Okay. It's done.

628
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,260
Xiaoxi, you're brave.

629
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,900
You didn't cry at all.

630
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,340
Thank you, Big Sister. Thank you, Grandma.

631
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,780
I'm not your grandma.

632
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,100
I can't call you aunt, right?

633
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,380
You're right. You didn't do anything wrong.

634
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,900
Where is your mom?

635
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,020
She's gone to work.

636
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,380
She'll be back in two hours.

637
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,300
Xiaoxi, where is your dad?

638
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,340
Mom said

639
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,460
my dad will be back

640
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,460
when I become an excellent man.

641
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,500
Xiaoxi, you're already

642
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,100
an excellent boy.

643
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,860
But I know

644
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,620
he's abandoned my mom and me.

645
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,580
Don't say that.

646
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,860
No one would

647
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,140
abandon such a cute kid like you.

648
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,900
It doesn't matter
even if he'll never be back.

649
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,820
I'll take care of my mom.

650
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,340
Xiaoxi, what does your dad do?

651
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,940
I've never seen him.

652
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,100
Life is not easy for Miss Shen.

653
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,460
She has to take care of a kid and work.

654
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,100
And Xiaoxi is so sensible and thoughtful.

655
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,980
I really didn't expect it.

656
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,140
Just stay here.

657
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,980
Let the nurse know if it hurts.

658
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,140
I hope I can get better soon.

659
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,180
Then my mom wouldn't need to worry about me.

660
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,780
He's sensible.

661
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,380
-Hello. -Hello.

662
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,980
Xing Yun, is Chu Nan still not contactable?

663
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,140
Then focus on the planning scheme.

664
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,940
There will be a discussion
at the end of the month.

665
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,780
Based on my experience,

666
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,020
the Arts Unit and programmers

667
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,140
will all make things difficult for you.

668
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,420
Besides, you're a green hand in it.

669
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,460
I tried to ask programmers for advice,

670
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,140
but they always made excuses
and avoided seeing me.

671
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,660
They're difficult to deal with.

672
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,420
Just like male chauvinist pigs
are the biggest opponents of

673
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,340
otome games.

674
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,700
There were some things they could have done,

675
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,260
but they made the rating higher on purpose

676
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,060
to get more resources.

677
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,100
That's what I'm worried about.

678
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,620
I haven't seen Mr. Xia
since the day after the teambuilding.

679
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,100
You can ask Dongdong about it.

680
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,140
He's experienced.

681
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,740
A programmer had told him

682
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,860
it would take three weeks
to finish one of the cases,

683
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,580
but finally, he made it happen within 12 days.

684
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,900
Really? Is he so awesome?

685
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,740
That game is no fun at all.

686
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,100
I want to give up within five minutes.

687
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,620
I think it's not bad.

688
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,980
You know nothing about it.

689
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,420
Wow.

690
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,660
What do you mean?

691
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,860
I got it for you on purpose.

692
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,540
It's from your favorite bakery at the corner.

693
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,020
It's delicious!

694
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,980
Why are you still here?

695
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,660
I've heard you're good at
dealing with programmers.

696
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,220
Can you give me some advice?

697
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,580
I'm busy.

698
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,060
Take it away.

699
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,740
Hold on.

700
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,740
Put it down.

701
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,540
You have to give me more details

702
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,140
if you want me to help you.

703
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,540
I'll know how they'll make difficulties for you

704
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,260
after I look through the document.

705
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,060
Got it.

706
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,420
Do you really want to help her?

707
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,380
What's wrong? Can't I be a good man?

708
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,460
I see.

709
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,780
I'm confused.

710
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,500
Who on earth is your girlfriend?

711
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,300
Xing Yun is my girlfriend

712
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,740
and I'll propose to her soon.

713
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,340
Shen Qing is just one of my friends.

714
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,620
Her son is injured,

715
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,140
so I'm here to see him.

716
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,020
Friends?

717
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,940
Do you think I'll believe it?

718
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,700
Do you believe it?

719
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,460
It doesn't matter if you believe it or not.

720
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,540
Chu Nan, I hope you think carefully

721
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,460
before you say anything.

722
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,420
I won't let you hurt my sister

723
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,420
or Xing Yun.

724
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,500
Hello?

725
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,060
Xia Ke, when will you be here?

726
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,260
Something seems to be going wrong with Xiaoxi.
