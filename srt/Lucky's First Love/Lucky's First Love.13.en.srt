00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,480
（Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

4
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,780
Mr. Xia, I'm really so sorry.

5
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,120
We really cannot deny responsibility

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,610
for what has happened,

7
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,240
but I came back as soon as it did.

8
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,400
Please, sit.

9
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,910
Director Qian, I want to know who is responsible

10
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,030
for this event?

11
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,730
It was me, Mr. Xia.

12
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,900
You're still laughing! You should be apologizing.

13
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,400
Mr. Xia, I am really sorry.

14
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,610
Although He Yu is your good friend,

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,290
his attitude

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,230
towards work

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,640
is really bad.

18
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,890
Mr. Xia, because this is an emergency,

19
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,840
I haven't had time to confirm the new information,

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,040
but I don't believe that this is a mistake.

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
Because I think

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
that clients are much more lively in the evenings

23
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,690
than they are during the day.

24
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,850
So I changed the time without consulting anyone.

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,950
Come on, He Yu.

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
Don't go looking for excuses, OK?

27
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,290
We all know

28
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,580
that the evenings are not the best time
for online events.

29
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,110
Right?

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,500
What if something goes wrong?

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,830
It's bound to end up a disaster.

32
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,890
How could you deliberately change the time?

33
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,520
That's exactly what I did.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,600
And I also especially arranged

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,170
for Yao Qing and some other staff

36
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,600
to be on call at the company.

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Director Qian, reporting.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,270
The technical online problem

39
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,790
was resolved five minutes ago.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,000
Th-Th-Then the inventory?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,820
What about the inventory?

42
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
Do you know that because of this mistake,

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,250
1,000 pieces have become 100,000.

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,230
Are you aware of that?

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,980
The more Mr. Xia sells, the more he's lost.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
We should clear something up.

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,330
This was not a mistake.

48
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,920
Mr. He believed that

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
1,000 pieces for our loyal players

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,770
was just way too little

51
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,680
and that it would influence
the effectiveness of the event.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,300
So we changed the system settings

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,690
so that over 1,000 pieces now cost

54
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,370
88 yuan.

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,610
Those who hadn't managed to get them,
were willing to pay that much.

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,050
Right.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,750
One minute before the promotion ended,

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,240
we had already sold

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,800
up to 80,000 pieces worth of game cards.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Which was higher than the expected publicity
was thought to achieve.

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,540
Therefore, Mr. Xia has not lost money,

62
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,760
he has made a lot.

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,200
I knew I had an eye for talent.

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,910
Director Qian, no matter if it is manmade or a mistake,

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,660
your staff's ability to adjust to situations here

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,150
is something I appreciate very much.

67
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,150
Not bad. Not bad.

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,430
They're all under my leadership.

69
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,300
It's nothing.

70
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,180
No need to be polite, Mr. Xia.

71
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,840
It's fine. Congratulations.

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,690
Then I'll take my leave.

73
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,670
Fine, fine.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,560
Take care, Mr. Xia.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,010
Everyone is happy.

76
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,370
You two…

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,160
Are honestly such schemers.

78
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm going, out of the way!

79
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
Mr. Xia, I'll see you out.

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,450
Sorry about this.

81
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,950
This is the only place I know
that's still open at this time.

82
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,660
Not at all.

83
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,120
If we don't have barbecue after work,
it will be a tough working day, won't it?

84
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,520
That felt so good today!

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,040
I really regret that I didn't get a picture

86
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
of Mr. Qian's shriveled face.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,910
I could have posted it in the company's group.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,990
But I think

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,910
you really should thank Yao Qing for this.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,570
Right.

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,820
Yao Qing, you really are my savior.

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,940
Tell me.

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,970
Apart from repaying you with marrying you,

94
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,300
I'll agree to anything.

95
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,500
Alright. Don't get all sentimental.

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I just didn't want the animosity
between you and Director Qian

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
to affect TIG.

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
So let's just accept that you owe me one.

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
How are you going to repay me?

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,440
Eat up. Eat up.

101
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,610
I'm the only one that isn't.

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,490
How did you find out

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,190
that Mr. Qian was up to mischief?

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,080
Right, what exactly was going on?

105
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,360
Aren't you coming to the gathering tonight?

106
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,740
I want to,

107
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,470
but Director Qian told me to stay behind.

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,120
He said that TIG's online backend

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
has an element that needs changing.

110
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,460
I think it might be the online timing.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,920
Why don't you go without me? I'll come later.

112
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,020
(At 8PM on 14th October
Stocks:10,000)

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,410
They've really changed the time.

114
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,740
Miss Yao, look.

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,330
The online time has been changed
to eight o'clock in the evening.

116
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,960
And the inventory has changed to 100,000.

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
Should I change it back?

118
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,700
No.

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,800
Wang, do me a favor

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,350
and stay behind tonight

121
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,360
until after the game has gone online.

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
If anything goes wrong,
we'll be able to deal with it.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,670
No wonder the system was restored so quickly

124
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,010
after going down.

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,860
We countered his plotting.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,800
Not only did we expand TIG's influence,

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,980
and that's all thanks to me.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,760
Miss Yao,

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,160
you're not as simple a role as you might appear.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,410
Mr. Qian was done for when he ran into you.

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,370
But I hope that once this cooperation is over,

132
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,370
nothing like this will ever happen again.

133
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,400
Don't worry. You've got me here.

134
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,590
But from the feedback on this online promotion,

135
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
everyone's expectation for the Instance Zones

136
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,770
was really high.

137
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Right. I hope we don't let everyone down.

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
- We won't. 
- No way.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,530
OK. OK. OK.

140
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Come, a toast to our Instance Zones' success.

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,880
Cheers.

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,840
Cheers.

143
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,440
Cheers.

144
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Cheers.

145
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,260
Shen Qing, just now we received a delivery.

146
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,120
They said it was for you.

147
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,040
What a beautiful Calla Lilly!

148
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,310
Who sent it?

149
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,510
(Certificate of Apartment ownership)

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,070
Apartment?

151
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,900
Someone has given you an apartment?

152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,970
You finally agreed to come and see me.

153
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,250
This gift is too much.

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,760
All I want is your blessings.

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,970
Sit.

156
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,920
I know about Ling Shan.

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,590
I heard you got remarried.

158
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,260
Your husband is a banker.

159
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
Although he doesn't come from any impressive background,

160
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,160
he is a good man.

161
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,220
You still get so much accurate information.

162
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,400
Shen Qing,

163
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,260
now you know who he really is,

164
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,020
do you still hate me like you used to?

165
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,980
Recently, I've been feeling old.

166
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,490
Your parents passed away young.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,720
I brought up you and your siblings.

168
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,740
I supported the Xia family all on my own.

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,400
Yes, I'm strong and cold,

170
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,300
and I've spent the best part of my life alone.

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,120
I don't want to take your hatred with me into the grave.

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,900
I have never hated you.

173
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,680
I just didn't want to be a pawn in your games.

174
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,410
I know that I've always been a disappointment to you.

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,540
But I have never regretted giving birth to Xiaoxi.

176
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,770
In fact, since I've had him,

177
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,310
I've been able to better understand

178
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,440
why you did what you did back then.

179
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
Shen Qing!

180
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,360
How is Xia Ke?

181
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,470
Is he still on his own?

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,120
He…I guess that he won't be for long.

183
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
Shen Qing.

184
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Welcome. Come in.

185
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,940
In order to save my appetite for your hand-made cakes,

186
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,190
I didn't even have breakfast.

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,800
Where's Xiaoxi?

188
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,400
Chu Nan took him out.

189
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,620
It looks like cake baking really is an art form.

190
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,930
Right.

191
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,100
Why don't I teach you how to bake cakes?

192
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
Me…

193
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,000
Forget it.

194
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,810
Mr. Xia says that I'm clumsy

195
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,010
and nothing like someone who's studied art

196
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,080
This is just another kind of art.

197
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,010
You can make Xia Ke's favorite cake.

198
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,450
Mr. Xia has a favorite cake?

199
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,360
Sure. Black Forest.

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,320
Black Forest is a mountainous area in southwest Germany.

201
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,770
Every time there is a harvest of cherries,

202
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,600
they won't just be made into jam,

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,290
but also appear in a variety of desserts.

204
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
That's where Black Forest Cake comes from.

205
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,620
Mixed in with the pastry

206
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,440
is cherry juice and cherry liquor.

207
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,240
When making the fresh cream,

208
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,340
you must add at least 80 grams of cherry juice.

209
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
The oven should be set to 170 degrees

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,860
and then you just have to patiently wait.

211
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,350
I thought that it was called that

212
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,440
because of

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,890
the black chocolate swirls on top.

214
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,710
Most people believe that too.

215
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,600
Actually,

216
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
it's just a sweet dessert that happens
to come from a place with a dark name.

217
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,370
No wonder Mr. Xia likes it.

218
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,620
It's just like him.

219
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,720
Like him?

220
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,130
I can't explain it.

221
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,590
Roughly speaking, they're both very deep and mysterious.

222
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,350
Do you want earrings or a necklace?

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,490
That's a really cruel choice to give a woman.

224
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,050
Then earrings it is.

225
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,010
You can always do with an extra pair.

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
They change them more often.

227
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,020
Tell me, you little briber, what do you want?

228
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,100
No, honestly, Miss Yao.

229
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,450
You're way too cynical.

230
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,060
You helped me out in such a big way,

231
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,660
it's right that I should thank you.

232
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,760
You're overthinking things.

233
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,400
That was just…

234
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,540
OK. OK. I know you weren't helping me.

235
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,480
You were helping TIG.

236
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,700
But with my understanding of Xia Ke,

237
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,230
I bet he hasn't remembered
that tomorrow is your birthday.

238
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,300
So I have no choice,

239
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,320
but to be a good man this time.

240
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,900
Then you'd better not buy anything cheap,

241
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,050
or I'll throw it in your face!

242
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,870
Hear me?!

243
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,700
Strong women aren't just so cute.

244
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,210
Please wrap this up for me.

245
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,250
OK. Hang on.

246
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,520
Can I have a look at that?

247
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,590
This is our latest design.

248
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,820
A four leaf clover represents good luck.

249
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,810
What do you think of Xia Ke?

250
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,940
Mr. Xia is a good man.

251
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
He appears cold, but he's warm deep down
and he's talented.

252
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,780
Even though he has a bad temper sometimes.

253
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,440
I mean,

254
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
if you forget he's your boss,

255
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,380
what do you think of him?

256
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,860
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

257
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm curious.

258
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,620
I don't know.

259
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,800
He talks little, but is loaded.

260
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,000
Thinking about it now,

261
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,810
that cute little boy back then,

262
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,790
actually grew up to be this dark-faced iceberg.

263
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,620
Mr. Xia used to be cute?

264
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,960
I really can't imagine

265
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
what that must have been like.

266
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,730
When he was a kid,

267
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,330
he wasn't just cute, but he loved to show off.

268
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,060
Even when he was terrified,

269
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,880
he would force himself
to look like he could protect me.

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,200
Mr. Xia is afraid of something?

271
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,250
Of course.

272
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,520
I'll tell you one of his weak points.

273
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,520
What are you up to, laughing away like that?

274
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,200
Mr., Mr. Xia?

275
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,950
Really, wherever there's food,

276
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,960
there's you.

277
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,450
Are you here to try some as well?

278
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,190
Do you mind?

279
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,290
No. Of course not.

280
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,450
Perfect timing, the cake should be ready.

281
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,780
Xing Yun made this herself.

282
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,740
You have to have a try.

283
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,480
Not really, I was just having a bit of fun.

284
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,640
Try doing one yourself.

285
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,720
Take it slowly.

286
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,300
I'll go and take a look.

287
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,220
When will you come and collect it?

288
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,190
I will contact you later.

289
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,560
Is the vet here?

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,480
Yes.

291
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,710
What's wrong with it?

292
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,310
I just found it in the street.

293
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,390
I think it hurt its right leg.
It keeps crying out.

294
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,210
I'll take a look.

295
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,310
(Xing Yun)

296
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,320
Everything always turns out alright in the end.

297
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,360
If things still aren't going right,

298
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
it just proves that it's not the end yet.

299
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,410
Xing Yun.

300
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,160
You're the one.

301
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,770
I really can't believe

302
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,390
that someone who studied art,

303
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,290
is as clumsy as this.

304
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,880
I…

305
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,920
What are you doing so close to me?

306
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,040
I might be your employee,

307
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,770
but I'm still a woman.

308
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,440
Men and women should keep their distance,
don't you know?

309
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,230
When you were cooking pizza with He Yu,

310
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,720
you didn't seem to be paying any attention to that rule.

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
What's this got to do with him?

312
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,910
Also, we weren't that close.

313
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,710
Forget it, either way it was bound to taste horrible.

314
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,360
Of course. Of course it was.

315
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,780
What was that for?

316
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,470
I just remembered I ordered some fruit from the shop.

317
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,890
Could you get it for me?

318
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,030
Sure.

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,620
He always tries to knock people off their balance.

320
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,620
It's as if he has nothing better
to do than wind people up.

321
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,820
He has such an evil sense of humor.

322
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,500
You're the clumsy one!

323
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,120
You're eating it even though it's ruined.

324
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,630
It's not bad afterall.

325
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,770
Look at you. If you really like Xing Yun,

326
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,160
you can't keep pretending you don't.

327
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,530
You know that rich and handsome guys

328
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,890
can still come across as complete jerks?

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,960
Forget it, it's not like you'll admit.

330
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,150
Then what should I do?

331
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,800
What did you just say?

332
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,180
I'm going.

333
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,830
Don't. Don't.

334
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,900
What are you doing?

335
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,830
You just suddenly admitted your feelings.

336
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm not really used to it.

337
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,670
You admit you like her, right?

338
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,820
I haven't seen you be this honest

339
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,450
for years and years.

340
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,460
Quick, beg me and I'll think of a way to help you.

341
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,950
Lucky charm!

342
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,580
What are you doing here?

343
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,600
Doesn't this just prove
that we are destined to be together?

344
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,870
It looks like that four leaf clover really is lucky.

345
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,160
Come with me, I'll take you somewhere.

346
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,440
No, thanks.

347
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,560
I have a nice present for you.

348
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,150
I'm not a three-year-old child.

349
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
Have you seen movie 12

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,240
of “One Piece Film Z”?

351
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,920
I forgot all about it. It came out the day before yesterday.

352
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,440
It's great.

353
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,620
"Black Arm" Zephyr fights against Borsalino

354
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,720
to try and put a stop to the Great Age of Piracy.

355
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,480
Stop! Stop!

356
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,600
People who give spoilers for movies,
will remain single all their lives.

357
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,710
How do you know about that anime?

358
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,860
Because…

359
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,350
I have a Japanese friend

360
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,110
that opened an anime-themed shop

361
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,120
and they've got loads of
limited edition "One Piece" products.

362
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,830
Like golden limited edition Monkey D. Luffy T-shirts.

363
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,310
I think there are only 100 in the world

364
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,240
and his shop only has two.

365
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm not falling for it.

366
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,820
Apparently this T-shirt

367
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,800
has the author's signature on it.

368
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,560
That must be so expensive!

369
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,720
Friend's prices.

370
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,910
Why don't you go and take a look?

371
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,480
I have to deliver some fruit first.

372
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,440
Then I'll go with you.

373
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
You're really going to have to try harder.

374
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,980
He Yu

375
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,670
is a really likeable guy.

376
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,050
He's not being serious.

377
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
Really?

378
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,170
He doesn't get serious easily.

379
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,910
But you're always deadly serious.

380
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
What plus points do you have?

381
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,480
Either way,

382
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,200
I can come up with five or six merits
for He Yu just like that.

383
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
Funny, interesting, simple, outgoing and passionate.

384
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,510
For girls like Xing Yun

385
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,480
who've come from happy families,

386
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
they're usually pretty sympathetic.

387
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,940
If you really think
that you're cold-blooded, venom-tongued

388
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,330
and have zero merits,

389
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,250
you can always try to appeal
to play the sympathy card.

390
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,240
Are you enjoying yourself?

391
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,020
See, your rival isn't messing around.

392
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,540
He Yu, you're here!

393
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,080
What are the two of you doing together?

394
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,740
Why shouldn't we be together?

395
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,820
Let's go, Xing Yun.

396
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,150
They close at six o'clock.

397
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,720
Where are you going?

398
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
It wouldn't interest you.

399
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,100
It's limited edition merchandise from "One Piece".

400
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,230
We're going to try and get

401
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,560
a limited edition T-shirt.

402
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,950
You seemed to have changed your style.

403
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes, starting from today.

404
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,160
If you really think
that you're cold-blooded, venom-tongued

405
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,790
and have zero merits,

406
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,120
you can always try to appeal to play the sympathy card.

407
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Shen Qing, if there's nothing else,

408
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,370
then I'll be going.

409
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,930
Fine.

410
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,350
You weren't hurt, were you?

411
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm fine.

412
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,910
My clothes just got a bit wet.

413
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,720
Take them to the dry-cleaners

414
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,860
and then drive me back to my house.

415
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,660
You can get one of your 300 servant girls
to do it for you!

416
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,570
Hey!

417
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,560
Xia Ke, is that what you call
playing the sympathy card?

418
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,000
You're so naïve.

419
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,560
Morning!

420
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,420
What did you do to Mr. Xia?

421
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,400
Why?

422
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,800
He brought these here for you
first thing this morning.

423
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,210
As well as a cup of coffee.

424
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,310
What's wrong with the boss?

425
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,720
Has he changed his ways?

426
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,510
He also bought breakfast for his staff.

427
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,450
What is all this, the "last supper"?

428
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Who cares?

429
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,400
Come.

430
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,580
It's a waste not to eat it.

431
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,110
Amy, Amy, do you want some?

432
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,760
Xing Yun, you'll get fat

433
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,800
eating cake for breakfast.

434
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,940
Where are you going?

435
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
I'm going to buy Miss Yao a birthday present.

436
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,300
Really?

437
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,930
The boss has really changed.

438
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,200
Not only did he buy me cake,

439
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,430
but also buys people presents.

440
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,860
In the past, no matter how important the partner was

441
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,190
he'd never bother with birthday presents.

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,900
Miss Yao is different.

443
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,060
She is Mr. Xia's…

444
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,120
Hang on.

445
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,590
Hello, yes.

446
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,030
You're here?

447
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,070
OK. I'll be right down.

448
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,830
Forget it, my car's here.

449
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,320
Mr. Xia's what?

450
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,920
Who knows?

451
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,600
It's good.

452
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,630
Listen to me. Stop sending her on errands.

453
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,930
You have to do exactly the opposite.

454
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,000
(Meeting room)

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,980
Although there may still be a few problems,

456
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,040
the overall promotional direction

457
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,920
is like that.

458
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,390
I am very happy with our partnership with Jiawo

459
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,010
this time around.

460
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
I hope everything will go smoothly in the future.

461
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,680
OK. Then that's the end.

462
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,000
I have to go and find Xing Yun,

463
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,480
I have a gift for her.

464
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,320
A four leaf clover necklace.

465
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,410
I want to tie down my little lucky charm.

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
I remember that in TIG

467
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,990
giving presents over 500 yuan

468
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,140
is considered bribery.

469
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,290
Major discrepancies lead to direct dismissal.

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,220
You really are all over mean.

471
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,000
If you really want to give her a gift,

472
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,930
you can wait until our partnership has expired.

473
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,360
Around November next year.

474
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,570
No problem.

475
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,980
Me and lucky charm

476
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,020
don't have a simple relationship

477
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,750
that revolves around money and material goods.

478
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,610
Then I'll just go and chat with her about "One Piece".

479
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,580
Is there anything else?

480
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,480
Are you free this evening?

481
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,520
It's your birthday,

482
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,030
shouldn't you be going out tonight with friends?

483
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,070
I don't have many birthdays in my 20s left.

484
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,120
I want to spend it with people that matter most.

485
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,680
But I'm busy tonight.

486
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,280
I will wait for you!

487
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,590
You'll never get Patrick Star.

488
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,030
Never get Patrick Star.

489
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,590
Never get.

490
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,440
Hello. Playing prize claw?

491
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,720
Mr. He, you've finished the meeting?

492
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,320
Yiyi, here's a present for you.

493
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,350
For me?

494
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,400
I can't, Mr. He.

495
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,120
That really isn't appropriate,
I, I, I can't accept that.

496
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,170
Inappropriate.

497
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,360
Right. Inappropriate.

498
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,370
The, then forget it.

499
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,760
Then I'll give it to Xing Yun instead.

500
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
It's just secondhand.

501
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
It's not worth anything.

502
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,590
And it isn't going against your company's

503
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,640
bribery policy.

504
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,560
I almost had one!

505
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,170
What are you doing?

506
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,650
Let me remind you, that is expensive.

507
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,090
What would I want this for? I don't want it.

508
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,470
Don't. I bought that especially for you.

509
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,950
You have to accept it.

510
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,480
I don't want it. Take it back.

511
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,130
No.

512
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,160
I don't want it. I don't!

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,230
I, I…

514
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,880
I won't interrupt you.

515
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
You're leaving, Mr. He?

516
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,500
Bye.

517
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,760
Don't lose it.

518
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,040
You're the one that shouldn't lose it.

519
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,140
Take care, Mr. He. I won't see you out.

520
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,530
Mr. He really is like a warm winter's day.

521
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,770
Why don't you give him a chance?

522
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,550
Him?

523
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,480
I mean, what do you

524
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,210
dislike about him?

525
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,260
Nothing.

526
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,650
Then why not be together?

527
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,600
Not disliking doesn't mean I like him.

528
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,750
Miss Yao,

529
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
what are you doing here on your own?

530
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,900
Mr. Xia said

531
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,450
you were celebrating with some friends here.

532
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,840
And asked me to bring you this gift.

533
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,520
Thank you.

534
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,910
Xia Ke, he…?

535
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,750
He's a bit busy.

536
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,270
That's all. Happy birthday.

537
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,280
I'd better be going.

538
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,860
Thanks, bye.

539
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,260
(To Xia Ke: I will wait for you.)

540
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,760
(Yao Qing: I will wait for you.)

541
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,700
Hello, Miss.

542
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you going to order?

543
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Our chefs will be finishing work soon.

544
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,700
Sure. -OK.

545
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
The bill, please.

546
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,920
Sorry for making you all finish work late.

547
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,710
Not at all.

548
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,190
I just heard that it's your birthday today.

549
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,170
Actually, it's my birthday today too.

550
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,340
It must be fate.

551
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,280
Happy birthday.

552
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,520
Happy birthday.

553
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,860
This is for you.

554
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,910
I cannot accept that.

555
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,240
Just take it, happy birthday.

556
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,040
You don't need that much.

557
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,960
Understand?

558
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,450
I saw that

559
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,880
she was using this much today.

560
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,450
Look, this isn't the slightest bit round.

561
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,750
(Classmates' Group:We should get together some day)

562
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,450
Class reunion.

563
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,360
Class reunion. High school or university?

564
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,420
University.

565
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,610
Then, then will that Lin Jing be back?

566
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,560
Didn't she go to the US to study?

567
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,290
I don't know.

568
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,640
Forget it, the Instance Zones is going online.

569
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,970
And there are lots of testing problems.

570
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,420
I could get called back to the office at any time.

571
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,860
I can't make it.

572
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,350
I'm pretty busy with work recently.

573
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,430
Wish you all have a good time.

574
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,990
Hello,

575
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,750
Lin Jing?

576
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,570
It's so noisy in there.

577
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,790
I can't even hear myself talk.

578
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,330
Oh, by the way, on the phone you said

579
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,520
that there was something important you wanted
to talk to me about face to face.

580
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,360
What is it?

581
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,120
I heard that you're a big planner at TIG.

582
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,320
No, I'm just a small Instance Zones planner.

583
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,250
Then would the key employee

584
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,150
at your famous gaming company,

585
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,050
be willing to help a friend out

586
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,990
and design a wedding invitation?

587
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,400
You're getting married?

588
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
When?

589
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,320
It's three months from now.

590
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,920
You have to come.

591
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,390
Of course. I'll definitely be there.

592
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,040
I'll make sure that your wedding invitation

593
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,980
is a unique and unprecedented design!

594
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,490
Come, while there's no one else in the background,

595
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,610
let's take a selfie.

596
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,930
Oh , right, I heard

597
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,640
that Wang Nan

598
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,070
went out of his way to ask if you'd be coming.

599
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,380
We barely even spoke

600
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,980
when we were at uni together.

601
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,940
I've already asked around for you

602
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,080
and he's a purchasing manager

603
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,530
for a Fortune 500 company.

604
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,090
Although apparently he hasn't made loads of money,

605
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,580
he's got a car,

606
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,130
and although he still rents,

607
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,440
he's still a good catch.

608
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,200
I mean, when did you run out of there?

609
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,170
What are you doing?

610
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,220
We were just talking about you

611
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,480
and here you are.

612
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Were you asking around today
to find out Xing Yun was coming?

613
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,750
It was nothing. It's just been so long and I missed you.

614
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,690
They've almost finished.

615
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,080
Why don't we go next-door for a coffee

616
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,120
and have a chat?

617
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,620
What have you got to chat about with the two of us?

618
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,550
It's just a cup of coffee.

619
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,840
I always get tired when it gets to this time.

620
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,520
Let's go.

621
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,550
The adverts entrance channels are very important.

622
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,880
Understood.

623
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,190
Mr. He, don't worry.

624
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,490
We attach a lot of importance to the TIG project.

625
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,710
I mean, Wang Nan,

626
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,170
you're a successful man now.

627
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,440
Not really.

628
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,220
But I should be able to support a wife.

629
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,750
Right, Xing Yun,

630
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,060
how much do you spend on your clothes every month?

631
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,790
I don't keep count. I don't buy a lot of clothes.

632
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,260
Most women must spend

633
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,920
at least 3,000-5,000 on clothing and makeup.

634
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,280
I can't stand women like that.

635
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,010
I think simple women who don't wear makeup

636
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,040
like Xing Yun are best.

637
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
I put on makeup today.

638
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,110
I'll come straight to the point.

639
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,880
Xing Yun, I specifically came here to see you today.

640
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,760
I want to suggest

641
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,920
that we develop a relationship
with the premise of marriage.

642
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,810
I saw a video a while ago

643
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,900
that really taught me a lesson.

644
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,280
It worked out

645
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,100
that the costs of getting married which is 40,000

646
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,930
spread over the next 60 years

647
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,240
of living together

648
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,100
are only just over one yuan a day.

649
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,390
And if there's any problems at home,

650
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,880
you always have someone to help you out.

651
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,390
Don't worry.

652
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,720
I'm not that stingy.

653
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,200
I will give you 400,000 yuan
as a betrothal gift and for the wedding.

654
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,870
Is this one of those perfect moments from soap operas

655
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,040
where he gets a drink in the face?

656
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,050
Well, Wang Nan is pretty generous.

657
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,240
I'm only planning on spending 100,000 on my wedding.

658
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,120
No, I mean, why would you come to me?

659
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,610
Women these days don't want
to take on any responsibilities.

660
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,870
They think that men should serve them.

661
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,860
Actually, I just want to find an ordinary woman,

662
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,880
from an ordinary background and with ordinary looks.

663
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,580
And doesn't mind living an ordinary life
with no desires.

664
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,650
That's what I was thinking.

665
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,160
What kind of woman can put up with
not eating, drinking or having clothes,

666
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,990
and devoting their life to washing your clothes, giving birth,

667
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,960
and looking after your parents?

668
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,120
Who are you?

669
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,660
If that's what you think,

670
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,580
then you're wrong.

671
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,850
My lucky charm, is not the type of woman
you think she is.

672
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
He Yu?

673
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,220
I try to get you to like me and you ignore me.

674
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,720
You're going to spend your life with a guy like him?

675
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,540
Mr. He, where's that necklace you gave me?

676
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,540
I thought it was too cheap, so I didn't accept it.

677
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,290
It's in your pocket, right?

678
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,270
I know that brand.

679
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,470
That cost over 10,000, right?

680
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,820
20,000.

681
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,950
Give it here. It suddenly doesn't seem so bad.

682
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,640
I'll put it on for you.

683
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,680
Lin Jing, it looks like we'll have to continue
our discussions later over the phone.

684
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,460
Then let's go to dinner.

685
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,390
Sure.

686
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,650
But you know

687
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,400
that I won't eat anywhere
that's less than 500 per head.

688
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,500
Of course.

689
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,620
The man I want to marry

690
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,920
must have a 200-square-meter apartment
in the center of the city

691
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,350
and without a mortgage.

692
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,600
A car that cost over 1,000,000.

693
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,940
And eat and use the best there is to eat and use.

694
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,820
If you add it up like that,

695
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,110
you'll probably have to work your ass off
for the next few decades.

696
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,640
And if the two of us really married,

697
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,580
a dozen yuan won't be anywhere enough 
to support me each day.

698
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,600
You're up to the standards
but she just doesn't want to marry you.

699
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
What to do?

700
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,880
In the future, I'll come to you for advice

701
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,850
on how you managed to get my dream girl out on a date.

702
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,130
Let's go.

703
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,280
I didn't see that coming.

704
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,980
Xing Yun really is something special.

705
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,340
Now you understand how hard it is
finding a good man, right?

706
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,050
He didn't even count as a human, alright?

707
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,800
Right.

708
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,620
What kind of creature could mistake you for ordinary?

709
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,930
In my eyes you can shine.

710
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,520
Are you finished?

711
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,080
Are the conditions for marriage
you just mentioned

712
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,980
still for real?

713
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,040
I have an apartment in the center of the city.

714
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,220
It's only 20 meters off your standard.

715
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,630
Are you never going to let this act drop?

716
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,940
Then at least you could thank me

717
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,450
for helping you getting that off your chest.

718
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,190
I left my client in the café for you.

719
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,310
I got in the way of your work.

720
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,430
Of my dinner.

721
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,240
By the way,

722
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,800
I'd better remind you

723
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,870
that I don't eat anywhere under 500 yuan per head.

724
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,960
I know a really good restaurant.

725
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,760
Let's go.

726
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,260
(Dessert: 120 yuan; Fillet Steak: 530 yuan)

727
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,210
Mr. He, you have such a good figure,

728
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,120
you must not eat much.

729
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,380
If I order a steak, one will be enough.

730
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,360
But I'd need five dishes of this pasta.

731
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,030
Then go for the steak.

732
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,600
You're so generous today.

733
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,100
It'll be quicker that way.

734
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,820
Waiter, we'd like to order.

735
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Enjoy your meal.

736
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,440
Do you still remember

737
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,450
the first time

738
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,480
we met?

739
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,600
Didn't we say we wouldn't mention the karaoke bar again?

740
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,570
In the public security bureau.

741
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,560
That was the first time.

742
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,030
I was really puzzled.

743
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,240
I mean, what kind of woman

744
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,880
would cause Xia Ke to come out
in the middle of night to ask me for help?

745
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,290
What? What help?

746
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,270
I was playing golf then.

747
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,040
But he got me there with a phone call.

748
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,680
Wait up.

749
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
You mean,

750
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,510
that that discussion on the game promotion

751
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,800
was fake; all an act?!

752
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,750
No, no. It was a white lie.

753
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,670
That was Shen Qing's matter.

754
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,520
He didn't know you were in trouble.

755
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,070
No.

756
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,820
He saw me all miserable in the public security bureau

757
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,700
with his own eyes,

758
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,730
and even saw the monitor that I was dragged away.

759
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,380
He saw me dragging my injured leg

760
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,630
and had me going to work every day

761
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,890
and has hidden it from me until now.

762
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,820
An he's never even said

763
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,680
sorry once.

764
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,850
He is your president, after all.

765
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,940
He also didn't know that would happen…

766
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,910
He couldn't have apologized

767
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,090
to a small underling.

768
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,610
It wouldn't be appropriate, would it?

769
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,520
He knew everything and pretends
to be all high and mighty

770
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,910
while he watches others idiotically dash around.

771
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,950
Is it that much fun?

772
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,880
He has an evil sense of humor.
He's sick in the head.

773
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,300
That, that's too much.

774
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,670
Can you really drink that much?

775
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,640
He's the same with Shen Qing.

776
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,180
He's the best in the world.

777
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,410
He's a pinnacle of light.

778
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,480
He's just a candle that anyone could blow out.

779
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,560
It's like he's playing chess every day.

780
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,520
He treats everyone

781
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,200
as if they're his enslaved pawns.

782
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,040
Apart from being part of his tactical setup,

783
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,620
we're absolutely nothing to him.

784
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,230
I mean, he can do anything,

785
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,020
but he can't even learn even the slightest,

786
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
just the slightest ounce of trust.

787
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,310
Do you know how difficult it was
getting rid of all those women

788
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,410
that came knocking in the past?

789
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,600
Do you know how many times

790
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,740
I have fixed his car in the wind

791
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,630
snow, blistering heat and rain?

792
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,770
And he says I'm just an ordinary employee.

793
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
Doesn't it hurt his conscience?

794
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,070
I'm so mad!

795
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,000
Furious!

796
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,650
You'll have to teach me
how to play football in the future.

797
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,780
Don't worry, just stick with me.

798
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,200
You can't just play on your own.

799
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,940
I don't. I take you every day.

800
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
Come, let's go.

801
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,290
It's only over there.

802
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,840
You, you go first. I need to make a call.

803
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Then hurry up.

804
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,360
How is it?

805
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,240
Good.

806
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
What, now?

807
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,320
Where?

808
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,420
If he wasn't handsome and talented,

809
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,680
I don't believe he'd have any friends.

810
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,770
A joke.

811
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,600
I've always thought that alcohol,

812
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,440
especially red wine, is bitter and sour.

813
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,260
But the wine today,

814
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,550
seems to have a fruity sweetness.

815
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,880
What is it?

816
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,480
It's good.

817
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,600
Am I drunk?

818
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,160
Drunk people never

819
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,630
admit to being drunk.

820
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,850
Really?

821
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,640
I want to go to the toilet.

822
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,810
Can you make it?

823
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,280
You think I'm useless too?

824
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,160
You actually think I'm useless too!

825
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,410
No. I don't.

826
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,510
(Reply at once)

827
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,100
It's such a posh restaurant.

828
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,750
How can a woman get that drunk in here?

829
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,010
It's disgraceful.

830
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,680
Where?

831
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,970
What where?

832
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,180
The woman you were just talking about.

833
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,200
The toilet.

834
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,230
OK. Thanks.

835
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,140
I always wanted a little sister.

836
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,380
I'll braid you a plait.

837
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
What are you doing here?

838
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,080
Look at how drunk you are.

839
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,120
I was worried about you.

840
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,160
No one is going to do anything to you.

841
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,070
You actually dare show up in front of me?

842
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:00,260
You look like you've had a sackful to drink.

843
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,640
Apologize to me.

844
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,560
Do you know what you're doing?

845
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm being angry.

846
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,230
Do you know that because of your little games

847
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,960
a young, a young girl in the height of her youth like me,

848
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,420
almost got kidnapped.

849
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,280
I really didn't…

850
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,130
Mr. Xia.

851
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,740
You're in my hands today.

852
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,510
You're always acting so high and mighty

853
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,600
and treating me like a monkey, aren't you?

854
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,030
You really are drunk.

855
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,230
Stand properly.

856
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,390
What are you doing?

857
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,520
Can't you tell?

858
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,840
Punishing you.

859
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,560
Don't push me.

860
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,270
I want a bow.

861
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,670
You don't even have laces,

862
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,090
what do you want a bow for?

863
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,200
You're drunk, I'll take you home.

864
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,450
Off!

865
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,920
You reckon I have no way of dealing with you, right?

866
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,130
Are you worried that others
will discover your weaknesses?

867
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,830
What nonsense is this now?

868
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm going to tell the whole world

869
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,860
what your weaknesses are.

870
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,670
Let me see.

871
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,220
What are you doing?

872
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:17,960
Let me see.

873
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,680
What are you doing?

874
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,560
Liar.

875
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,840
Mr. Xia is afraid of something?

876
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,950
Xia Ke has

877
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,730
a turtle-shaped birthmark on his back.

878
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,620
Liar. Where's the turtle-shaped birthmark?

879
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,720
Are you insane?

880
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,900
What exactly are you trying to do?

881
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,510
Sorry.

882
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,080
You're drunk.

883
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,320
I'll take you home.

884
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,560
Mwah!

885
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,720
I think you've broken the rules, Xia Ke.

886
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,480
Where are you going?

887
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,440
He Yu.

888
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,400
I'll take you home.

889
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,400
Give me a kiss.

890
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,760
Will you?

891
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,010
On my face.

892
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,960
Really?

893
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,840
Yes. And that's not all.

894
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,440
The first kiss between lovers

895
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,730
has a 72% chance of happening at night

896
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,680
and 85% of the time the man makes the first move.

897
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,460
On this beautiful night,

898
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,480
we welcome everyone to share with us

899
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,200
their stories about kisses.
