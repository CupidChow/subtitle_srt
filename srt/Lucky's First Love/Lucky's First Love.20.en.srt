00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,550
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

4
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,910
That's all for

5
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,510
our marketing conference.

6
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,800
All departments carry out the tasks

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,030
we have just assigned to you.

8
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,390
Are there any questions?

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,470
No.

10
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,630
That's all for today.

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
Let me finish this time.

12
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,830
I have figured it out.

13
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
We work together 8 hours a day,

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,750
40 hours a week

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,240
and 2,080 hours a year.

16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,030
Suppose you retire at the age of 55,

17
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,670
that's 52,000 hours.

18
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,670
After rounding off, it is a lifetime.

19
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,830
We'll love each other all our lives.

20
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,110
Do you want to date me

21
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,030
or marry me first?

22
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,520
Both are okay for me.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,160
In a word, I decided that

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,110
I should be responsible for you.

25
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,880
Eat more food to enrich the brain.

26
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,270
Why? I'm not hungry.

27
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,110
I know you're not hungry.

28
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,910
But I think your brain

29
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,240
now needs it very much.

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,910
Would you please stop talking nonsense?

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,600
Is there anything wrong with what I said?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,630
Yes, everything is wrong.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,630
You suddenly said
you should be responsible for me.

34
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,600
It is scary, OK?

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,470
Are you terminally ill?

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,360
No, Yao Qing...

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,190
Anyway,

38
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,880
I don't want to listen to these words anymore.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,910
Sorry, I forgot my cell phone.

40
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,210
(Happy 2nd anniversary of TIG.
Infinite Unknown Love)

41
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,550
Three, two, one.

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:29,200
Happy birthday to TIG.

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,320
Mr. Xia, today is the second anniversary
of TIG's founding.

44
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,200
The first thing you did every time
you came to the company in the past two years

45
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,720
was to open the game.

46
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,550
We are sure you will come back.

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,950
I hope you like the surprise
we have prepared for you.

48
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,320
Mr. Xia, here.

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,880
Thank you all.

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,790
It's not the time to celebrate now,

51
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,390
but I'd like to open this bottle of champagne

52
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,790
for all of you.

53
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,950
Trust is invaluable.

54
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,110
I hope

55
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,040
I will not fail your trust.

56
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,760
Happy birthday to TIG.

57
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,920
TIG.

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,110
Happy birthday.

59
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,440
So you were working on plots
with the script and planning staff

60
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,000
instead of going shopping?

61
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Yes.

62
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,550
Every box which you click on the Ferris wheel

63
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,830
has a memorial event.

64
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,480
It took a lot of time to make it.

65
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,200
We worked everywhere for fear
that you might find out.

66
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,110
How is it? Do you like it?

67
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,070
No.

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,480
Why?

69
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,550
It ruins my character setting.

70
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,320
Actually, you are very touched, aren't you?

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,830
You were afraid that

72
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,000
we all forgot what day it is today,

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,830
so you sneaked back to the company by yourself.

74
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,350
You should

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,830
have long changed your cold face.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,390
In fact,

77
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,200
you don't have to do this for me.

78
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,760
You just have to stay with me all the time.

79
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,640
Xing Yun. Mr. Xia.

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,830
Xing Yun.

81
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,230
Mr. Xia, did you find out that

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
Xing Yun is enlightened
after she came back this time?

83
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,830
That scene she created is really moving.

84
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,160
I think she has made a qualitative leap in EQ

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,790
after she dated Mr. He.

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,830
That's right. Amy, you're drunk.

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
No, I'm not drunk.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,440
I just think Mr. He is very good.

89
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,160
Really. Good love is the mentor of life,

90
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,790
which can radiate the charm of women.

91
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,040
You're charming right now, aren't you?

92
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,320
Enough, Amy.

93
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,550
Let me accompany you to the bathroom

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
to fix your make-up, OK?

95
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,790
Is my make-up messed up?

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,640
Yes, your lipstick is messed up.

97
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,200
Let's go.

98
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,320
Xing Yun, you know your next boyfriend

99
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,070
should thank Mr. He a lot.

100
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,640
Xing Yun, listen,

101
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,070
your next boyfriend should thank Mr. He a lot.

102
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,070
Thank Mr. He a lot.

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Tomorrow you will meet with Mr. Qin, right?

104
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,480
After waiting for so many days,
you'll finally see him.

105
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,040
What kind of person do you think he is?

106
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,550
So you told everyone that

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,790
you and He Yu broke up peacefully, right?

108
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I haven't had time to go into details with them yet.

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
So you're not going to tell others

110
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,830
we're dating, are you?

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,390
I, I think so.

112
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,640
Workplace romances are sensitive.

113
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,110
If I tell Yiyi and Amy about it,

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,440
the whole company will know it.

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
As the common saying goes,

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,230
if the couple always flirt in the public,
they will usually break up soon.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,480
We should keep a low profile,
so we can be together for long.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,270
What's more, who are you?

119
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,040
Would you like your employees

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,270
to talk about your private life
behind your back every day?

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Moreover,

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,320
in case we break up one day...

123
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,110
You even want to break up with me?

124
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,880
No, no. It is just an expression.

125
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,790
I'll give you five seconds.

126
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,470
Delete this idea from your mind.

127
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,370
(He Yu)

128
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,070
(He Yu)

129
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,670
Hello, Lucky.

130
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,790
Help me.

131
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,790
How dare you call her like that?

132
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,200
Xia Ke.

133
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,710
No way, you two are still together so late.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,470
Isn't your progress too fast?

135
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,200
You know it's so late.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,550
You're not allowed to call my girlfriend

137
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
at this late hour.

138
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,550
I...

139
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,790
Enough. Stop it.

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,150
What's up?

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,670
Originally, I wanted to ask you for help,

142
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
but since your boyfriend

143
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,550
cares so much about me calling you at this time,

144
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
I decide to invite you to dinner tomorrow.

145
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,280
Let's have a good chat.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
She is not free.

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
Xing Yun, I really need your help.

148
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,910
Look, before...

149
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,710
Send me the address.

150
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,230
Bye.

151
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,110
You really want to dine with him, don't you?

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,960
He said he had something to ask me for help.

153
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,000
Besides, he did help me before.

154
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,320
What did he do for you?

155
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,200
Pretend to be your boyfriend to piss me off, right?

156
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,710
Mr. Xia, one

157
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,880
more cup of coffee.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
I guess Mr. Qin is always on the way.

159
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,230
He should have been delayed by something.

160
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,590
Sorry.

161
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,760
He should be coming soon.

162
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,350
Amy, you...

163
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,640
No, thanks.

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,760
Hello.

165
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,440
What? He flew away again?

166
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
Where on earth

167
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,470
did Mr. Qin go?

168
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,520
When will he come back?

169
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,880
You don't know? You know nothing.

170
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,470
What can you do? Check it out.

171
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,280
Sorry, Mr. Xia.

172
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,000
I heard it.

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,440
We really have the sincerity

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,280
to cooperate with you.

175
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,790
But Mr. Qin

176
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,110
is a man of true nature.

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,640
That's all right. We're leaving.

178
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,280
Mr. Xia.

179
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,790
Mr. Xia, is it proper for us

180
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,150
to leave in this way?

181
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,840
Why do we stay?

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
Shall we stay to help them

183
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,110
look for missing Mr. Qin?

184
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,550
Mr. Qin is too capricious.

185
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,910
Mr. Xia, do you have anything else to do?

186
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,790
If not,

187
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,880
I will go back first.

188
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,640
Well, Amy,

189
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,320
help me find all the mobile games

190
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
of the same type as Infinite.

191
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Sort out all the detailed reports

192
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,400
of the similar games in the last ten years.

193
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Give it to me tomorrow.

194
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,670
Mr. Xia, in ten years?

195
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,470
What do you order so much for?

196
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm really surprised that jealous Xia Ke

197
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,550
hasn't come with you.

198
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,230
He has social intercourses today.

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
You didn't mean it, did you?

200
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,280
Yes, I did.

201
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,960
I just like to see him jealous

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,280
and angry.

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,760
Well, women like you

204
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
just bought it, right?

205
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,350
Women like me?

206
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,030
Yes.

207
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Do women like you who are serious
about their relationship

208
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,910
feel that

209
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,440
only men like him who are serious and boring

210
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,030
are responsible for their relationship?

211
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,760
He isn't serious and boring.

212
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,640
He is strict and self-disciplined in his life.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,880
Strict and self-disciplined in his life.

214
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Go on.

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Why are you so strange today?

216
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,710
I have been happy and lighthearted
for more than 20 years.

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
I never thought

218
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,200
I could love someone so seriously

219
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
before I met you.

220
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
Let me finish first.

221
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,200
In fact, I recently realized that

222
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,550
I had been puzzled

223
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,400
by my pursuit of you before.

224
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,150
I played a dedicated man

225
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,030
and learned how to love someone.

226
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,790
This thing itself

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
is so fresh to me

228
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,550
that I mistakenly thought

229
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,350
I love you so much.

230
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,880
No, what are you trying to say?

231
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,150
I want to say that

232
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,640
I may have fallen in love this time.

233
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,030
I, I couldn't use the routines,

234
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,760
the time and the energy

235
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,150
I used on you

236
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,640
on her at all.

237
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,350
I don't think I'm in good shape right now.

238
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,470
No, do you understand it or not?

239
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,230
Forget about it. Eat.

240
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,670
Xia Ke.

241
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,110
Aunt.

242
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,550
What a beautiful voice you have!

243
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,110
Last time I didn't thank you for your cooking.

244
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,760
You don't need to thank me for just a meal.

245
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,000
If you like,

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,520
come to my home for dinner next time.

247
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,590
Are you waiting for Yun here?

248
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,880
She went to dinner with her friend

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,320
and won't be back until later.

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,080
I can call her

251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,400
if you need it.

252
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,550
No, thanks. Aunt, I'm,

253
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm working out.

254
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,030
You work out in this suit?

255
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,550
I'm used to it.

256
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,760
OK.

257
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,350
I'm used to it.

258
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,910
Fine, go on working out.

259
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,960
I'll go up first.

260
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm really curious about

261
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,710
who Xia Ke met today.

262
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,760
Mr. Qin of Tiange Investment.
It is hard to meet him.

263
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,670
Mr. Qin?

264
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
He is a wanderer.

265
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,110
Even his secretary doesn't usually know
where he is.

266
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,670
You're quite right.

267
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,960
Why hasn't she got off?

268
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,200
I think it's quite suitable for Mr. Qin

269
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,230
to invest in TIG.

270
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,440
I remember that he has a 17-year-old daughter

271
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,280
who is an animation fan.

272
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,000
She just came back from New York

273
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,030
and is on her summer holiday.

274
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,350
She's his sweetheart.

275
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,320
I remember her father

276
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,030
secretly bought her a coffee shop

277
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,880
with animation themes

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,710
because she visited it often.

279
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,550
Where is the coffee shop?

280
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,150
It's not far from your home.

281
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,030
I'll send you the location later.

282
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,670
Thank you.

283
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,670
Goodbye.

284
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,320
Bye.

285
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,880
One minute and 35 seconds.

286
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,080
Bye.

287
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,470
So long.

288
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
Are you waiting for me?

289
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,080
No, I'm feeding a stray cat.

290
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,550
Where is the stray cat?

291
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,550
Why didn't I see it?

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
A stray cat without conscience.

293
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
It ran away after I fed it.

294
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,670
There is one over there. Over there.

295
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,000
I mean you

296
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,200
who look cold outside but warm inside

297
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,080
and who clearly want attention

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,880
but pretend to be distant.

299
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Here's the danger zone.

300
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,190
We have to keep a safe distance.

301
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,350
What did He Yu ask you to do?

302
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,280
Nothing.

303
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,040
Why did you stay in the car
for 1 minute and 35 seconds

304
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,880
before you got off?

305
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,430
You said you didn't mean to wait for me.

306
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,800
What did he take you to eat?

307
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,520
Did he send you flowers?

308
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,310
Did he give you a gift?

309
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,800
If you hand it out right now,

310
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
I, I won't be mad.

311
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,640
He asked me out just to make you angry.

312
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Can you stop being so naive and let him succeed?

313
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,880
By the way, how was your talk with Mr. Qin today?

314
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,110
I didn't meet him. He flew away again.

315
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,040
He really is

316
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,830
a wanderer.

317
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't think we can wait

318
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
so passively.

319
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,040
I think it's time to help them find

320
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
this wayward boss.

321
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,000
Go back.

322
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,040
Why do you hide me up?

323
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,310
You're amazing,

324
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,000
so I have to hide you up.

325
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,160
Why don't you sleep yet?

326
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,880
You don't sleep either.

327
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,830
I just revised the project document.

328
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,680
I can't fall asleep.

329
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,310
You just drank too much coffee during the day

330
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,430
and stayed in the coffee shop for a long time.

331
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
Listen to me,

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
you don't have to wait for her tomorrow.

333
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,880
Now I'm beginning to wonder

334
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,800
if He Yu's information went wrong.

335
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,190
I don't think so.

336
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,470
Because there are a lot of
animation exhibitions recently.

337
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,800
Really?

338
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,880
That's why I failed to meet her these days.

339
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,430
Mr. Xia, I have a question for you.

340
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,470
Mr. Qin is always slippery as an eel

341
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,160
and doesn't look reliable.

342
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,310
Why did you choose him

343
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,280
among so many investors?

344
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,350
I have recently analyzed

345
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,400
some investment projects of Mr. Qin.

346
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,350
He has invested in two big domestic movies,

347
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,230
one online game and one mobile game.

348
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,710
None of these projects

349
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,280
belong to big companies,

350
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
but they are all high-quality good projects.

351
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,350
That means

352
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,830
Mr. Qin doesn't always want to make quick money,

353
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,760
and that he will give the team enough freedom

354
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,520
and autonomy.

355
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I find this very rare.

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,280
After listening to you,

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,230
I think I'm going to go all out
to help you find him.

358
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,160
Do you remember what I said to you?

359
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Give me your hand.

360
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,040
You just have to hold my hand

361
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,680
and stand by me.

362
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,350
Get bitten by mosquitoes together?

363
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,280
Come on.

364
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,640
Well, why does Yao Qing

365
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,560
always date someone in the company?

366
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,760
There are other fish in the sea.

367
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,590
Why does she insist on finding one in the company?

368
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,470
There is

369
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,190
one kind of women in the world...

370
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,560
There is one kind of women in the world

371
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,400
who likes to vent

372
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,760
their unquenchable jealousy in public.

373
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
Mr. He.

374
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't let me hear you talk about her,

375
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,400
or I don't know who's going to
make a fool of herself next time.

376
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,710
Are you publicly defending her?

377
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,160
Am I not?

378
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,760
Let me emphasize one more point.

379
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,520
It's not that she can't leave me.

380
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,680
It's that I'm chasing her desperately.

381
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,920
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

382
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,710
He Yu, you're capable.

383
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,280
You began to act in an idol drama, huh?

384
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,400
Don't you know that the company

385
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
expressly prohibits office romance?

386
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,830
You even bullied female employees, didn't you?

387
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,000
They reported it to me.

388
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,710
Anyway, I can't hide it this time.

389
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
What should you do?

390
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,800
Qian, do you think we are interns?

391
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,710
No, Yao Qing,

392
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,190
I did this for your own good. I mean it.

393
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,310
Look, you're promising.

394
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,470
Don't always hang out with him. It's not good.

395
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,560
First of all, I don't hang out with him.

396
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,800
If you insist,

397
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,110
please show me the evidence.

398
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,640
What more evidence is needed?

399
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,400
His words are evidence.

400
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,400
If one's pursuit is evidence,

401
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
he's probably not the only one

402
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,040
who's going to be fired

403
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,710
from the company.

404
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,710
Who else besides me?

405
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,760
Shut up.

406
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Second, if any gossip

407
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,710
is an office romance,

408
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,710
I wonder if what happened here at 2 a.m.
the night before last

409
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,160
is an office romance.

410
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,400
What happened?

411
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,070
I left a document in the company
the day before yesterday

412
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,920
and came back to get it.

413
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,710
It is a coincidence that

414
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,950
I found

415
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,160
the light in this office was still on.

416
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,710
I don't know if what I saw and heard

417
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,400
was conclusive evidence.

418
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
I was so careless.

419
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,880
What on earth is going on?

420
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,710
He has been flirting with
Daisy of Finance Department

421
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,710
for a long time.

422
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,000
He really thought we didn't know it.

423
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,190
Well, who else is chasing you in the company?

424
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,310
Oh, does it have anything to do with you?

425
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,110
Of course it does.

426
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,430
I told you I would be responsible for you.

427
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,640
I've told you a few times.

428
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,590
Stop talking such nonsense, OK?

429
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,800
OK.

430
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,310
Why don't you let me go with you?

431
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,880
Without doubt, it's easier for girls
to communicate with each other.

432
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,280
You'll make her alert if you come.

433
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,310
All right, it seems that you'll fail
to meet her again today.

434
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,710
Really?

435
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,110
I'm so sincere.

436
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,110
God should have arranged for us to meet.

437
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,560
Come back to dinner with me at night.

438
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,830
All right, I'll be right back.

439
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,190
But I look black in white.

440
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,800
Last time I wore clothes of this color.

441
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,830
Others thought

442
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,430
I failed to set off the clothes.

443
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,070
It's OK.

444
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,760
Then why not watch clothes of other colors?

445
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,710
This color is also OK. This one.

446
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,280
No. This suits you.

447
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,430
It suits you best.

448
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,640
Look, how pretty it is.

449
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,400
You finally appeared.

450
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,000
I found my target.

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Enjoy your dinner alone tonight.

452
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,110
I think this looks good.

453
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,400
Well, haven't seen you these days,

454
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,830
you are even good at painting.

455
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,160
It looks so good.

456
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,950
Really?

457
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,310
I think she uses yellowish green

458
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,280
so skillfully.

459
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,040
It's improper to use yellowish green

460
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,310
to describe such a pretty color.

461
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,400
It has a name, primrose.

462
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,760
Primrose?

463
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,560
I'm also a fine arts student.

464
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,160
Really?

465
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,520
Then can you watch my painting

466
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,190
to see whether it can be improved?

467
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,430
Surely. No problem.

468
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,920
Let me see.

469
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,310
Look, now you regard primrose
as the background color.

470
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,350
Then we can mix darker green

471
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,430
and paint it,

472
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,470
which can make your painting

473
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,520
have a better layer of sense.

474
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,590
Miss, you're an expert.

475
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Primrose. Good name.

476
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,350
So do other colors

477
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,920
also have such good Chinese names?

478
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,830
Surely.

479
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,880
Look at this color you used.

480
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,680
It's willow yellow.

481
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,230
This is green blue.

482
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,230
What are you doing?

483
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,520
I bought the stray cats downstairs this.

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
Now I'm doing an experiment with you.

485
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,230
No.

486
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,590
You've been working so hard.

487
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,070
Your cervical spine suffers.

488
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,950
But my hard work pays off.

489
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,000
Let me show you.

490
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,680
Xiaohe will give every state on my Moments

491
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
a like.

492
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
This is her favorite cartoon image.

493
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,880
Handsome, huh?

494
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,430
Don't move.

495
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,830
What are you doing?

496
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,920
Don't move.

497
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,350
Be a bit happy, OK?

498
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,070
Yes, I know.

499
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,070
I shouldn't force you

500
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,230
to attend such a role-playing party

501
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,310
of girls.

502
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,470
It's a special means in the special period.

503
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,680
Isn't it good for us to wear lovers' clothes?

504
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,350
Smile.

505
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,190
Xing Yun, you're here.

506
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,710
This is Yamasaki.

507
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,680
Come quickly. Yamasaki is coming.

508
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,680
So handsome.

509
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,760
Let's take a photo. Take a photo.

510
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,920
So these are all Xiaohe's paintings?

511
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,590
Yes. Awesome?

512
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,110
Yamasaki, my friend wants
to take a photo with you.

513
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,160
OK.

514
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,590
Let me help you take one.

515
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,350
Thank you.

516
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,590
Sorry. I'll answer a call.

517
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,310
Let's take ourselves.

518
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:40,950
OK.

519
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,560
Hello, dad.

520
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,430
Where are you?

521
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,520
Me? I'm having a party at home.

522
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
OK. Don't worry.

523
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,430
I'm OK.

524
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,880
OK. Bye.

525
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,680
Did you talk to your dad over the phone?

526
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,190
Yes.

527
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,110
You're home during the vacation.

528
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,310
Why don't they accompany you?

529
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,230
Oh, no need.

530
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,280
Everyone has a life.

531
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,230
I'm back because I like China.

532
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
You're so independent.

533
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,070
Actually, my dad loves me so much.

534
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,190
Every time I return home,

535
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,830
he'll try to find time to accompany me.

536
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,520
However, he has been stimulated by my mom lately,

537
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,800
so he went to date girls in Las Vegas.

538
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,000
Hello, Amy.

539
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,680
Help me find

540
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,190
the earliest flight to Las Vegas.

541
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,520
No matter what class or type,

542
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,560
the faster, the better.

543
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,800
I need a reply right now.

544
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,800
Bye.

545
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,430
Go.

546
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,070
Do you remember everything I told you?

547
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,800
Repeat.

548
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,880
Don't accept others' flowers.

549
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,110
Don't accept others' gifts.

550
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,110
Don't leave your phone number to others randomly.

551
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,310
Don't dine with or date other men

552
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,350
after ten o'clock in the evening.

553
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,920
Don't meet He Yu alone.

554
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,230
Don't always treat He Yu like this, OK?

555
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,920
OK, I won't see him.

556
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,110
I feel as if

557
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,230
I were 17 years old.

558
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,350
You seem to be my dad.

559
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,800
Well, come on.

560
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,710
I'd better take you with me.

561
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,160
I don't have a visa.

562
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,400
Yes.

563
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,230
I should have applied for a 10-year visa

564
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,070
for you.

565
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
But it's said that Las Vegas
is suitable for marriage.

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,190
You, you should understand

567
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,400
why you go there this time.

568
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,160
Mr. Xia, the fate of TIG is on you.

569
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,680
Thank you.

570
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,950
All right, it's almost time. Go in.

571
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,040
Send me a message when you land.

572
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,470
However, after I arrive,

573
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,590
it's supposed to be night here.

574
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,640
I won't get lost.

575
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,310
It's the habit of my family.

576
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,520
No matter who travels by air or train,

577
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,710
he'll send a message to tell us he is safe

578
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,190
at the departure and arrival times.

579
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,160
In this case, those who love you can rest assured.

580
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,040
For a long time, no one cared

581
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,110
where I would actually go

582
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,400
and when I would come back.

583
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,110
OK. Then I'm leaving.

584
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,710
Have a pleasant journey.

585
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,400
I'm leaving.

586
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,800
Bye-bye.

587
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,830
Hello, honey.

588
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,710
You're my only confidant.

589
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,280
When going to Las Vegas this time,

590
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,310
I'll take what I want most.

591
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,070
By then you'll be my first viewer.

592
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,470
I specially got a can of air

593
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,880
for you in the holy mountain of Nepal.

594
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,920
This is the smell of God,

595
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,830
symbolizing my love for you.

596
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,830
(Cooking procedures of omelet rice)

597
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,280
Peel the carrot and slice them with ham sausage.

598
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,950
Scald maize grains and green beans
with water respectively.

599
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,920
Add oil and stir-fry rice and vegetables.

600
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,710
Add ketchup, salt and white pepper.

601
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,110
(To Mascot: I've arrived. Good night.)

602
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,800
Because of the high popularity of the Internet

603
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,520
and the missing demographic dividend

604
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,680
at present,

605
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
such a market environment

606
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,230
plays...

607
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,800
Manager Yao, Mr. Ji sent you coffee.

608
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,910
Only several cups of coffee.
Is it necessary to interrupt our meeting?

609
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,630
No, there are 100 cups of coffee.

610
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,560
Everyone in our company has a cup.

611
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,840
Then give them to everyone.

612
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,320
He said

613
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,910
the coffee was used to cheer you on

614
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,630
and he would accompany you downstairs.

615
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,040
100 cups?

616
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,520
Qing, let's go to have Western food, OK?

617
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,600
Come on.

618
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,230
Be careful of your head.

619
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,600
Who are you?

620
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,630
You need not know.

621
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,000
Be reasonable, OK?

622
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,800
You hit my car.

623
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,190
Sorry, this, this is my colleague.

624
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,520
Your colleague.

625
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,150
What exactly do you want?

626
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,230
I think we need to talk.

627
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,760
What are you talking to her about?

628
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,390
Official business.

629
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,870
Talk about official business at night?

630
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,470
Thanks to you,

631
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,280
I am greatly refreshed after having your coffee.

632
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,360
So we decide to talk about official business
the whole night.

633
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,230
Then you should spit it out, you know?

634
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,120
Well, Mr. Xia, sorry.

635
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,670
We may not date today.

636
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,710
Let's date next time, OK?

637
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,710
Yes, Qing. Yes.

638
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,120
But I'm surnamed Ji rather than Xia.

639
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,470
Please go back, Mr. Chen.

640
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,870
I'm surnamed Ji.

641
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,520
Terribly sorry.

642
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,600
If you're surnamed Xia,

643
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,120
you can date her after a few days.

644
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,870
Why?

645
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:37,800
Because...

646
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,910
Mr. He, will you talk about official business with me?

647
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
She knows I'm surnamed He.

648
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,150
Bye-bye.

649
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,630
Qing, I'm surnamed Ji.

650
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm surnamed Ji. Do you know?

651
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,080
I'm surnamed Ji.

652
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,670
Let's have a midnight snack, OK?

653
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,670
What official business do you want to talk with me?

654
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,190
Please finish in five minutes.

655
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,430
Haven't you forgotten Xia Ke yet?

656
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,870
I don't think

657
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,560
it is official business.

658
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,430
I already said I could marry you.

659
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,870
Well, OK.

660
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,950
Then let's make it clear today.

661
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,390
I know it's so hard for you to forget something,

662
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,840
but He Yu,

663
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,360
it can't happen again anyway, right?

664
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,080
Regard it

665
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,800
as a little episode in your long life, OK?

666
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,520
Don't take it to heart.

667
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,670
Little episode?

668
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,520
Could a little episode

669
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,870
mess up my life?

670
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,320
Why is your life in a mess?

671
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,950
Don't you enjoy your life?

672
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,520
I was just crossed in love.

673
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,560
I don't even have time to heal.

674
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,710
I think

675
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,840
how to face you every day.

676
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,840
After I go home and lie on bed,

677
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,520
my mind is very much engaged with you

678
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
and what happened that night.

679
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,390
Then please forget

680
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,360
what happened that night.

681
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,080
We aren't suitable.

682
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,710
We can't be together.

683
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,000
Why?

684
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,670
He Yu,

685
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,840
we know so much about each other.

686
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You've watched me fall in love
with other secretly for so many years.

687
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,080
I also helped you chase the girls you liked.

688
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,040
Imagine. If we're together,

689
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,000
there will be those scenes in which we like others

690
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,230
in our minds.

691
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,710
Don't you think it's a torture?

692
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,710
We can forget.

693
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,000
I can't.

694
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,950
And let me tell you, He Yu.

695
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,430
What happened that night

696
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,360
isn't an accident at all.

697
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
For me, you were just

698
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,910
a substitute for Xia Ke.

699
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,150
I also get such a good man card.

700
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,600
Since so,

701
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,080
you should know what to do, right?

702
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,710
Surely.

703
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,120
It's meaningless to bother you again.

704
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,670
Well, it's settled.

705
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:47,910
OK.

706
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,950
Mr. Qin.

707
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,520
You are...

708
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,800
Xia Ke of TIG.

709
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Xia Ke?

710
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,360
I heard of this name.

711
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,760
You're that young man

712
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,190
forced out by Mr. Sun beyond the circle.

713
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,800
Yes.

714
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,760
I watched the games in your company.

715
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,710
They're very good.

716
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,000
It's a coincidence that we meet here.

717
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,710
Not exactly. I specially came for you.

718
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,280
How do you know I'm here?

719
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,040
As long as you have a heart,
there is nothing out of the question.

720
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,080
It's him.

721
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,000
Do you know him?

722
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,190
I happened to meet him once.

723
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,630
You admire him very much.

724
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,390
It's my wife rather than me

725
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,280
who admires him.

726
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,910
She thinks this young and handsome man

727
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,560
has a pure soul.

728
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,600
I always can't figure out

729
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,800
what the art fascinating my wife

730
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,190
is actually.

731
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,080
With respect,

732
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,280
your wife may misjudge him.

733
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,390
Great minds think alike.

734
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,800
Did you think

735
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,360
to buy over him?

736
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,080
It's easy to say that.

737
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,430
Don't you think I tried?

738
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,430
I'll give you 10 million.

739
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,800
Please help me corrupt his pure soul.

740
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,800
I swear

741
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,360
as long as I see money,

742
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,320
I'll absolutely have nothing to do with Mrs. Qin.

743
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,000
Mr. Qin, please don't worry.

744
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,560
I also sent people

745
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,760
to contact him.

746
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,040
As long as they talked about money with him,

747
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,910
he incessantly talked with them

748
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,150
about art.

749
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,000
He said he and my wife

750
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,950
were a spiritual couple

751
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
and asked them not to tarnish their pure friendship.

752
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,520
How could you

753
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,950
make it?

754
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,120
I told him

755
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,360
you and your wife were
having your divorce proceedings handled.

756
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,230
He keeps

757
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,950
badgering your wife

758
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,470
in the name of art,

759
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,470
which is a lot more cost-effective
than your hammer deal.

760
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,560
But on the contrary,

761
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,080
he may pay so much

762
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,950
if he gives up the whole forest

763
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,080
for your wife, right?

764
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,190
You're really smart.

765
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,910
I greatly admire you.

766
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,150
Let's talk about cooperation
when I got to work.

767
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,630
Listen,

768
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,600
Las Vegas is a city of fun.

769
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,710
Come on, let's have a good drink.

770
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,600
Then let's gamble heartily in the casino.

771
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,760
But Mr. Qin,

772
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,600
I won't go later

773
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,080
as my girlfriend is inspecting me.

774
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,600
What?

775
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,390
I didn't expect

776
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,120
you are hen-pecked.

777
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,910
Mr. Qin, excuse me.

778
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,320
So punctual.

779
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,120
Didn't you ask me to call you on time?

780
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,630
I set the alarm clock on purpose.

781
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,040
Where are you? Why is it so noisy?

782
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,520
I'm at the bar with Mr. Qin.

783
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,390
You already saw Mr. Qin.

784
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,120
It seems that it is going well.

785
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,280
Then I won't bother you.

786
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,320
Enjoy yourselves.

787
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,080
It's said Las Vegas has a lot of good shows

788
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,470
and a great night life.

789
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,870
Do you know what time it is?

790
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,280
It must be midnight in your place.

791
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,950
Then you still ask me to enjoy myself?

792
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,760
I...

793
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,600
Hello.

794
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,600
Why is he angry?

795
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,320
Isn't Las Vegas an ever-bright city?

796
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,280
Mr. Qin, then I'll leave first.

797
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,470
Don't you go to the casino?

798
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,430
No.

799
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,470
Over there.

800
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,360
Where did you go?

801
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,430
We were looking for you.

802
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,390
I just received a call.

803
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,080
I wonder whether Mr. Xia

804
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,520
gets any investment in the US?

805
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,910
Not bad.

806
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,080
He and Mr. Qin feel like old friends
at the first meeting.

807
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,280
He sent me an e-mail

808
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,150
and asked me to revise the project report
as soon as possible.

809
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,910
That's great.

810
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,630
It seems our TIG finally got through this crisis.

811
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,840
Yes.

812
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,390
The crisis makes Mr. Xia

813
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,950
almost bankrupt.

814
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,670
If he can't get an investment again,

815
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,190
I guess he has to mortgage that luxury villa.

816
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,360
Mortgage?

817
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,670
Didn't he sell it?

818
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,870
No, then where can he live?

819
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,120
I saw he kept

820
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,430
living in the company all the time.

821
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,630
And I also saw him

822
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,710
talking about sales of the house with an intermediary.

823
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,560
Mr. Xia seems to have other invested houses.

824
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,950
He shouldn't sell the house he lives in.

825
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,670
He stayed in the company for a long time

826
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,800
to handle the investment.

827
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,320
And the moment Lucky is back,

828
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,360
Mr. Xia hasn't slept

829
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,670
in the company again.

830
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
I want to check

831
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,670
what time you actually want to work.

832
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,320
Don't pick me up. I'll go back right now.

833
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,430
You're lucky.

834
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,280
Mr. Xia, I heard you had even sold your house

835
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,840
for TIG.

836
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,470
Take it as the repayment of mascot.

837
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,800
Anyhow, Aunt Wang doesn't take my money.

838
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,760
What's the matter with you?

839
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,760
What's the matter with you?

840
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,360
My God.

841
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,560
So heavy.

842
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,080
My feet hurt.

843
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,150
Are you OK?

844
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,280
Listen.

845
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,470
We've built our bodies for days.
So just exert ourselves.

846
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,520
So heavy.

847
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,950
We can enter as long as I crack the password now.

848
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,080
Xing Yun, are you really going to do that?

849
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,470
I haven't come out

850
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,560
from the shock of your being with Mr. Xia?

851
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,470
To stay with you day and night,

852
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,120
Mr. Xia gives up his villa

853
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,000
and chooses to stay in your shabby house.

854
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,000
Is my house shabby?

855
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The rent is 5,000 yuan a month.

856
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,150
Is Xing Yun

857
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,710
the future boss lady of TIG?

858
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,560
So we can be promoted and get rich

859
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,080
as long as we ride her coattails, right?

860
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,320
You snob.

861
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,390
Stop talking that.

862
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,190
Help me think what the password is actually.

863
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,360
Yes, boss lady.

864
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
The password...

865
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,320
What passwords did you try?

866
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,120
Before he changed it,
it was the last four figures of his ID card.

867
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,120
I just tried the last four figures of his bank card,

868
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,600
the founding day of TIG, and the online day of game.

869
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,080
So stupid.

870
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,040
Try your birthday date.

871
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,800
Anything else?

872
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,230
The day when you dated for the first time.

873
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,630
The day when you kissed for the first time.

874
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,840
The day when you lived together for the first time.

875
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,840
Don't be shy. Try it.

876
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,600
Don't be shy. Quickly.

877
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,800
Which day?

878
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,520
Right.

879
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,560
Right.

880
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,280
What day is this?

881
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,000
The day when he met me.

882
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,760
Go.

883
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,190
Wait a moment.

884
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,000
Let me carry it.

885
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,630
I'll carry it.

886
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,080
You weak chick.

887
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,840
The day when he met you.
