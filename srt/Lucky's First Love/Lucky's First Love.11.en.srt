00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,540
=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,580
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,140
What's wrong with Mr. Xia today?

4
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,700
He seemed fine yesterday.

5
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
What was the secret technique
I saw last time

6
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,900
for these claw machines?

7
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,500
Up, up, down, down, left, left, right, right?

8
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,340
Xing Yun! Xing Yun!

9
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,740
Xiaoxi!

10
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,300
What are you doing here alone?

11
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,380
My mom and dad went out to buy something.

12
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,820
They left me here for the moment.

13
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,540
They'll be back soon.

14
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,900
Your dad?

15
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,140
Yeah, my dad's back.

16
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,100
Yesterday, Xia Ke even
had an argument with him.

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
He's even arguing?

18
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,780
I see why he's in such a bad mood.

19
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,740
Your dad's back,

20
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,700
so you must be happy.

21
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,900
Kind of.

22
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,460
Xiaopang and Xiaopan won't say anything
to me anymore.

23
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,180
But I think Chu Nan is just

24
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,500
that little bit better.

25
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,220
Xing Yun, are you going to play the claw machine?

26
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,940
I want to, too.

27
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,940
Alright!

28
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,060
Up, up, down, down, left, left, right, right.

29
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,340
Xing Yun, can you give it to me?

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,060
Of course!

31
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
Yun Xing, you know,

32
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
my mom's no good at catching these.

33
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,620
Ever since Chu Nan stopped coming,

34
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,300
I've never been able to get one.

35
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,060
Then, does Chu Nan know your dad is back?

36
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,220
I told him.

37
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,700
Let's catch another one.

38
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,220
Which one do you want?

39
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,620
Xing Yun.

40
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,580
Shen Qing.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,300
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,780
Mom!

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,460
I came to get some groceries
and saw Xiaoxi here.

44
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,060
Hi, I'm Xiaoxi's dad, Ling Shan.

45
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,660
You're...

46
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,540
Hi, my name's Xing Yun.

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,660
I'm...

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,900
She's a friend of Xia Ke's and mine.

49
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,180
Thanks for watching Xiaoxi.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,820
Mom, look!

51
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,820
Xing Yun catches this toy for me.

52
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,620
Very good!

53
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,460
Xiaoxi,

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,140
I got you some ice cream.

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,140
I like chocolate flavored ice cream.

56
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,380
I see.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I'll get some next time, OK?

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,180
Where are you headed? Do you need a lift?

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,340
That's OK, I'm very close.

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
I can get there by bike.

61
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,580
Then, we'll be going.

62
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,700
Bye.

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,420
Bye-bye.

64
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,420
I've already handed over the updated copy
to the play testers.

65
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,860
This is their preliminary feedback.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,340
Among which, playability

67
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,660
in the pizza production and shooting is very high.

68
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,460
Next week, I'll organize usability testing

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,860
and get some deeper data.

70
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,620
Who wrote this copy?

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,060
I did.

72
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,900
Are you making a children's puzzle game

73
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
or a dating simulator?

74
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,700
Mr. Xia, the situation is that

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,260
we've only updated the framework.

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,460
The copy planning particulars
will be completed next week.

77
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,540
This is just a rough draft.

78
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,660
Next week? Why is always next week?

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,900
This week. We can finish it this week.

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,980
Is it this week or next week?

81
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,300
Is this meeting for the purpose of discussing the time?

82
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,820
We'll have it ready by this Friday, for sure.

83
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,820
What about the contents of the private kitchen?

84
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,980
We all think the private kitchen is very romantic.

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,940
It's a pity for it to be in the adventure module,

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,220
so we moved it to the core project.

87
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,220
Right, right.

88
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,740
The environment and the text underneath the plates
were very interesting.

89
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,020
I'll say this once more.

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,020
I don't pay you

91
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
to tell me what's interesting.

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,460
What I want is results.

93
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,300
If it's not on my desk by this Friday,

94
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,740
you can all pack your bags.
And ready to resign.

95
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Understood, Mr. Xia.

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,020
That'll be all.

97
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,520
(President's Office)

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:07,980
Enter.

99
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,460
Mr. Xia.

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,420
Haven't you been told enough?

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,140
I have, I have.

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,340
After that telling off
I don't even need to eat dinner.

103
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,100
What do you want?

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,740
I don't need to eat, but you must be hungry.

105
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
Would like me to order something for you?

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,620
You've been so busy these days,

107
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,220
you haven't even sent me to get you coffee.

108
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,260
How about I go make you a cup to help you recharge?

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Americano, 4 cups water and 6 cups coffee beans.

110
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,140
I even used the coffee beans Miss. Yao brought back.

111
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,220
This cup

112
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,860
is sure to make your troubles go away.

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,860
It's so sweet.

114
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,580
You've done this deliberately.

115
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,020
I didn't.

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,780
I just felt like you haven't been eating properly

117
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,860
these days,

118
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,620
so I added some sugar.

119
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,220
Otherwise, you won't have the energy

120
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,020
to tell us off.

121
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Why are you still here?

122
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,980
Mr. Xia, have you been unhappy recently?

123
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
Is that any of your business?

124
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,460
No, I just want to remind you

125
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,020
that you're face of TIG.

126
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,860
Do you know how many people are
going all out to work overtime

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,340
because of the way you look?

128
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,460
No matter how you get hurt,
you mustn't hurt your image.

129
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,620
What gives you the right

130
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,340
to tell your boss what to do?

131
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
I'm acting out of genuine concern.

132
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,700
I pray to the lucky cat every day

133
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,140
that your spirits will be back up again.

134
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
Otherwise, we'll die under your tyranny

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,260
before Instance Zones even goes online.

136
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,340
Leave.

137
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,900
Come on.

138
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,620
Catch it!

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,220
OK.

140
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Chu Nan!

141
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Chu Nan!

142
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Chu Nan! Play soccer with me.

143
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,020
Play soccer with me.

144
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,540
Take the ball.

145
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,180
Who are you?

146
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,540
This is Chu Nan.

147
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Xiaoxi, go and play over there.

148
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,980
No.

149
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,260
Do as you're told, let the adults talk.

150
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,260
Go inside and wait for me.

151
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,580
I wanted to see you.

153
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,180
Shen Qing has always been very beautiful.

154
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,820
There have always been a lot of guys like you

155
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,900
who can't stop chasing after her.

156
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,380
But if you keep this up, it's harassment.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,940
Harassment is a crime.

158
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,820
What a reason would a man have

159
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,980
to suddenly return

160
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,140
four years after abandoning his wife and child?

161
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,740
Do I owe you an explanation?

162
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,500
Chu Nan, go home.

163
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,860
Don't come back again.

164
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,420
I've learned how to make a few new dishes recently.

165
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,260
I'll make some for you and Xiaoxi tonight.

166
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,220
It seems you've been doing well.

167
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,500
Dad, can we invite Chu Nan in

168
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,900
so we can play video games together?

169
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Look, your clothes have gotten filthy.

170
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,700
Go and get changed first.

171
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,340
What are you looking at?

172
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,460
Ling Shan, what just happened...

173
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,340
I know, you're using me an excuse to avoid him.

174
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,700
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,300
It's OK. It makes me feel useful

176
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,260
to know I'm helping you deal with the guys
who chase after you.

177
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,700
You have to acknowledge

178
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,780
that you and Xiaoxi need me.

179
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,020
Well, I'm a bit exhausted.

180
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,180
You should head home.

181
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,500
If you need anything, just call.

182
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,980
Hey, have you made any new friends lately?

183
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,020
No, I'm at work every day.

184
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,340
Where would I find the time to make friends?

185
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,500
Are you still not over that thing
that's been troubling you?

186
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,620
Mom, what are you talking about?

187
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,020
I put that behind me a while ago now.

188
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,180
Really?

189
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,860
Xing Cheng said

190
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,980
that Chu Nan hasn't been performing well
at work lately.

191
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
She said...

192
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,820
How did she describe him?

193
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,780
Like a lost soul.

194
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,980
Serves him right.

195
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,860
Dad!

196
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,300
What?

197
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,020
He isn't interested in my wonderful daughter,

198
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,220
so it serves him right.

199
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:04,980
Right?

200
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,420
Right, right.

201
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,580
Yeah, it serves him right.

202
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,980
There's anything for either of us
to be interested in.

203
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Forget it.

204
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,260
You guys watch, I'm going.

205
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
You're going to hide in your room again?

206
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,220
Hide, go ahead. Hide.

207
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,740
Look, do you want me to have Xing Cheng

208
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,220
introduce someone else to you?

209
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,580
Forget it.

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
(Reply at once: Come pick me up.
Address: Weisen Bar)

211
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,820
Where are you going at such a late hour?

212
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,620
Having a phone and Wechat

213
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,580
adds at least four hours of work

214
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,660
every day.

215
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm going to work.

216
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,020
Sorry, we're full.

217
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,420
No, I've come to pick someone up.

218
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,020
I'm sorry.

219
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,820
Excuse me.

220
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,180
You're full and you still let someone in?

221
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,580
Sorry, now we're full.

222
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,820
Hello, the number you have dialed
is currently busy.

223
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,180
Since you never answer your phone,

224
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,820
why don't you just get a pager?

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,700
Mr. Xia, I'm at the door,

226
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,940
but the doorman says it's full.

227
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,980
Come outside.

228
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,700
You're not allowed in if you look scruffy.

229
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,140
Find a way to get inside.

230
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,300
This place is nowhere near full,

231
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,060
OK?

232
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,140
Lucky!

233
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,580
What are you doing here?

234
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,100
Look.

235
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,860
Mr. Xia. Mr. Xia.

236
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,500
Mr. Xia.

237
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,540
What's going on?

238
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,500
What a bore!

239
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,980
You're quite capable.

240
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,140
Beautiful legs are the best credentials.

241
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,540
Is playing around with other people's phones fun?

242
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,300
This is annoying for me too.

243
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,820
If you were willing to answer my calls,

244
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
this wouldn't have been such a hassle.

245
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,460
Bye.

246
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,700
You're here now. Have a drink.

247
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,180
I'm not interested.

248
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,220
Take this cup and pour it on me
to make you feel better. OK?

249
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,020
Alright, there really is a situation.

250
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,740
He's drunk himself unconscious,

251
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,060
and I can't move him alone.

252
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,540
Bartender, give me a cup of warm water.

253
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,740
Thanks.

254
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,900
I really envy Xia Ke

255
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
for having an assistant as capable as you.

256
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,900
Cut the crap and lift him up.

257
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,140
He really drank a lot.

258
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,180
Help me.

259
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm coming.

260
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
You've done this before.

261
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,020
You even know his password.

262
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,140
You've been here even more often than me.

263
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,420
This's a man's home.

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,020
Mr. Xia's company doesn't discriminate
between men and women.

265
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,420
I'm always coming to work overtime.

266
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,460
Yeah, that's his style.

267
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,980
When we were at college,

268
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,300
he'd often have us all over at his apartment

269
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,940
to do research on a project.

270
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,700
But, this is the first time he's been so drunk.

271
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,100
Why?

272
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,460
Maybe it's because of the ads entrance channels.

273
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,540
He's had a lot on his mind lately
and hasn't had enough rest.

274
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,220
That's why.

275
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,780
The way he's been acting recently,

276
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,740
treating everyone like an enemy,

277
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,020
and he still has a mind for social activities?
Hasn't he offended any clients?

278
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,860
I see.

279
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
Ling Shan's been back recently, hasn't he?

280
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,020
Ling Shan, Shen Qing's ex-husband.

281
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,180
What exactly is the problem
between Mr. Xia and Ling Shan?

282
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,100
Don't look at me like that.

283
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,780
If you look at me like that,

284
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,780
I might lose control and let out a big secret.

285
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,860
If you won't tell me, forget it. I'm going.

286
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,220
Wait.

287
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,340
I guess I can tell you.

288
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,500
Four years ago, Xia Ke and Ling Shan locked horns.

289
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,100
They decided to settle things with a car race.

290
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,700
In the end, Xia Ke crashed into Ling Shan, injuring him.

291
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,500
Later on, Ling Shan left the hospital
without saying a word.

292
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,940
He just left a letter filing divorce

293
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,220
with the then-pregnant Shen Qing.

294
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,900
Shen Qing went abroad and gave birth to Xiaoxi,

295
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,460
with her back turned to the Xia family.

296
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,340
Then, Mr. Xia must blame himself.

297
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,380
Blame himself?

298
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
He crashed into Ling Shan.

299
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,180
That's why Ling Shan left Shen Qing.

300
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,060
It's the middle of the afternoon
and you've already had so much to drink.

301
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,780
The next time you get drunk, don't call me.

302
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,380
My friend here has a cold exterior,
but he's a nice person.

303
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,340
He says he won't come, but he still comes.

304
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,780
Hi, I'm He Yu's friend.

305
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,980
My name's Linda. You are...

306
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,420
Someone you'll never meet again.

307
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,500
OK.

308
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,980
He, see you next time.

309
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,300
OK, my good friend.

310
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,460
The door's locked.

311
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,220
I...

312
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,460
Mr. Xia,

313
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,740
we've drawn up an announcement,

314
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,820
and are getting ready to make it public.

315
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,140
We'll be saying that you and Ling Shan

316
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,220
had an accident due to speeding.

317
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,660
What about the girl?

318
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,980
We'll have her transferred to another hospital

319
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,820
before the press arrive.

320
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,540
She agrees?

321
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,460
She'll give us her bank account details.

322
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,660
That's Chairman Xia for you, neat and tidy.

323
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,700
Xia Ke's grandmother

324
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,180
thought that her grandson-in-law having an affair

325
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,540
was a disgrace.

326
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,420
So, calling on various connections,

327
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,700
had the third party erased from the story.

328
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,180
Even Shen Qing herself doesn't know.

329
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,820
In this case,

330
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,100
I think Shen Qing needn't

331
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,420
learn of this either.

332
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,700
You would have Shen Qing carry on

333
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
being with someone like that?

334
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,740
Grandma,

335
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,180
you have a hundred reasons

336
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,580
to make this person leave Shen Qing.

337
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,260
Madam, the young master has a point.

338
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,100
This way,

339
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,020
we can minimize the emotional damage to Shen Qing.

340
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,460
Do you think she'll forgive you?

341
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,900
It doesn't matter to me.

342
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,260
Then, that's what we'll do.

343
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,780
So, that means Shen Qing still doesn't know

344
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
about Ling Shan cheating on her?

345
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,060
Why did Mr. Xia want to hide it from her?

346
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,020
Maybe he was afraid
that Shen Qing wouldn't be able to take

347
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,860
having been betrayed by Ling Shan.

348
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,380
Those two grew up together.

349
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,660
And, it was very difficult

350
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,660
for them to be able to end up together.

351
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,340
Emotional wounds hurt the most.

352
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,700
Who is it?

353
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,180
Mr. An.

354
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,620
Grandma.

355
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,060
It's illegal

356
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,860
for you to address me as such.

357
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,420
But, you don't have the right anymore.

358
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,580
This is a 250 square meter apartment

359
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,340
in Eternal Gardens in Sanya,

360
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,580
and a car.

361
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,580
They are currently listed as the company's assets.

362
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
You can make them yours.

363
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,700
The condition

364
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,380
is that you never show your face
in front of the Xia family again.

365
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,820
I'll give you two days to think it over.

366
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,660
Grandma,

367
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm truly grateful to you.

368
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,540
With my leg

369
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,220
disabled now thanks to Xia Ke,

370
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,940
how am I supposed to survive?

371
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,340
I need to eat. I need to find a job.

372
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,180
What can I do?

373
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,820
Mr. Ling, the doctor has said

374
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,060
that your leg will recover quickly.

375
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:49,980
Mr. An.

376
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,220
I'll add 2 million as well.

377
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,100
Thank you, grandma.

378
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,860
I think your suggestion was correct.

379
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,700
For some people,

380
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,940
it's best not to ever see their true colors.

381
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,620
For all these years,

382
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,060
Shen Qing has believed Xia Ke

383
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,740
to be the one who broke up her family.

384
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,780
It's been a long time,

385
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,180
but they still have this between them.

386
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,780
So, Mr. Xia has taken the blame all this time,

387
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,140
just to protect Shen Qing's

388
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,300
memory of her first love?

389
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,580
You think he's an idiot, don't you?

390
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,540
For someone as acerbic

391
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,340
and independent as Shen Qing,

392
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,900
Xia Ke's the only one
who worries about how she feels.

393
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,820
Maybe it's because she's his own sister

394
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
that he's blind to the truth.

395
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,420
Anyway, for someone

396
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,460
as self-determined as Xia Ke,

397
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,620
it's not any woman who could rein him in.

398
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,660
He is really stupid.

399
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,420
But, he's really sympathetic and righteous.

400
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,940
Don't misunderstand me.

401
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,500
What I mean is that

402
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,700
you shouldn't be so quick
to challenge such a complicated man.

403
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,660
Someone like me, who wears their heart on their sleeve

404
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,220
and is open and honest, is a better fit for you.

405
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,660
Don't you think, Lucky?

406
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,180
Who gave you permission to call her that?

407
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,260
Mr. Xia, when did you wake up?

408
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,820
Mr. Xia, are, are you OK?

409
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,660
You can go, Lucky.

410
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,540
Mr. Xia is awake now.

411
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,220
You aren't needed now.

412
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,260
We can finish our heart-to-heart another day.

413
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,940
Mr. Xia, are you OK?

414
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,220
Mr. Xia, I really never realized

415
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,740
that you had such a strong moral fiber.

416
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,420
Did you drink bad wine too?

417
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,500
What are you raving about?

418
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,580
Well, I'll leave some honey here for you.

419
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,620
Remember to take it.

420
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,620
I saw a few bags of fast food in the fridge too.

421
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,300
It was all expired.

422
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,460
I threw it out for you.

423
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,980
If there's nothing else, I'll see myself out.

424
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,020
Maybe you can tell me, Mr. Xia,

425
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,820
what I should be calling her?

426
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,300
You should head home too.

427
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,220
Give her a ride home.

428
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,900
Aren't you trying to date her?

429
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,260
Be sincere.

430
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,940
My employees aren't the same as other girls.

431
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,140
Is that a challenge? Perfect.

432
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
The little monkey Bobby climbed up the tree.

433
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,020
His dad...

434
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,700
Mom, are you and dad getting back together?

435
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,300
Xiaoxi, you want your dad, don't you?

436
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,180
I want Chu Nan.

437
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,260
Why wouldn't you let Chu Nan play soccer with me?

438
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,620
Chu Nan has his own life.

439
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,700
Don't you like him anymore?

440
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,100
Baby, there are many different kinds of love.

441
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,140
You'll understand when you've grown up.

442
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,220
Just as mom loves you

443
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,620
yet I can't be with you forever.

444
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,780
To have someone in your heart

445
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,860
and carry the memories of that person in your heart

446
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,060
while going on with your life

447
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,540
is another kind of love.

448
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,220
Hello, Mr. Xia.

449
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,420
Have you arrived home?

450
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,060
I've only just got in the car.

451
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,900
Is there something you need?

452
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,860
Where's He Yu?

453
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,500
He's next to me.

454
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,980
He said you told him to send me home

455
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,820
so I just...

456
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,300
Right now I need you to

457
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,660
explain to me the testing plan for Instance Zones

458
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,420
and how you plan to modify it.

459
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,700
Right now?

460
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,860
Is there something wrong with your ears?

461
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,100
No, but I don't have anything with me right now.

462
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,380
Explain your thoughts on it.

463
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,820
I've discussed it with the copywriters,

464
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,300
and we've divided the plan into stages,

465
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,740
starting with the scenerio,

466
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,300
mainly...

467
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,500
What are you doing back here?

468
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,940
I always thought I had the qualities of a leading man.

469
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,020
It turns out I'm someone else's supporting role.

470
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,580
Is the alcohol you serve here watered down?

471
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,500
How did he wake up after barely falling asleep?

472
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,420
Mr. He, you have today.

473
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,700
Are you serious?

474
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
It's impossible.

475
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,700
You people,

476
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,700
the more you suspect
I'm not serious about this kind of thing,

477
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,180
the more I want to make you see me serious.

478
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,260
That would seem to be rash.

479
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,060
He, you're here!

480
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,940
Why do you look so unhappy?

481
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,780
You've got the wrong person.

482
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm his twin brother, He Jian.

483
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,300
I've just come back from America.

484
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,220
Oh please, come off it.

485
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,380
Who are you?

486
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,260
Wait, are you serious?

487
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,020
You look exactly like him.

488
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,380
He Jian, I kept you waiting.

489
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,580
This is...

490
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,500
I don't know who that is.

491
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,700
Speak. Are you cheating on me?

492
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,740
No, no, no.

493
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,940
You've misunderstood.

494
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,780
I'm a friend of his brother's.

495
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,300
So, you guys chat.

496
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,900
Humph.

497
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,660
Whiskey, no ice.

498
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,100
I sent Mr. Xia home a while ago.

499
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,540
You're too late.

500
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,740
I just thought I'd drop by and have a drink.

501
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,820
How do you plan to thank me?

502
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
If we stay here our cover will be blown sooner or later.

503
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,500
Let's go.

504
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,580
I'll take you somewhere very, very, very special...

505
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,020
I just got here.

506
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,540
Your drink.

507
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,380
Thanks.

508
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,340
Do you remember, during the summer holidays,
the three of us...

509
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Enjoy.

510
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,300
...would come here twice every week?

511
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,100
Wasn't that because a certain someone said

512
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,180
that you can't write a paper
without drinking wine and eating meat?

513
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,900
There's just one thing I'm very curious about.

514
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,860
Don't ask. Don't be curious.

515
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,700
No, tell me.

516
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,380
Anyone with a pair of eyes

517
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,740
could see that you liked him.

518
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,140
Why didn't you tell him?

519
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,580
Especially that year,

520
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,380
if it were you who confessed how you felt back then,

521
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,740
then you'd have been the one to end up with Xia Ke.

522
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,380
You know what?

523
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,100
Then, I'd also have been the one to break up with him.

524
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,220
No, you...

525
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,700
You can't avoid eating because you're scared of choking.

526
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,060
Oh, I just don't like forcing things.

527
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,100
How does that story go?

528
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,340
You should wait for love, not seek it out.

529
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,340
You drink alone and reject a woman.

530
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,500
I think even with all energy
you've spent seeking someone out,

531
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,020
you still haven't had a good result.

532
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,780
Judging by your current pace,
you must have broken up with her already.

533
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,700
It's all Mr. Xia's fault.

534
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,900
I haven't won her over yet.

535
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
Sometimes I wonder,

536
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,780
do you think he really isn't aware

537
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,820
of his own feelings,

538
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,460
or is he just committed to never expressing them?

539
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,980
Does she like Xia Ke?

540
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,500
It's hard to say.

541
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:00,300
Should the two of us form a dating alliance?

542
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,940
How did you know I was here?

543
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,140
It turns out Zhang Rui was a coach here.

544
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
I have eyes here.

545
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,460
If you're so able to win the favor of people,

546
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,300
maybe all of TIG

547
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,300
will end up in your hands.

548
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,340
Well, I heard that recently

549
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,220
the president of TIG has been in a bad mood.

550
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,740
Everyone in the company is scared of losing their job.

551
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,660
What is it? Has something happened?

552
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,940
It's nothing.

553
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:56,860
OK.

554
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,260
I have an official reason to come see you today.

555
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,260
I sent the contract for our cooperation

556
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,460
to you.

557
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,060
What do you think?

558
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,860
I think the financing has a slight problem.

559
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,700
The company's finance department
will send a copy of the file over.

560
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,980
I'll have her discuss it with you then.

561
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,660
Mr. Xia. Miss Yao, you're here too.

562
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,420
Is she your finance department?

563
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,100
Xing Yun, you really are a multi-talented individual.

564
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,740
At once an original animation artist,
planner, president's assistant,

565
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,300
and now you're an accountant too.

566
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,460
No, Miss Yao,

567
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,460
you've misunderstood.

568
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,500
I'm just running an errand.

569
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,100
It's not like I can tell you that no one dared to come,

570
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,540
and that I drew the short straw.

571
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:53,660
Coach!

572
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,980
Well, you're here. You as well give this a try.

573
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,540
No, no, I'm really bad at sports.

574
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,660
You're normally bent over a desk.

575
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,420
You need to get some exercise.

576
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,060
Let me tell you, our coach is really good.

577
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,060
Xia Ke and I

578
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,740
usually train under him.

579
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,660
Teach her a couple moves.

580
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,620
Coach, I can't.

581
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,980
Can we just get to the training?

582
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,980
Ouch!

583
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,540
Strike the center of the sword.

584
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:54,980
Here?

585
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,300
Yeah.

586
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,540
OK, harder.

587
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
Harder.

588
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,740
It looks like she really isn't cut out

589
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,540
for this kind of sport.

590
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,140
Here.

591
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,620
Hold it properly.

592
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,940
Grab it here, a little higher.

593
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,020
Here, put this hand here.

594
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,700
Lower.

595
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,300
One, two, three.

596
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,620
Lower.

597
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:38,900
Here.

598
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,140
One, two, three.

599
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,180
I'll contact your finance department

600
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,780
about the contract.

601
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,740
I'll be going now.

602
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Mr. Xia, are you headed back to the office?

603
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,820
Of course.

604
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,700
Then, why did you have me bring that file?

605
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,220
Did I have you bring it?

606
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,580
But, it's time for me to head back
to the office and take a look,

607
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,780
and see why you're the only one with any free time.

608
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,660
I don't have any free time.

609
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,140
Because I've been drawing the short straw lately,

610
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,740
I've been running errands everywhere.

611
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,980
What's wrong with your hand?

612
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,900
You haven't stopped rubbing your hand
since changing your clothes just now.

613
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,180
Maybe I sprained it a little after falling down just now.

614
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:24,580
It's fine.

615
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,660
Wait for me in the car.

616
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,820
Where are you going?

617
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,500
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

618
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,700
I bought you ice cream
so you could use it as an ice-pack,

619
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
because there aren't any medicine shops nearby.

620
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,980
You want me to use such expensive ice cream
as an ice-pack?

621
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,060
That's just a waste.

622
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,060
I may as well eat it.

623
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,020
I...

624
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,460
It's pressing on my hand.

625
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,060
Look, by holding it I'm pressing it on my hand.

626
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,900
I can't let this delicacy go to waste.

627
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,260
I'll eat it while pressing it on my hand.
That won't slow us down.

628
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,820
Do all you women like ignoring advice?

629
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,300
Are you talking about Shen Qing?

630
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,980
It seems I have no secrets around you.

631
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,100
It's not it.

632
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,060
Actually, the only other woman close to you

633
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,260
that I know, is Shen Qing.

634
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,660
Actually, if there's something you want to say,
just say it.

635
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,980
Everyone's been able to see

636
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060
that you've been unhappy lately.

637
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,020
It's like a dark cloud hanging over the office.

638
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,500
There are a lot of things that,

639
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,260
when you say them out loud, they make people unhappy.

640
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,700
So, why should I say them out loud?

641
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,540
That depends on what it is.

642
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,780
If it were me,

643
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,100
I'd rather know the truth

644
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,980
than be kept in the dark.

645
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,100
If you don't expect such bad results,

646
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,460
everything will turn out for the best in the end.

647
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,220
If things don't turn out for the best,

648
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,580
it means they're unfinished.

649
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
How did you know what I was going to say?

650
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,820
What?

651
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,020
Nothing. Let's go.

652
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,180
Hold this.

653
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,020
Another day without any surprises.

654
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,300
Time to clock off and go home.

655
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,740
Xia Ke!

656
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
What are you doing here?

657
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,620
Isn't Momo supposed to be picking me up today?

658
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,580
I bribed her.

659
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,980
How's your mom been recently?

660
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,940
Xia Ke,

661
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,020
aren't you and my mom good friends?

662
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,660
You two shouldn't fight.

663
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,100
Look at my dad, he and my mom have made up.

664
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,660
Do you like your dad?

665
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,220
I didn't really like him at first.

666
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,580
But, once he came to kindergarten,

667
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,900
none of the other kids laughed at me anymore.

668
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,900
So, I'll let him be my dad for now.

669
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,660
The addresses of these old customers

670
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,900
will be arranged according to district.

671
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,020
Once these orders are organized,

672
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,500
it'll make it more convenient to use.

673
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,100
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

674
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,260
It's nothing.

675
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
I'm one of your old customers myself.

676
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
More than just an old customer,

677
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,380
you're Xiaoxi's dad.

678
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
You're basically our boss.

679
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,820
Don't talk nonsense.

680
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,820
We're here.

681
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,580
Come on.

682
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,860
Go back and tell your mom

683
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,940
that, tomorrow night at seven o'clock,

684
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,660
I'll be waiting for her at the restaurant she likes.

685
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,140
Why don't you tell her yourself?

686
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,900
Because, she's blocked me.

687
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,700
I can't contact her.

688
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Got it.

689
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,060
When Tiantian and Xiaowen from my class fight,

690
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,540
they don't talk to each other either

691
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,140
and make me send messages for them.

692
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,060
Say it again for me.

693
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,340
Xia Ke invites my mom to dinner
tomorrow night at seven o'clock

694
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,300
at the restaurant she likes.

695
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,340
OK. Turn around.

696
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,060
Off you go.

697
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,860
OK.

698
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,380
Mom!

699
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,140
Mom!

700
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,780
Xiaoxi!

701
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,500
I bought you an Octonauts toy!

702
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,620
Do you like it?

703
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,460
Yeah.

704
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,940
Where's mom?

705
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,460
Come here.

706
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,180
Mom went to deliver a cake.

707
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,180
Wait a moment,

708
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,060
I want to ask you a question.

709
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,580
Come here.

710
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,180
Just now, what was Xia Ke

711
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,420
saying to you?

712
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
He and mom have fallen out,

713
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,060
so he wants me to tell mom

714
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,340
that he's invited her to dinner tomorrow night.

715
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,220
Xiaoxi.

716
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,100
What?

717
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,620
After you get out of kindergarten tomorrow,

718
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,700
how about I take you to the amusement park?

719
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,380
Amusement park!

720
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:05,860
Ah!

721
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,140
What is it?

722
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,500
Mom said I can't go out with you alone.

723
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,620
How about this?

724
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,660
What?

725
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,220
Tomorrow, Xia Ke

726
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,660
wants to make up with mom, right?

727
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,980
Right, he does.

728
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,660
But, mom and we

729
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,700
will go to the amusement park tomorrow.

730
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,380
Yeah.

731
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,260
Can you let Xia Ke wait a day

732
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,420
to make up with your mom?

733
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,300
Let me think.

734
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,740
The amusement park is so fun.

735
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,780
Of course I can.

736
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,580
OK, then let's swear on it.

737
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,380
Scout's honor!

738
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,100
Go and play.

739
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:52,820
OK.

740
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,820
Mom!

741
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,380
Mom!

742
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,460
Mom!

743
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,260
Mom!

744
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,780
Let's play on that one later.

745
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:01,900
OK.

746
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,580
The tall one.

747
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:29,940
Mom,

748
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,500
you and Xia Ke can make up tomorrow.

749
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,660
Xiaoxi, what are you saying?

750
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,340
You were supposed to make up today,

751
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,540
but we went to the amusement park.

752
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,540
(Xia Ke)

753
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,860
Why didn't you confirm it?

754
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,340
I forgot.

755
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,060
Next time...

756
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,860
You're planning on a next time?

757
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,460
No, no.

758
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,660
It'll never happen again.

759
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,340
Do you know that success and failure can come down
to the little things?

760
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,820
Can you use your brain?

761
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,300
Where's Xing Yun? Why is she still not coming?

762
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,660
What's going on in there?

763
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,940
Have you ever seen the horror movie,

764
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,980
"And Then There Were None"?

765
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,020
That's what's going on in there.

766
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,060
She's back.

767
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,140
Why are you only arriving now, you brat?

768
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:19,460
What's wrong?

769
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,260
I'm not interested in any explanations.

770
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,900
What's in here?

771
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,100
Something that's about to prove useful.

772
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,060
Why does the whole house smell like medicine?

773
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,260
What are you doing?

774
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,660
Licorice, plum juice, and chrysanthemum tea.

775
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,340
They all counteract internal heat.

776
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,180
I bought them online.

777
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,740
What's wrong with you?

778
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,100
Hello? Send Amy in here.

779
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,340
Mr. Xia, you wanted to see me?

780
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,580
What is this?

781
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,860
Xing Yun sent you this.

782
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,820
She said the weather's hot and you need something
to counteract internal heat.

783
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,580
That's too fattening. Eat this.

784
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,060
What?

785
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,780
Xing Yun, no entry.

786
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,980
His words?

787
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,500
He said you're not allowed

788
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,020
to set foot in his office today.

789
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,340
It looks like that medicine was a bit heavy-handed.

790
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,540
What? How could he be so ungrateful?

791
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,420
I crawled out of bed at 5 a.m.

792
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,740
to get that ready for him.

793
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,260
Is it funny?

794
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,100
So, how have things been going at your bank?

795
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,980
Not great, lately.

796
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,100
So few people want to borrow money these days.

797
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,020
Our shares might drop a couple points.

798
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,420
That Ling Shan you wanted me to look into,

799
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,500
what's your relationship with him?

800
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,820
None.

801
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,380
Good.

802
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,260
You're going to want to stay away from him.

803
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,220
What do you mean?

804
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,580
This guy borrowed

805
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,700
some money from our bank's Guangzhou branch.

806
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,340
He's already half a year overdue.

807
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,180
How much did he borrow?

808
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,260
15 million.

809
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,660
This is a non-performing loan.

810
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,660
It's got my colleagues in Guangzhou worried sick.
