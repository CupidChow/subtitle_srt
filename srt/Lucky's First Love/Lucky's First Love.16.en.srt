1
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,550
=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,630
=Episode 16=

3
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
You began to doubt the life.

4
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,830
We can't say it is a coincidence now.

5
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
With Dongdong's character,

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,670
how could he park his car

7
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
two miles away after he got a new vehicle?

8
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah.

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,670
If there is nothing fishy,

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
he would have bragged this all over the world.

11
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,880
And that car is so expensive,

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,750
he couldn't afford even with a loan.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,390
But you know what,

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
it is just some guess and speculation,

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
and we don't have actual evidence.

16
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,160
What should we do next?

17
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,800
Have a meal!

18
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,800
Mr. Xia, is this some kind of revenge

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,910
for the "Anti-grumpy" meal
I prepared for you last time?

20
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,190
I thought you were quite grumpy too.

21
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,630
Then you don't know much about women.

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,360
When women are in bad mood,

23
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,190
they still need the food to comfort.

24
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,240
At least let's get a fish.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Waiter, menu please.

26
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,670
What is the most expensive fish?

27
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,520
A Boston lobster, please.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,960
And a king crab.

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,520
OK.

30
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,470
Mr. Xia,

31
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,360
you are too generous.

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,440
Are you feeling better now?

33
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,550
I'm not used to this now.

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,600
I don't think you are the Mr. Xia I know.

35
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,190
In your mind,

36
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,080
am I really stingy?

37
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,720
No.

38
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,960
What I mean is

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,000
I think you have changed a lot recently.

40
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,630
Not as cold as before.

41
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,320
You are more amiable.

42
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,240
Perhaps what have been changed
is not the people

43
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,720
but the relationship between them.

44
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,640
Hello, mom.

45
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,160
Yun, He Yu came here for you.

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
When will you come back?

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,790
What is he doing here?

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,550
I am still busy.

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
Well, I'll tell him.

50
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,110
Okay, I know.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,390
Mr. Xia, where did we just talk?

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
It's nothing.

53
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,510
He Yu, Yun said she wouldn’t

54
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,270
be able to come back soon.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,720
That's okay.

56
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,110
Please give these cartoons to her.

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,550
She can kill some time at least.

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,350
That's very thoughtful. Thank you.

59
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,640
No, it's alright.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,390
My pleasure.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,480
I don't know what happened to Yun recently.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
She always goes out really early

63
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,640
and comes home very late.

64
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,760
But she is in a good mood.

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,390
Thank you guys who really helped her out.

66
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,070
It's okay. That's what we should do.

67
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,160
I gotta go now.

68
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,950
Why don't you take a seat?

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,760
No, I am good.

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,320
Alright.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Well, thank you.

72
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you.

73
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,640
I am heading back now.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,510
Mr. Xia, drive safely.

75
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,200
Why don't you leave?

76
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,230
You got to prepare

77
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,390
going back to work recently.

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
We will discuss other things

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,790
after we solve this problem.

80
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,110
What other things?

81
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,040
Go home.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
See you, Mr. Xia.

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,830
Hello?

84
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,070
Do you know where I am?

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,270
I'm downstairs at Xing Yun's house.

86
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,720
Sorry, I couldn't follow that.

87
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,440
I don't know.

88
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,390
After all these days,

89
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,760
it's the first time I saw a big smile on her face.

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,230
Did you call me to show off your relationship?

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,480
The opposite.

92
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,110
I just don't want to be sad alone.

93
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,000
Her smile was not for me.

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
You must know who it's for.

95
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,670
You have the time

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,920
to be so emotional here.

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,390
Why don't you use this time to do something serious?

98
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,950
Like what?

99
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,390
For example, you can contact

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,550
one of your ex-girlfriends
who is working at the airport

101
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,480
and check the whereabouts of the Lin Jing.

102
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,920
Xing Yun.

103
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,480
We have found the most suspected person
who might leak the instance.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,920
I also have a suspect target.

105
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,550
We don't suspect the same person, do we?

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,760
Have any of you seen Director Wang?

107
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,480
Why are you looking for him?

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,270
Not me. Yiyi is looking for him.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,640
She is so bossy now

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,600
and she even asks the director to meet her.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,640
I think

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
she must have figured out something,

113
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,230
but she doesn't want to alert the traitor.

114
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,110
That's why she wanna meet them at the cafe.

115
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,350
Yeah. How about this? Yiyi really

116
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,070
made a big deal of that tarot card yesterday.

117
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,790
Do you think that will work?

118
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
I think it will.

119
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,000
I wonder who leaked it.

120
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,720
Are you looking for someone?

121
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,830
Buy a coffee.

122
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,200
Are you from TIG?

123
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,030
Yeah.

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,710
Someone is expecting you.

125
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,230
Me?

126
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
Hello, Xing Yun.

127
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,590
Long time no see.

128
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,280
I came here for coffee.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
I still have many things to do.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,000
I gotta leave now.

131
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,670
Don't leave, we have waited for you for a long time.

132
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,840
Wait. What do you mean?

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,840
Dongdong, we already know

134
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,440
you are the one who leaked the instance.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,150
I advise you to admit it

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
so you can beg for mercy from the company.

137
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,150
Yiyi, are you trying to

138
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,030
slander me with some piece of paper?

139
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,440
I know you and Xing Yun are best friends.

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,350
But you can't make me a scapegoat

141
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,470
to prove she is innocent.

142
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,030
How dare you say you are the scapegoat.

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,550
If you are not guilty,

144
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,320
why did you keep searching things like

145
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,960
"How to find the traitor with Tarot"?

146
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me make this clear for you.

147
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,550
As Yiyi played the tarot cards for everyone,

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
and I am very curious,

149
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,200
what's the matter that I searched that?

150
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,880
If you're just curious,

151
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,840
why do you come here today?

152
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,110
I don't know what you're talking about.

153
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,640
I am very busy, please don't waste my time.

154
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,080
Don't go.

155
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,280
What are you doing?

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Dongdong, we are such good friends.

157
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,910
You bought a car.

158
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,440
Why don't you take me for a ride?

159
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,150
This is not cool.

160
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,110
You even said we are besties!

161
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,760
I remember you said

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,000
you are sharing the house with your colleagues.

163
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,670
In the 4S store,

164
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,840
you could not leave your home address,

165
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,080
so you left the company's address.

166
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,590
You're Dabai, aren't you?

167
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,030
Check me?

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,910
Good.

169
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,880
Then I will tell you the truth.

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,150
I bought a car. So what?

171
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,670
I am very low-key.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,110
I haven't had time to tell you yet.

173
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,080
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,670
How about the license plate?
How are you qualified to buy a car?

175
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,030
I borrowed it from my friends. Why?

176
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,550
How do you have the money to afford a car?

177
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,910
It's none of your business.

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,080
Not my business?

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,230
This is related to the innocence of Xing Yun.

180
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,320
Why isn't it our business?

181
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,520
(Mr. Xia)

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,470
Hello, Mr. Xia.

183
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,880
The three of us are together.

184
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,470
Now?

185
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,400
Everyone.

186
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,320
Okay, I see.

187
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,960
Mr. Xia let us go upstairs now,

188
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,520
including you.

189
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
I warn you.

190
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,470
There is no actual evidence in your hands.

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,110
It is best not to slander people casually.

192
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,150
Get out of my way.

193
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,910
Mr. Xia is so annoying.

194
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,640
He chose the worst timing to call.

195
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,030
We almost tricked him to admit that.

196
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,440
All right, Yiyi. Let's see what Mr. Xia will say.

197
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,320
Let's go up first.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Xing Yun, let's go.

199
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,640
Hurry up.

200
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,960
Mr. Xia, I asked Amy and Yiyi to come downstairs.

201
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,230
It seems that you are really quite free today.

202
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,230
Help me to fix the car.

203
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,710
I just bumped into a car by accident.

204
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,000
Mr. Xia, it is not the time to say this now.

205
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,400
I may not be clear enough.

206
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
What I just hit was a

207
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,080
a brand-new grey Mercedes.

208
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,280
I called the insurance company.

209
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,710
The strange thing is that

210
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,320
the car owner and the insured

211
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
are not the same.

212
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,150
I am not surprised that you are the owner.

213
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,670
But it is weird that

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,080
the insured is the cousin of Mr. Yang

215
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,910
who is the general manager of Huize Game.

216
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,080
I did a further investigation.

217
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,000
The actual purchaser of this car is actually...

218
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,320
Mr. Xia, stop.

219
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,440
I was wrong.

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,590
Call the police.

221
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,710
(Meeting room)

222
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,640
Dongdong is suspected of disclosing trade secrets

223
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,000
and has been taken away by the police.

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
And TIG

225
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,200
will officially sue Huize Game.

226
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,550
That's it?

227
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,350
What about Xing Yun and her college classmates?

228
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,230
Doesn't that Lin Jing

229
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,110
disappear

230
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
after this revealed?

231
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,840
This is just a coincidence.

232
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,400
Since you brought up that Lin Jing met Xing Yun

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
it successfully distracted everyone's attention.

234
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,000
They took the opportunity
and sent Lin Jing away with an excuse,

235
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,710
which transferred the suspicion of Dongdong.

236
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,030
If it weren't someone who had a rough conclusion

237
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,080
because of some rumors,

238
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,440
it won't give them the chance to take this opportunity.

239
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,400
As for Lin Jing, please wait a moment.

240
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,320
Are you Miss Lin?

241
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,350
I found your flight

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,590
has landed an hour ago.

243
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,470
Get in the car.

244
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,590
Who are you?

245
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,320
I am Yao Qing from Jiawo

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,520
the partner of TIG.

247
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,400
I am also a friend of Xing Yun.

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,150
Hello, everyone. I'm Lin Jing.

249
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,880
I am also the secretary of the general manager
from Huize Games.

250
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,710
Xing Yun and I are college classmates

251
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,790
and good friends too.

252
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,000
Hello, Miss Lin.

253
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
Tell me about it.

254
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,440
Why did you disappear a few days ago?

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
My boss suddenly gave me a holiday.

256
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,910
Let me prepare for the wedding.

257
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
So I went to Hong Kong, China.

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,590
Did you talk to Xing Yun about the game?

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,350
I really just ask Xing Yun

260
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,000
to help design my wedding invitation card.

261
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,790
There are other college classmates

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,150
who can prove this.

263
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,840
Although this is the story,

264
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,230
Xing Yun still has an unshirkable responsibility

265
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,760
for this instance leak.

266
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,710
She is in charge of the project.

267
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,670
According to your words,

268
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,280
the first person to blame for

269
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,640
should be the boss myself.

270
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Mr. Sun, I am here to apologize for that.

271
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
What I care the most now

272
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,200
is not your apology

273
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,670
but how to move forward

274
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,960
the progress of this instance project.

275
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,000
I think before we talk about the project,

276
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,640
some people still owe an apology.

277
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,520
Because of his stupidity,

278
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,640
he let an inspiring and passionate employee

279
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,590
be treated unfairly and feel disheartened.

280
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,230
This is a big loss not only for the project

281
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,320
but also for the company.

282
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Don't you think so, Mr. Xia?

283
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,520
Amy, let Xing Yun come in.

284
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,910
Okay.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,790
Lin Jing.

286
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Mr. Duan.

287
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,880
Mr. He, I hope you understand

288
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,590
we are Party A.

289
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,440
Some people think that

290
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,590
it will lose his face
if the boss apologizes to his subordinates.

291
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,550
But that's not true.

292
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,230
Prestige will not be established from dictatorship,

293
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,710
but from the responsibility

294
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,320
and solving the problem effectively.

295
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,000
Mr. Duan.

296
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,230
Mr. Sun.

297
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,960
You'd better apologize to Xing Yun now.

298
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,840
After all you wronged her.

299
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,590
Wait, Mr. Sun.

300
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,320
You deserve this apology.

302
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,550
You should accept it.

303
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,470
Mr. Duan, I accept your apology.

304
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
But I hope that from now on

305
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,230
you won't mistreat others.

306
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,960
Not everyone's passion

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
can stand such a blow.

308
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,470
I am leaving now.

309
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,590
Xing Yun, I am really sorry.

310
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,790
I didn't expect this

311
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,910
will become so serious.

312
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,910
It doesn't matter. It's all over now.

313
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,590
Besides, we are the same.

314
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,910
We both are scapegoats, aren't we?

315
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,320
No, you don't know.

316
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,520
In fact, after you looked for me

317
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,910
my boss gave me a holiday.

318
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,350
He also told me that

319
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,200
I should never contact with people
from your company.

320
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I didn't expect that

321
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,710
he will shift the blame on you.

322
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,230
You come to our company to tell the truth.

323
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Won't your boss be hard on you?

324
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,440
He is now

325
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,230
waiting for your company's lawyer letter.

326
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,200
He has no time for me.

327
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,590
When I get married,

328
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,400
I am ready to quit
and become a full-time housewife.

329
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,320
My husband is the boss

330
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
of my last company.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
We have office romance.

332
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,550
Really?

333
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Let me tell you.

334
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,280
This kind of long-term love is the best.

335
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,150
Two people were unconsciously

336
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,230
getting closer.

337
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,520
When they realize,

338
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
it's already really intimate.

339
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,110
By the way, you know

340
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,830
who also came to our company for me?

341
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,830
I know. He Yu.

342
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,310
No, it's Mr. Xia.

343
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,160
Look, my colleague secretly took this picture.

344
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,230
Your boss is really nice.

345
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,830
He would run around

346
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,000
for the innocence of an ordinary employee like you.

347
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,110
No wonder your company has developed so well.

348
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,560
It is 70% off.

349
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,190
Where?

350
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,830
Isn't it?

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,470
Where?

352
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Go, go, go.

353
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,560
Again?

354
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,680
70% off.

355
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,590
Over there.

356
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Okay, let's go there.

357
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,520
I can't stand with flat shoes.

358
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,280
High heels are really...

359
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,160
We buy too much.

360
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,230
This is how you celebrate?

361
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,800
Of course.

362
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,950
When a woman's mood  is very good or bad,

363
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,310
she will do a big shopping.

364
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,830
I don't think she is a woman at all.

365
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,590
Otherwise, why is she so distant

366
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,920
in front of the passionate chase

367
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,950
of Mr. He?

368
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
Right. Mr. He is so good to you.

369
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,640
At the meeting,

370
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,280
he made Mr. Duan speechless.

371
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,040
And the grand love confession ceremony before.

372
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,470
The fireworks were all over the sky. How romantic!

373
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
After I know him longer,

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,110
I think he is not bad.

375
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,760
But I just don't like it.

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,070
Why don't you like him?

377
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,830
He is charming and good to you.

378
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
He is willing to change for you.

379
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,350
You really don't like him?

380
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,680
What a waste, Xing Yun.

381
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,830
But I also think Mr. Xia is quite good.

382
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Think about it.

383
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,680
He had to deal with so much business
during the day,

384
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
and he had to stay up late
to investigate the truth in the company at night.

385
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Yeah.

386
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,310
I trust you.

387
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,590
I think you have changed a lot recently.

388
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,640
Not as cold as before.

389
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,310
Perhaps what have changed is not people

390
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,230
but the relationship between them.

391
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,230
If it weren't for this thing,

392
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,880
we wouldn't be able to see

393
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,350
the messy look of Mr. Xia.

394
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,680
All right.

395
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,230
How would Xing Yun have feelings for Mr. Xia?

396
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,800
Mr. Xia was really hard on her.

397
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,070
Who do you choose, Mr. He and Mr. Xia?

398
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,190
Who do you choose?

399
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,760
We are asking you.

400
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,710
I just remember that I need go to 4S store today

401
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,470
and pick up Mr. Xia's car.

402
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,520
His car has just been repaired today.

403
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,230
I'll go first.

404
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,950
You...

405
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,710
So... Does that mean she chooses Mr. Xia?

406
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,910
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

407
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,430
He Yu.

408
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,280
Is it a surprise?

409
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,230
I was the first to arrive today.

410
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,680
I am here to inform you

411
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,040
that they will not come to the meeting today.

412
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,560
What does that mean?

413
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Since there was something wrong
with TIG's project before,

414
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,000
Director Qian has our team

415
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
transferred to other projects.

416
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,160
Mr. He hasn't finished work yet?

417
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
You designed this? Pretty good.

418
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,190
Mr. He is very mature this time.

419
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
I thought you were going to fight Director Qian

420
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,230
three hundred rounds.

421
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,710
He will only waste my time.

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,710
Besides,

423
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,190
he still left me

424
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,190
a talented person like you.

425
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,190
You want me to do this with you?

426
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,680
I am very expensive.

427
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,190
What do you mean?

428
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,160
It's not for me.

429
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
This is for TIG.

430
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,680
All right.

431
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,590
Who would spend a night with a woman like you?

432
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,350
You become so indifferent after one night.

433
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,950
Pay attention to what you say.

434
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,710
Get up and change your clothes at home.

435
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,590
Why are you worried about this?

436
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,230
You want the whole company to see

437
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
that we are like this?

438
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,350
No, it doesn't matter.

439
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,190
Even it has any gossip between you and me,

440
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,640
the worst situation will be that I give up my career

441
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,830
for you like Mr. Xia.

442
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,190
I can just quit.

443
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,190
You tell me.

444
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,640
Is it because Mr. Xia quit his job for you

445
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,310
that you become so loyal?

446
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,040
You'd better not let me hear that

447
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,350
your name and my name

448
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,520
are put together.

449
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,000
Yao Qing.

450
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,560
Thank you.

451
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,710
I declare Xing Yun is back to her work now.

452
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,590
She will continue to be responsible
for the instance project.

453
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,590
Hope everyone can cooperate with her.

454
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,070
I also wish our project will be successful.

455
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,880
Good.

456
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,880
Your things

457
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,760
have been put

458
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
on the desk by Amy.

459
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,800
You can organize it.

460
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,400
You can come to me if you need.

461
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Thanks, Director Wang.

462
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,070
Congratulations.

463
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,350
Xing Yun, let me buy you a coffee.

464
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,640
Thank you.

465
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,160
Xing Yun, let's have lunch together.

466
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,710
Good.

467
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,230
Let's talk then.

468
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,230
Xing Yun.

469
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,040
Pack up your things. Here are two boxes.

470
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,280
What is this?

471
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,590
What's this? Is this from you, Yiyi?

472
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,400
I don't know.

473
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,110
What?

474
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
This is...

475
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,190
Luffy!

476
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,520
This is that limited edition one.

477
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Yes! You can't buy it now.

478
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
(Gift for coming back)

479
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,070
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

480
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,110
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

481
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,760
Mom, Dad, I am full.

482
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,400
Gonna leave.

483
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,230
Wait, wait, wait.

484
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,190
come on.

485
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,400
Take this with you.

486
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,430
What is it? For me?

487
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,470
It's not for you.

488
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
It's for Mr. Xia.

489
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,520
For him? Why?

490
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,680
What is this?

491
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,350
I know he is rich

492
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,190
and has eaten all the delicious food.

493
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,470
Isn't he living alone now?

494
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
He must seldom cook things.

495
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,880
I got a secret recipe from my friend.

496
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,160
I tried today.

497
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,400
You see, it's delicious.

498
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,520
You want Mr. Xia to chew chicken feet...

499
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,190
Hey.

500
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,560
The real good food is hidden in

501
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,430
the kitchen of ordinary people. Right?

502
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,560
You know what, Yun.

503
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,680
To make this pot of chicken claws,

504
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,680
your mom has got up since three o'clock.

505
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,950
You should thank her.

506
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,350
All right, I will take it.

507
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,310
Mom, go get some sleep now.

508
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,470
You have panda eyes now.

509
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,520
Okay.

510
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,880
Thank you mom.

511
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,070
Bye-bye.

512
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,070
Mom and Dad, I'm leaving now.

513
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,400
Bye bye.

514
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,680
Be careful.

515
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,680
What will we have for lunch?

516
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,950
You guys go.

517
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,310
I still have something unfinished at hand.

518
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
You work so hard after you came back.

519
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,110
Do you want us to pack some food for you?

520
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,070
It's up to you.

521
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,280
Let's go.

522
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,880
I want pineapple bun.

523
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,310
That pineapple bun is not authentic.

524
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,430
If I don't send it,

525
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,110
will my mother's kindness be in vain?

526
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,800
I'll put it on his table when no one is around.

527
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,230
Mr. Xia, I think you should seriously

528
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,520
consider my proposal.

529
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,070
If it is about Xing Yun,

530
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,920
we don't need to discuss it.

531
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,430
There is another thing you don't know, Mr. Xia.

532
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,160
Mr. Sun has signed another two contracts.

533
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,880
He is already overwhelmed.

534
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,280
So he has put me fully

535
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,280
in charge of TIG's work.

536
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,350
I know.

537
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,190
You know.

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
So you should not

539
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,110
reject my proposal.

540
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,400
I have already checked all your personnel
of this project

541
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,520
in advance.

542
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
People like Xing Yun

543
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,070
don't have talent or experience.

544
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,760
In this leak scandal,

545
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,280
she is the person in charge

546
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,560
but unable to find problems in time.

547
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,470
Let everyone's achievements be in vain.

548
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,680
This kind of person is worse than a sand in my eyes.

549
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,160
Don't talk about cooperation.

550
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,710
Her existence is already a hidden danger to me.

551
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
TIG personnel transfer

552
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,350
doesn't need to bother Mr. Duan.

553
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,190
Obviously he is seeking his own profit
in public affairs.

554
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,920
Do they think Mr. Xia will agree?

555
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,160
How wouldn't he?

556
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,640
If he doesn't, there will be no investment.

557
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,400
How does a company run without investment funds?

558
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,680
Mom, you shouldn't have made chicken claws.

559
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,350
You should make spicy squid.

560
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,550
(Reply at once)

561
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,190
Is he gonna tell me the truth so early now?

562
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,880
Hello, Mr. Xia?

563
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,350
What are you doing here?

564
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh, god, so spicy.

565
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,950
Do you want one?

566
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
What would you like to eat to comfort yourself?

567
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,880
No matter what kind of decision you make,

568
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,920
I can understand.

569
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
Just let you order.

570
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,430
Is it so serious?

571
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,280
Let's have two meal sets.

572
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,110
Okay, just a moment, please.

573
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,110
What do you want from me?

574
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,470
Have lunch with me.

575
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,760
Just lunch?

576
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,830
You want something else?

577
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,470
Thank you.

578
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,350
There was something I wanted to tell you.

579
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,680
But I don't think today is the right time.

580
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,400
Does he want to fire me but he can't say it?

581
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,830
You just go back to work.

582
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,230
How are you getting along
with the progress of the project?

583
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,710
You are in charge.

584
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,230
You should be familiar with these
as soon as possible.

585
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,830
Mr. Xia, the progress of this project
has been delayed.

586
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,190
Does this make our investors unhappy?

587
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,350
Will it affect the company's operation

588
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,310
and investment funds?

589
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,280
You don't wanna be in charge of the instance

590
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
but you wanna be a director now?

591
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,000
Just eat, don't worry.

592
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,880
I am in charge of the company.

593
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,830
This restaurant is really delicious.

594
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,590
It's better than my imagination...

595
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,590
Am I crazy?

596
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
Isn't that Xing Yun and Mr. Xia?

597
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,040
Oh, my God.

598
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,760
Xing Yun told us that she had work to do.

599
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,350
It turns out she is having secret lunch
with Mr. Xia.

600
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,070
No.

601
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,680
Isn't it normal for Xing Yun and Mr. Xia
to eat together?

602
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,190
Why didn't she tell us?

603
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,560
There must be some secret.

604
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,430
Mysterious, it is a juicy gossip!

605
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,000
I am gonna ask her later when I come back.

606
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,040
No, no, no.

607
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,880
We'd better pretend nothing happened.

608
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,710
Why?

609
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,070
It is still the start of their office romance,

610
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,880
which is already very sensitive and fragile.

611
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,310
Besides, she is seeing Mr. Xia.

612
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,710
We just

613
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,280
wait when she makes her mind

614
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,560
and tells us by herself.

615
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,560
Let's go.

616
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
I wanna see more.

617
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,830
Don't move. I'll just watch.

618
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,640
Let's go.

619
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,950
Xu Yiyi, let me go.

620
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,710
The investment is delayed two weeks

621
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
that the scheduled date.

622
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,310
We are in a passive position.

623
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,920
Is there any problem with salary?

624
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,230
At the beginning of the year,
we decided to operate independently.

625
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,710
The operator that owns us a large sum of money

626
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,920
didn't come back yet.

627
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,560
And this month we just signed

628
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,880
a new lease with the building.

629
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,710
So this month's salary...

630
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,280
In this way, you can comfort everyone first.

631
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,560
Give me a few days.

632
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,000
Good.

633
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,640
This place still needs to be adjusted like this.

634
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,350
You still have to consider the light source

635
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,310
and light and shade factors.

636
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,350
You guys should learn more from Xing Yun.

637
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
This draft has been revised for several times.

638
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,000
We don't wanna be slow

639
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,520
but our equipment is not good enough.

640
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,710
Didn't they say by this month

641
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,710
we will have the professional version of Wacom Cintiq?

642
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,160
That's the secret weapon in the drawing world.

643
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
It will certainly get twice the result
with half the effort.

644
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,110
You want to use the secret weapon,

645
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
you should be capable of being a master.

646
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,000
You're used to tablets

647
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,950
and it might not be easy to use the digital screen.

648
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,800
Xing Yun.

649
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,280
I think that you don't show favouritism to

650
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,000
our art group after you became the planner.

651
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,520
You only think about how to save money for boss.

652
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,560
I heard that

653
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,680
the next investment has not been paid yet.

654
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,470
And you even want to change the equipment?

655
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,560
Yes.

656
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,760
Recently, Mr. Xia seldom shows up in the company.

657
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,230
Is there something happened to our company?

658
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,950
Don't overthink.

659
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,830
What can it happen?

660
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,280
Not right.

661
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,400
Today is the pay day.

662
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,190
It's almost time to leave work now.

663
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
We didn't get anything yet.

664
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,040
Told you nothing would have happened.

665
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,800
Isn't it coming over?

666
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,880
Every colleague from TIG,

667
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,430
the bank of our company's account

668
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,230
is upgrading the online banking system

669
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,520
and suspends the business of payroll processing

670
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
so the salary of this month

671
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,310
will be delayed by one week.

672
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,000
This has never happened before.

673
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,350
Xing Yun, you really don't know this.

674
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,560
This game company spends money like water.

675
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,800
If the capital chain is really broken,

676
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,400
we really have to pray for ourselves now.

677
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,640
Just order this? It's not like you guys.

678
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,280
Salary delay.

679
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,230
What do I afford

680
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,590
the sea urchin from Hokkaido.

681
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,400
Hello. I'd like to pay this month's bill

682
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,680
on installments.

683
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,430
Twelve months.

684
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,000
Thank you.

685
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Don't do this, guys.

686
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Maybe there is just something wrong
with the banking system.

687
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,560
It is just temporary.

688
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,560
When did Mr. Xia make us disappointed?

689
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,870
I don't believe what others say.

690
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,560
But if you say so,

691
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,910
it proves it should be okay, right?

692
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,800
Exactly.

693
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,120
And Xing Yun and Mr. Xia

694
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,150
have a  good relationship.

695
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,520
I'm gonna ask you again.

696
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,000
Is there really a solution?

697
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,230
In fact, I know how to solve

698
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,120
the investment fund problem.

699
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,760
That is...

700
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,430
I knew it.

701
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Mr. Xia won't hide from you.

702
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
That's great. It's good to know.

703
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,150
Waiters, menu please.

704
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,600
I want menu too.

705
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,910
I need one more sea urchin.

706
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,120
Another Wagyu Beef.

707
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,320
What else?

708
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:47,910
Trepang.

709
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,870
Yes, yes, yes.

710
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,520
Forget it. I'll treat you today.

711
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,630
Is there any other fancy food?

712
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,430
Really? Your treat?

713
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,520
If it's your treat,

714
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,390
we are gonna think about adding...

715
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,040
People like Xing Yun

716
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,600
don't have a talent or experience.

717
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,710
This kind of person is worse
than a grain of sand in my eyes.

718
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,280
Don't talk about cooperation,

719
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,800
her existence is already a hidden danger to me.

720
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,670
TIG personnel transfer

721
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,040
doesn't need to bother Mr. Duan.

722
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,710
When can TIG receive the next

723
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,470
investment fund?

724
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,910
Do I need to bother that?

725
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,870
Are you threatening me?

726
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,760
I am helping you.

727
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,470
After all we both hope that

728
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,910
the project can proceed smoothly.

729
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,280
This game company spends money like water.

730
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,430
If the capital chain is really broken...

731
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,800
Mr. Xia I always hope you can seriously

732
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,950
consider my proposal.

733
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,350
(Resignation Letter)

734
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,350
(President's Office)

735
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,350
(Resignation Letter)

736
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,550
(Resignation Letter)

737
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,080
What does that mean?

738
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,230
Literal meaning.

739
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,430
I want to quit.

740
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,230
You don't have to persuade me.

741
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,040
I am just tired of staying at the same place.

742
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,150
I want to change an environment.

743
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,360
It has nothing to do with you or the company.

744
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,860
(Leader's signature)

745
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,280
I promise I will make the handover
as soon as possible.

746
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,760
I will not delay the progress of work.

747
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,470
If you copy your resignation letter
from the internet,

748
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,470
at least change your signature.

749
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,040
Sorry, I'll change it now.

750
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,630
Stop.

751
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,000
No need to change.

752
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,190
I won't agree the resignation

753
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,950
that is not sincere.

754
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,360
Mr. Xia, I'm not kidding.

755
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,760
I'm not kidding either.

756
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,600
I don't know what you think,

757
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,760
I also don't know who told you this.

758
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,670
But there is no need for you
to worry about this.

759
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,470
You don't have to.

760
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,040
Mr. Xia, Mr. Duan is here.

761
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,800
You keep this in mind.

762
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,600
I will handle everything no matter what.

763
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,800
Go out.

764
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,670
Jiawo is asking for the advertisement money.

765
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,910
(Meeting room)

766
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,800
Mr. Xia, I am a person

767
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,320
who is extremely cautious in business.

768
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,040
Before the investment is paid,

769
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,870
I have specially arranged our company's staff

770
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,120
to make an evaluation of your revised plan.

771
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,120
Do you mind?

772
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,230
Whatever.

773
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,630
What assessment?

774
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,230
It is just deliberately delaying the time.

775
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,000
That's why the lackeys are even more difficult
to deal with.

776
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,040
Let's begin.

777
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,280
Let's look at the progress
of the instance plan first.

778
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,600
First of all, I would like
to report the current progress.

779
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,150
Wait a minute.

780
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,320
Sorry.

781
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,560
This font size

782
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,190
is really uncomfortable to read.

783
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,360
Sorry, I'll change it.

784
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,630
About the adventure module,

785
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,150
we will focus on
revising the incentive mechanism.

786
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,040
Stop, stop, stop.

787
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,230
I think this part is completely
lack of data support.

788
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,910
And your tone is too flat.

789
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,360
We have no interest at all.

790
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,320
Can you add some emotion to it?

791
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,150
He is deliberately against Xing Yun.

792
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,390
It's not speech... What emotion?

793
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Since Mr. Duan has so much dissatisfaction,

794
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,120
then we will revise it until you are happy.

795
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,840
During the developing process of Infinite instance,

796
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,120
we have conducted a data survey.

797
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,800
Including geographic demographics,

798
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,360
behavior statistics and operation statistics.

799
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,120
Mr. Xia is really good.

800
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Mr. Duan, are you satisfied now?

801
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,430
I think it is very good.

802
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
Personally I am concerned

803
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,040
about this plan.

804
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,670
But I just doubt

805
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,080
that such a small slide

806
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,190
needs the boss to change it himself.

807
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,430
What if the boss has a helm,

808
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
whose hand will it fall into by the end?

809
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,190
Mr. Xia,

810
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,710
you and I both hope that the project can proceed smoothly.

811
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,670
So about my proposal,

812
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
you'd better think it over.

813
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,950
I don't think this is necessary.

814
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Then we still need

815
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,000
time to evaluate the investment funds.

816
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,520
Mr. Duan is really a paunch.

817
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,950
But if he has been so difficult for us,

818
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,600
when can we get this investment fund?

819
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,000
Today, there are two more colleagues
from the program department

820
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,230
who submitted resignation letters.

821
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,800
I am the only person he wants to embarrass.

822
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,600
This...

823
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't look.

824
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,870
Tell me about the market situation in this region.

825
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,360
Good.

826
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,190
If we wanna do a good job
in the promotion of this project,

827
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,870
there must be a judgment
on the prospect at first.

828
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,470
And for our project,

829
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,600
we should find its customers
and direction correctly.

830
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,200
(Yun)

831
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,230
Mr. Xia, why are you here?

832
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,040
Let's talk about it.

833
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,600
No need.

834
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,670
Why are you so naive?

835
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,630
Is it meaningful for you to do such thing?

836
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,910
I just don't want to do it anymore.

837
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,710
Why don't you just agree?

838
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,560
I said it.

839
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,520
I will solve the company's problems.

840
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,190
It's none of your business.

841
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,520
But...

842
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,560
But you can't solve it.

843
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,120
Because I am the reason she wanna quit.

844
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,910
Just tell him straight.

845
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,800
There is nothing to be shy.

846
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,190
If you don't tell him clearly,

847
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,560
how can he agree to your resignation?

848
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,800
We are already together.

849
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,800
I don't want my girlfriend to work so hard.

850
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,870
Besides,

851
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,390
in the future our companies

852
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,430
will continue to cooperate.

853
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,670
She should also keep a distance.

854
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,600
So I just let her quit.

855
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,560
Didn't you say you have refused him?

856
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,000
Bro, you know me.

857
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,430
I will never give up on her.

858
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,840
Who can ignore my passion?

859
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,080
So the reason you quit is because of him.

860
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,120
Mr. Xia.

861
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,950
Okay.

862
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,000
Thank you for taking my girlfriend home.

863
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,630
We have a date tonight.

864
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,600
See you.

865
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,520
We'll get together next time.

866
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,150
Bye-bye.

867
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,600
Doesn't your joke have any limits?

868
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,870
How can you tell him that I am dating you?

869
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
What do you want to do?

870
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,560
What? I am helping you to quit.

871
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
I didn't ask for your help.

872
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,120
Don't you just want to sacrifice for the company?

873
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,390
But think about it,

874
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,910
how could Xia Ke let you do that?

875
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Without me,

876
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,670
you will never be able to quit.

877
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,710
But what are we gonna do after this?

878
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,840
We are clearly not together.

879
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,120
That's it.

880
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,760
Since we have already told this lie,

881
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,520
we should get prepared.

882
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,910
Let me remind you,

883
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,430
that guy is not so easy to fool.

884
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,430
Before you leave the company,

885
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,080
we have to play the couple.

886
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,430
How?

887
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,470
(Meeting room)

888
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,320
At the end of the meeting,

889
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,230
I'd like to announce a personnel change with you.

890
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,120
Since Xing Yun quit her job,

891
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,630
Yiyi will be the person in charge of

892
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,470
the instance project.

893
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:34,870
Time is really tight.

894
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,760
I hope you two

895
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,910
can finish the task handover within two days.

896
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,280
Of course, there are other departments
of our company

897
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,670
which also need to continue to cooperate them.

898
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,670
Quit?

899
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,390
Why does Xing Yun quit? She was doing well.

900
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,560
Is it because of the leak?

901
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,630
She is innocent.

902
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,150
She has put a lot of efforts

903
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,080
on this project.

904
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,190
We all know that.

905
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,840
What exactly is going on, Xing Yun?

906
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,150
Please say something.

907
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,630
There are no problems.

908
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,120
Xing Yun.

909
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,470
Dismiss.

910
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,760
Are you kidding?

911
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,320
Are you dating Mr. He?

912
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,190
No way. Didn't you choose Mr. Xia?

913
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,190
Stop talking nonsense.

914
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,470
Anyway, this is it.

915
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,280
My quit has nothing to do with the company.

916
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,910
Just personal reason.

917
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,800
I don't believe.

918
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,520
Didn't you say that you don't like him?

919
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,190
Everyone will change.

920
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,320
When did you start?

921
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,950
Even if you are with him,

922
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,000
you don't have to quit.

923
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,150
Your best friends will definitely ask you

924
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,470
how we fell in love.

925
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,760
You have to answer carefully,

926
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,150
because if they know you are lying,

927
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,190
then Mr. Xia will know you are lying too.

928
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,520
What should I say?

929
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,280
You just tell them

930
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,950
when you were suspended,

931
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,120
we always hung out together
and started having feeling for each other.

932
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,670
The reason that you quit

933
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,600
is to marry me as a full-time housewife .

934
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,560
Who will marry you?

935
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,000
The happier you pretend,

936
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,840
the more likely they are blinded by this thing

937
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,800
then they will ignore the loopholes in this lie.

938
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,320
I trust you.

939
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,080
When I was suspended,

940
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,230
he came to accompany me every day.

941
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,600
Later, I gradually found out

942
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,360
I can't leave him any more.

943
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,430
In fact, it is quite nice

944
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,040
to be a full-time housewife like Lin Jing

945
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,320
No work pressure.

946
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,190
There is freedom and time.

947
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,600
I can have a wonderful life.

948
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,080
Alright.

949
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,670
You guys are ready to settle down now.

950
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,800
Okay.

951
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,360
Mr. He has both money and time.

952
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,120
Marrying him is  a good choice.

953
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,080
Although our little group

954
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,760
will be separated soon,

955
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,520
it is still a happy thing

956
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,520
that you find your true love.

957
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,320
Bless you. Cheers.
