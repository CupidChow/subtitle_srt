00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,550
=Episode 10=

3
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,910
Mike. I'm so sorry.

4
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,800
I just get off a plane.

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,030
I'll definitely give you

6
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,030
a reasonable explanation.

7
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,270
Hello! Mike.

8
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,830
This is He Yu.

9
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,800
I said that it's all my fault.

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,190
It's useless to bother Yao Qing.

11
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,600
Okay.

12
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,320
I promise you I'll definitely solve it for you.

13
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,880
Bye bye!

14
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,750
Long time no see.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,390
Just in a cafe

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,440
I heard the staff in a flower shop gossiped

17
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,520
that the famous playboy

18
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,520
in our building

19
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,470
ordered a large bunch of flowers for someone.

20
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,240
It seems that no matter what happens

21
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,800
it can't stop you from falling in love.

22
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,190
Career and love are two different things.

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,520
They are independent from each other.

24
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,440
I thought that you would be absent
from this meeting today.

25
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,830
I'll go to work in the next 3 days.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,720
It's boring to badger.

27
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,800
The cooling period after confession of love

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
is the most critical.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
You just showed your love to her

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,830
but disappeared from her life.

31
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,190
She fails to contact you.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,000
When she wants to give up,

33
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,960
you appear again.

34
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,270
If you spend more time on work,

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,720
everything will be fine.

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,670
Without my making a mess,

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,880
you have no chance to get in contact with Xia Ke.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,390
How's your trip with Xia Ke in Shanghai?

39
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,090
(Jiawo Media Advertising company)

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,440
I came to Liu Shunyu's studio

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,910
with my best attitude.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,030
They were really touched.

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,600
So they decided to withdraw the lawsuit
and solve it privately.

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,240
I've seen the plan for compensation.

45
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
It's kind of reasonable.

46
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,360
5 million RMB as compensation.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,670
You think it is reasonable?

48
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't worry.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,910
It's just a preliminary plan.
We need further discussion.

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,630
Director Qian, anything can be solved by money

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,670
is not a problem.

52
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,440
He Yu, how could you be like this?

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,270
Let me tell you.

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,030
Don't bring your beauish style

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,910
to work.

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,470
I heard that Liu Shunyu likes

57
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,030
Zach Brook's painting the most.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,550
Zach Brook?

59
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,270
He died the year before last.

60
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,720
So the price of his paintings keeps soaring.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,360
Among his famous paintings, Four Seasons,

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,470
only the painting of Winter

63
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,910
is auctioned by a domestic painting lover.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
Other paintings are still beyond seas.

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,160
If my memory serves me well,

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,390
the Winter

67
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,830
is hung in your living room.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,110
No way. I like it very much.

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,110
Please give up to the one who like it better.

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
He Yu, let me tell you.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,670
You must deal with this matter nicely.

72
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,350
Understand?

73
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,230
Give me a satisfactory answer within a week.

74
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,200
About TIG case,

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,830
I don't know how you

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,110
confuse Xia Ke.

77
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,880
Anyway, he insists on

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
ending our cooperation

79
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,160
if I change the project manager.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,390
I wanna seize this chance to have a good rest.

81
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,350
What should I do?

82
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,320
Don't be too proud of it.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,070
Let me tell you.

84
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,440
The headquarter attaches great importance
to this case.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,920
Yao Qing is specially dispatched from Shanghai

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,070
to deal with this case with you.

87
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,480
Three of you are familiar with each other.

88
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,000
Great!

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,110
He Yu.

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,110
How could you still laugh?!

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,070
It's all your fault.

92
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,160
So they dispatch Yao Qing from Shanghai.

93
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,880
What are you waiting for?!

94
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,320
Go to work!

95
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,230
She must be so grateful to me.

96
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,600
Sorry, forget it.

97
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,880
Xiaoxi, let's play football.

98
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,230
Wow, it's amazing.

99
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,000
Who is this uncle?

100
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,720
Dad!

101
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,640
Come here.

102
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,790
Football.

103
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,510
What did you call me?

104
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,510
Dad!

105
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,110
Good boy! Let's go.

106
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,350
Mom!

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,070
Dad plays football very well.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,440
Xiaoxi, from now on dad will take you
to play football, OK?

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,320
Great!

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,230
Mom, he plays very well.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,320
Xiaopang and Xiaopan are so surprised.

112
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,670
He was the captain of the football team in college.

113
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,440
Really?

114
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,110
Of course.

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,270
At that time

116
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
your mother often cheered for me

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,920
next to the field.

118
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,160
Why do you come here today?

119
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,040
Actually I often come here to see Xiaoxi.

120
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,200
He has outdoor classes every Tuesday and Thursday.

121
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,440
He also has interest class today.

122
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,390
Sorry.

123
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,790
I really wanna see him.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,510
I want to find a chance to

125
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,920
make up for him

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,600
as a father.

127
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,000
I wanna accompany him to grow up every day.

128
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,920
I don't want to miss it anymore.

129
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I want to give you a present.

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,390
Don't refuse me.

131
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,950
It's about an artist whose name starts with Z.

132
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,830
Fine, it's really my fault.

133
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,350
When you're available,

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,440
let's have a face-to-face chat.

135
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,670
Still discuss about work after work?

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,390
How do you know that he likes Zach Brook?

137
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,670
If you put your thoughts on girls

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,790
to him,

139
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,350
you'll know more.

140
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,790
More?

141
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
You'll find that

142
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,670
his current girlfriend is your ex-girlfriend.

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,510
Who is she?

144
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,390
I don't know.

145
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,600
It should be the one
who broke up with you in discord.

146
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,950
Otherwise he won't stare at your release

147
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,070
even you're not authorized.

148
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,600
Lisa?

149
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,950
Xiaoshan?

150
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
You should be grateful.

151
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,760
He loves painting more

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,230
than his girlfriend.

153
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,000
How do you go home? I can send you away.

154
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,160
No need. I take the taxi.

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,550
Here comes the taxi.

156
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,040
Bye bye!

157
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,510
Fifteen! Fifteen! Fifteen!

158
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,320
Fifteen! Twenty! Fifteen!

159
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,760
You lose. Drink it.

160
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,390
Finally you're punished.

161
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,790
He Yu.

162
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,600
You look in a bad state today.

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,350
Why do I think such debauched life

164
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
is so boring overnight?

165
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,480
What did you say?

166
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,270
Excuse my absence.

167
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,640
Where are you going?

168
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,200
Help yourself.

169
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,200
Let's play something different.

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,110
What is this?

171
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,710
He Yu. Are you insane?

172
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,760
Tell me about the cartoon you like to watch.

173
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
Only classic cartoons.

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,760
Take one if that sounds good.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,640
Really?

176
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,000
Cartoon.

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,960
I watched Doraemon.

178
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,710
That counts.

179
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,440
I know. I know.

180
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
I watched One Piece.

181
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,280
That is a famous one.

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I also know one.

183
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,840
Chi-bi Maruko from Japan.

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,670
It is well-known.

185
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,400
I also know that.

186
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,440
It's been 5 days?

187
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,550
The flowers are delivered more timely
than our punching in.

188
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,470
I think Mr. He is serious.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
But what does Mr. Xia mean?

190
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,150
All of these flowers have been sent
to his office.

191
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,250
(Reply at once)

192
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,760
Hello, Mr. Xia.

193
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
OK, I'll go.

194
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,230
You're even afraid of wasting time on going to stool.

195
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,910
Rest no more than 10 minutes.

196
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,230
You'll be called back.

197
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,000
This is the purpose of Mr. Xia.

198
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,080
He is playing a trick of having himself
tortured to win your service.

199
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,350
You even dare not to complain.

200
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,350
Don't you tell Mr. He

201
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,670
not to trap you anymore?

202
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,670
If Mr. Xia doesn't ask me to ignore him,

203
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,590
I would have thrown these flowers to Jiawo.

204
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,880
I gotta go.

205
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,030
Here! Coffee.

206
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,000
Be careful not to spill on my comics.

207
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,840
Should I read it from left to right

208
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,000
or from right to left?

209
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,030
Don't tell me. I love guess.

210
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,280
This female otaku is so difficult to chase?

211
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,840
You need learn it from scratch.

212
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,790
Difficult?

213
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
This is the most interesting

214
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,200
part in a relationship.

215
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,400
What difficult is not now

216
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,590
but to keep being together

217
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
without boredom.

218
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,710
You'd better keep together

219
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,000
with my comics.

220
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,590
(New Wechat Message)

221
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,080
(New Wechat Message)
It's so quick to react?

222
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,470
(Message has been sent but got rejected)

223
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,840
(Message has been sent but got rejected)
Interesting.

224
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,880
(Message has been sent but got rejected)

225
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,280
(Message has been sent but got rejected)
It's so interesting.

226
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,110
Mr. He.

227
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,400
Where's my Lucky?

228
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,590
She is supposed to report her job to Mr. Xia.

229
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,550
Wait a minute. I haven't noticed Mr. Xia.

230
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,000
Mr. He, you've come at the right time.

231
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,710
We just talk about the first draft of the program.

232
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,760
When do you finish it?

233
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,030
You know me.

234
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,520
I'll submit it as long as I'm in a good mood.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,230
What a good weather today!

236
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,670
So you should be in a good mood?

237
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,200
If you are defriended,

238
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,110
will you be in a good mood?

239
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,640
Much less to see my carefully-selected flowers

240
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,320
being sent to a man's room.

241
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,470
I feel even worse.

242
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,400
Xing Yun.

243
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
You can go back.

244
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,880
Don't go.

245
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,470
Haven't you played enough?

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm so happy.

247
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,590
I got it.

248
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,640
She is your mascot.

249
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,230
She really has no freedom to love.

250
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,840
No matter what happens between

251
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,790
me and your staff,

252
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,640
we should report to you in advance?

253
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,760
Even ask for your opinion?

254
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,080
What you're doing with my employee at my company

255
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
should be reported to me.

256
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,350
So is that okay if we go out?

257
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,590
During these days

258
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,790
you give me great support

259
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,880
on my life and work.

260
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,710
I have to repay you with delicacy.

261
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,230
What support I give you?

262
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,200
Maybe I'll be happy after a meal.

263
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,790
Mr. Xia.

264
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,710
If you don't agree,

265
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,150
I have to doubt that you

266
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,400
have other private intent.

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,080
Go ahead! Take care of Manager He.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
So that he can submit a

269
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
perfect advertising solution.

270
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,080
Let's go!

271
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,590
What would you like to eat?

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,470
Shall we go to the next-door fast food restaurant?

273
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,640
I have a meeting this afternoon.

274
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,520
The steak here is especially delicious.

275
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,520
You have to taste it.

276
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,110
Noodle is fine.

277
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,080
Which one would you like?

278
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,520
We have tomato pasta, seafood pasta

279
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,550
and cuttlefish pasta.

280
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,470
I want the fastest and cheapest.

281
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,320
Thank you.

282
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,110
Alright. Please wait.

283
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,230
You are really interesting.

284
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,550
This is a western restaurant.

285
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,910
You just count it as a food stall.

286
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,030
Mr. He, let's come to the point.

287
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,030
That day...

288
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,400
I was serious that day.

289
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm very serious

290
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,640
to have lunch with you.

291
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,760
Lucky, I really like you.

292
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,670
You're the first girl
who makes me want to settle down.

293
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,000
You settle down?

294
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,670
In fact, there are many ways to chase girls.

295
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,880
Mystery is the key.

296
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,520
My customary routine

297
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,910
is to send unnamed flowers
after the confession of love

298
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,790
to make the girl be curious.

299
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,350
Make her confuse.

300
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,960
According to her reaction,

301
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,350
I can take the next action.

302
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,670
Why do you say that to me?

303
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,350
Only you

304
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
make me abandon all love tactics.

305
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't you think you can

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,640
put off the first draft by this way?

307
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,110
I won't give you a chance

308
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,230
to misunderstand my sincerity.

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,080
Cindy, sent the first draft
to Miss. Xing from TIG.

310
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
(Cindy from Jiawo: First Draft. doc)

311
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't be surprised.

312
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,590
I have prepared

313
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,150
for a long-term operation.

314
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,280
Long term?

315
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,960
I always believe in talent and fate.

316
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,910
If I fail to chase a girl in 3 days,
I'll change another one.

317
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,080
Taking things as they are

318
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,230
is the meaning of my name.

319
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,400
But you

320
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,470
make me wonder

321
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,080
the possibility beyond destiny.

322
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,110
There's no need.

323
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,350
I can tell you now.

324
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
I watch comics during my leisure time.

325
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,030
and I work overtime in my spare time,

326
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,230
My life is just so boring.

327
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm totally different from you guys

328
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,840
who like outdoor sport

329
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,230
and elegant art.

330
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,110
Go on.

331
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,440
Go on.

332
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,200
Let me know more about you.

333
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,000
Go ahead.

334
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,790
Go ahead.

335
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,230
When can I have the meal?

336
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,960
Sir, have you decided to order?

337
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,760
You...

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,670
Are you full?

339
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,800
Waiter, pay the bill.

340
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,110
It's on my treat.

341
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,880
Foolish.

342
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,310
How can I let a girl to pay for a meal?

343
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,350
Mr. Xia asked me to take care of you.

344
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,310
He said you are our important partner.

345
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,920
It's a private meal between us.

346
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
We can't abuse public funds.

347
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,310
How much?

348
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,110
Your order has been paid

349
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,470
by Miss Susan.

350
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,110
She said she would not come to greet you.

351
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,280
She also said

352
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
wish you and

353
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,560
your 29th girlfriend happy dinner.

354
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
And...

355
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,880
And what?

356
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,430
She asked you go to her home

357
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,040
to get

358
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,640
your forgotten underwear.

359
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,110
Mr. He, you have 28 ex-girlfriends?

360
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,710
Are you in an old age with a young face,

361
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,880
or do you change girlfriends too frequently?

362
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,830
It's more interesting.

363
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Say thanks to Miss Susan for me.

364
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,800
Tell her

365
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll definitely take it back when I'm available.

366
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,380
(Yun)

367
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,080
(Yun)

368
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,710
I pay you.

369
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,110
So help me keep watch on your master.

370
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,280
Is Lucky coming?

371
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,920
Xing Yun and Mr. Xia went out for a meeting.

372
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm afraid that they won't be back today.

373
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,920
Mr. He, aren't you

374
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,710
too tired to come here every day?

375
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,710
How about I send you a message

376
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,880
when Xing Yun arrives next time?

377
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,310
My god. Where is she?

378
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,640
Mr. Xia is holding a meeting in a cafe

379
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,800
with the instance group.

380
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,830
I'm afraid that they won't come back today.

381
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,350
You hold a meeting outside now.

382
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,830
This is because of you.

383
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,280
It seems that Xing Yun and Mr. Xia

384
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,110
are very busy recently.

385
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Xing Yun.

386
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,160
Have you seen the list of test analysis?

387
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,760
(Mr. He asked where you are. I didn't tell him.)
Yes, I analyzed it.

388
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,230
Two-thirds of them are system bugs.

389
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,950
I asked the programmer last night.

390
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,710
He said that 80% can be repaired quickly.

391
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,830
But the main problem is

392
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,280
the small module of Dating Adventure.

393
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,800
The scoring experience is not so satisfied.

394
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,470
So I invite Yiyi and Dongdong here.

395
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,160
They're responsible for

396
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,830
the main line planning.

397
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,880
Right.

398
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,110
The instance of this part is so poor.

399
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,280
The dating content is outdated.

400
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,000
This adventure lacks of enough feeling of freshness.

401
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,070
Although it has playability,

402
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,110
the immersion is not satisfied.

403
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,560
Right. Boss,

404
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,040
the inside game scenes

405
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,110
are a little bit vulgar.

406
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,800
Watching movies and drinking coffee.

407
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,350
Even a schoolchild knows these tricks.

408
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,160
Who wanna play it?!

409
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
So I think we can find some

410
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,950
new dating venues and gameplays.

411
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
We can give some feedbacks
to real life through it.

412
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,800
Good idea! We can implant some real places.

413
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,350
Here are top 10 hottest

414
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,830
dating sites in our city.

415
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,520
I went to the first two sites with Yiyi.
We gained a lot.

416
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,920
(There's rumor saying I love you. But it's not.)
But the top 3 are really too hard to order.

417
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
So we are looking for

418
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,070
other user experience feedback on the internet

419
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,640
and take them as reference.

420
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,230
Mr. Xia, what do you think?

421
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,470
Say it again.

422
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,000
Mr. Xia, shall we rest for 10 minutes?

423
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,040
Great!

424
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,230
Let's take a break.

425
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
Finally we can rest. Yes.

426
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,230
Let's go! Take a break.

427
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,230
Would you like a cup of coffee? Mr. Xia.

428
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,430
Has He Yu contacted you recently?

429
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,310
I unfriend  him on WeChat.

430
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,070
He called me a few times, but I didn't answer.

431
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,070
But Mr. Xia, I think you were wrong.

432
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,560
It's been a few days.

433
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,430
He doesn't give up.

434
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,350
Well? Haven't you been chased?

435
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,280
You wanna be his girlfriend?

436
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,230
How could that be?!

437
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,950
Do you know how many girlfriends he had?

438
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,640
How many?

439
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,000
28!

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,470
It can form 3 football teams.

441
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,350
Even he maintains each relationship for 6 months,

442
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,800
it will cost him 14 years
to rotate these girlfriends.

443
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,590
6 months?

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,520
Let me tell you.

445
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,710
He Yu only spends 3 days to chase a girl.

446
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,590
If he can keep a relationship with a girl for 2 days,

447
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,880
who knows how long this relationship
will be after that?

448
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
That depends on his conscientiousness.

449
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,710
He chases me more than 3 days. What does that mean?

450
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,710
It means you think too much.

451
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,400
If the Instance Zone project is postponed,

452
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,110
get ready to resign.

453
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,070
Hello?

454
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,680
Still sleeping?

455
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,230
Don't hang up. I have proper business.

456
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,640
What's it?

457
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,590
I have a meeting with customers this afternoon.

458
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,520
But my notebook was left in TIG yesterday.

459
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,710
Today is Saturday!

460
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,310
So I can't get in now.

461
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
Can you come over?

462
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,520
Open the door with your access card.

463
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm at the gate of TIG.

464
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
You left USB last time. This time is your notebook.

465
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,640
Could you hang your important items

466
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,190
on your neck?

467
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,070
So sorry to bother you on the weekend.

468
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,110
I planned to express it to you.

469
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,000
But I'm afraid that you'll do something bad
with my access card.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
It's valuable for me to sleep late.

471
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,190
What?

472
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,310
Have a meeting on weekends?

473
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,560
There is no such unkind customers!

474
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,070
Do you...

475
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,520
You're cheated.

476
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,430
Since you are here,

477
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,040
why don't you see what I prepare for you?

478
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,470
I'm not interested. I wanna go home to sleep.

479
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,760
Is there a problem with the small module
of the Instance Zone?

480
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,110
As the first 3 of the dating sites,

481
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,070
it's really hard to make an appointment

482
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,430
to make pizza with that Italian master.

483
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,070
Limited time and limited people.

484
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Before the master came here 3 months ago,

485
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,520
the number of appointment is used up.

486
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,640
As long as I take up,

487
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,070
I'll definitely make it.

488
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,430
Make a pizza with a handsome guy

489
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,800
at lunch time.

490
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,040
It sounds so fascinating to a girl.

491
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,680
Do you think it's useful to the Instance Zone?

492
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
How do you know that?

493
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,040
I use a limited handbags to exchange
the last information of the project.

494
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,310
Is it worth?

495
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,680
I suddenly want to eat some sweet.

496
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,560
I also want to meet you.

497
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,520
Are you going out?

498
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I'm going to visit a customer.

499
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,950
Where is Xiaoxi?

500
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,640
He was just picked up by Xia Ke.

501
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,110
Xia Ke?

502
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,520
It's been a long time since I saw him last time.

503
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,000
You still blame him?

504
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,760
Let me send you there.

505
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,230
Let's go!

506
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,110
Pizza is eaten by hand in Italy.

507
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:30,430
It's best to match mozzarella cheese

508
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,350
and San Marzano tomato.

509
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,310
Pizza is just a snack.

510
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,800
People usually eat it by hand.

511
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
It can be used for social contact

512
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,230
instead of a food to satisfy one's hunger
in the eyes of Americans.

513
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Mozzarella is the best choice.

514
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,400
It's best to choose San Marzano Tomatoes.

515
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,680
Really? You can understand it?

516
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,520
Are you kidding me?

517
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Italian focus

518
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,830
on enjoying the pizza stuffing.

519
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,920
So the crust must be thin.

520
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,920
A sophisticated pizza master

521
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,680
can put a layer of soup

522
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,950
between the crust and stuffing.

523
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,590
Shame on wasting food for you.

524
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,230
Well, Planner Xing, you tell me

525
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,880
what is the most romantic now?

526
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,310
The most romantic thing I can think of

527
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,350
is to never see you again forever,

528
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,470
never ever.

529
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,040
In order to make a delicious pizza,

530
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,310
we need the wood

531
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,040
which can be burnt to 380 degrees.

532
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,710
Is it cherry wood?

533
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,110
You are right.

534
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,430
It's also possible to use beech.

535
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,560
Xia Ke, is the pizza more delicious than

536
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,470
that my mother made?

537
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,590
Why don't you have a try?

538
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,830
Good afternoon.

539
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,590
Let me introduce for you.

540
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,070
We're the best pizza restaurant in Fangcheng City.

541
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,640
Because of our activity, Learn to Make Pizza,

542
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,920
we are selected as the top 10 dating sites.

543
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,230
Wait for me for a while.

544
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,400
The most authentic pizza in Italy is Margaret.

545
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,430
There are tomato, basil

546
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,760
and mozzarella cheese in it.

547
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,350
They just form the specialty in Italy.

548
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,040
It was dedicated to the Queen
and named after the Queen.

549
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,710
Xing Yun, do you know that?

550
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,950
Margherita with red wine

551
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,590
can highlight Margherita’s soft taste

552
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,920
and bring out the aroma of basil.

553
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,310
Personally I prefer red...

554
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,190
Mr. Xia?

555
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,520
Why are you here?

556
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,070
Don't you say that you don't accept him?

557
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,280
What're you doing?

558
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,680
You misunderstood me.

559
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,070
I am experiencing for the Instance Zone.

560
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,230
This is the number two popular restaurant online.

561
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,800
I haven't made an appointment.

562
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,280
Why are we running?

563
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,430
We haven't chosen any pizza yet!

564
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,760
What's the number one?

565
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,400
What is the number one?

566
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,310
Didn't you tell me that this is the number two?

567
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,760
You are Mr. Xia? Hello!

568
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,800
Parent-child time is very precious.

569
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,880
Our backyard is very beautiful.

570
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,950
After dining,

571
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,350
you can bring your kid to have fun there.

572
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,190
Oh, no, you mistook...

573
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,920
My wife always wants to taste your delicacies.

574
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,230
I'm only available today.

575
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,830
Sorry to bother you.

576
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,800
You two are really sweet.

577
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,520
Well,

578
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Mr. Xia, we will meet

579
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,230
all that you need.

580
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,880
Please take a break inside.

581
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,000
The food will be ready right away.

582
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,040
Wow, cats.

583
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,880
There's another one here.

584
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,230
Mr. Xia, you are so great.

585
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,470
This place only serves one table a day.

586
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,000
The appointment has been made
after 6 months later.

587
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,680
You'd better record all of your feeling

588
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,800
without an error

589
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,950
in order to modify the dating module.

590
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,470
Why do we have to pretend a couple?

591
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,520
Is there such a rule?

592
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,310
Of course we must pretend a couple.

593
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,560
So we can have a good feeling.

594
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Have you ever seen that those single person

595
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
have a good taste of dishes?

596
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,350
You're right.

597
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,430
But I didn't expect that

598
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,920
the boss here is such kind of person.

599
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,110
I always thought he is a gentle scholar.

600
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,070
Record your feelings right now.

601
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,880
Thank you.

602
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,760
Go ahead.

603
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,590
This restaurant is famous for its taste.

604
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,430
Delicious?

605
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,350
Yummy! It's so amazing.

606
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,760
It's the most delicious food I have eaten.

607
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,950
Record carefully.

608
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
The fish is also delicious.

609
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,800
It's beautiful. No wonder it is number one.

610
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,310
Is it romantic enough?

611
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,350
No wonder your dating Instance Zone

612
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,310
is so terrible.

613
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,430
Do you keep

614
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,350
many dating sites in secret?

615
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,350
The project is in hot haste.

616
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,110
It's time for you to speak it out.

617
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,430
It depends on my mood.

618
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,230
You are a quick learner.

619
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,680
What did you say?

620
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,070
No, no, no. I just feel that

621
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,800
this restaurant is so great.

622
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,430
Show me what you recorded.

623
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,680
Here.

624
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,680
The homely dishes in this restaurant

625
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,000
are cooked so carefully.

626
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,590
It gives me a feeling that

627
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,760
the commonplace can be

628
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,830
taken good care of.

629
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,520
By the way, when you

630
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,110
eat up a dish,

631
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,560
you can see the words printed on the plate.

632
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,190
It makes me really touched.

633
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,640
Our life is to explore the essence of love

634
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,160
behind trifles, isn't it?

635
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,430
What did you see on your plate?

636
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,830
I hope every time I recall,

637
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,680
I won't feel guilty about my life.

638
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,230
This sentence is almost suitable for

639
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,710
every guest who comes here.

640
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,400
So boring you are.

641
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,350
I start to doubt that

642
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,470
the romance you understand
is the real romance or not.

643
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,560
How dare you question me

644
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,400
with your little love experience?

645
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,470
Then what did you see on your plate?

646
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,350
I forgot that.

647
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,400
Mr. Xia, thank you very much.

648
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,400
I am so confident in the module

649
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,280
for dating adventures.

650
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,920
I gotta go.

651
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,420
(He Yu)

652
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,640
Wait a second!

653
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,680
I know everyone He Yu knows.

654
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,160
I also know those guys that he does not know.

655
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
If you want to collect materials, just ask me.

656
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,560
Goodbye, Mr. Xia.

657
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,430
Thanks for your sending me back.

658
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,040
It's too late. You'd better go home quickly.

659
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,760
Shall we have a meal together tomorrow?

660
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,520
What're you doing?

661
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,470
I told you that

662
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
never let me see you again.

663
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,230
What do you mean?

664
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,190
Hit me!

665
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
Even if you beat me to death today,

666
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,110
I will stay with Shen Qing and my son.

667
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,760
I will do as you said.

668
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,230
Enough!

669
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes, I have been asking myself

670
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,710
why he left us without

671
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,800
any news these years.

672
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,400
I should have known it.

673
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,400
Only she can do it.

674
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,920
Did you and she force Ling Shan away,
didn't you?

675
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,640
She is your grandma.

676
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,590
It's really rare
that you can reach a consensus with her.

677
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,680
Do you think we will do bad things to you?

678
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,520
Didn't you?

679
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,560
I just know today

680
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,800
that what I suffered

681
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,600
are not accidents.

682
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,630
It's my grandmother and my brother

683
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,520
did that to me on purpose.

684
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,600
What else did you lie to me?

685
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,670
What did you trap me?

686
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,040
You opposed our marriage.

687
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,800
Is that car accident a part of your plan?

688
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,840
Are you insane?

689
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,760
Mom! Xia Ke.

690
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,000
Don't quarrel.

691
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,520
Dad, your mouth is bleeding.

692
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,280
I am fine.

693
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,630
Xiaoxi, come here.

694
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,710
We should go.

695
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,950
Leave me alone.

696
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,550
(Ling Shan)

697
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,190
Hey.

698
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,600
Shen Qing, I am waiting for you downstairs.

699
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,080
Give me a chance to explain, OK?

700
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,670
Why are you still here?

701
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,630
I know that you always complain that

702
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,080
I didn't tell you all the truth.

703
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,560
Never mind. You are also a victim.

704
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,520
No one can resist

705
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,950
what my grandma decided.

706
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,040
I come to you this time

707
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,950
I already went back on my words.

708
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,760
I don't know what they will do to me.

709
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,120
But for you, I am not afraid.

710
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,190
From the moment I decided
to give birth to Shen Xiaoxi,

711
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,360
I have nothing to do with her.

712
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,190
Do not worry!

713
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,710
She'll do nothing to you.

714
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,710
Shen Qing, in this world,

715
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,950
only you and Xiaoxi are my family.

716
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,280
Promise me. Let me stay with you.

717
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,040
Ling Shan.

718
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,760
It's too late.

719
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,760
Xiaoxi will wake up in tears.

720
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,520
You're back.

721
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,760
What are you doing here?

722
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,120
I come to find Susan to take my underwear.

723
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,670
I don't want to play a trick with you now.

724
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,670
What happened to you?

725
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Ling Shan came back.

726
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,600
Shen Qing's ex-husband?

727
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,760
What are you going to do?

728
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,600
Xiaoxi calls him Daddy.

729
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,840
Shen Qing is a smart woman.

730
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,800
You should believe her.

731
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,150
Forget it! Let's talk about our business.

732
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,870
Lucky…

733
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,560
She dislikes to be called that.

734
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,040
All right!

735
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,600
Miss Xing Yun, you like her?

736
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:25,950
Boring.

737
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,870
If not, why do you go against me?

738
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,360
I just don't want to see her
jumping into a trap

739
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,710
from another one.

740
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,950
It's not the same as before.

741
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,280
I am serious this time.

742
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,800
Does that count as being serious?

743
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,120
You just don't trust my heart.

744
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,760
I never trust

745
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,080
something that never exists.

746
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,710
I want to ask you

747
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,870
do you love her?

748
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,230
If yes, I apologize to you.

749
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Let's have a fair competition.

750
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,670
If not,

751
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,600
I hope you

752
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,670
don't impede us seeking happiness.

753
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,760
You think you will be happy?

754
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,630
Let's wait and see.

755
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,530
(If you want to be loved,
learn to love others first.)

756
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,670
Xing Yun, finally you're coming.

757
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,630
Mr. Xia is quite furious today.

758
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,390
No one survives.

759
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,230
Was he in a good mood yesterday?

760
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,870
Yesterday was Sunday.

761
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,520
Did you see him?

762
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,470
Good morning.

763
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,280
I wonder that if the employees of Jiawo
don't need work.

764
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,280
People like me who rely on the values and talents

765
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,080
are really free.

766
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,040
Then I am different.

767
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,280
I am very busy. Please go back.

768
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,390
Where do I put these flowers?

769
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,950
Where do I put the flowers?

770
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,080
May I put them here.

771
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,710
Up to you.

772
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,520
I forgot to give it to you last time.

773
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,430
Don't you like Omotesando coffee best.

774
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,520
I asked about it.

775
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
They use Ogawa coffee beans

776
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,760
from an old Japanese coffee shop.

777
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,710
I deliberately asked my friends
to bring it from Japan.

778
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,760
Thank you.

779
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
I heard that you also join
the Instance Zone project team.

780
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,150
We will often meet.

781
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,390
This is Amy.

782
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,150
Let her introduce

783
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,390
the primary members of the Instance Zone project team.

784
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,150
I have a meeting later.

785
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,080
Great!

786
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,080
I am still in work, you!

787
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,670
Mr. Xia.

788
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,150
It's strange! Mr. Xia said nothing today.

789
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,320
This is Xing Yun. She is in charge
of our Instance Zone project.

790
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,560
This is Manager Yao from Jiawo.

791
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
She will be responsible for

792
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,870
our project with Manager He.

793
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
Advertising company is different from

794
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,670
our game company.

795
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,840
You're so beautiful.

796
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:27,840
Thank you.

797
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,280
I'm Yao Qing. I wish we can cooperate happily.

798
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,630
I am so handsome. Why don't you praise me?

799
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,600
Is it okay if I communicate with you?

800
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,950
Wanna get rid of me? That's impossible!

801
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,520
I'm still in charge of

802
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,670
the basic solutions.

803
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,170
(Yun)

804
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,190
Will you die if you say nothing?

805
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,320
Can you talk less?

806
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
(Yun)

807
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,040
I want to buy this.

808
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,190
What's wrong?

809
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,000
This lucky cat is very cute.

810
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,230
I don't remember that I stuffed coins into it.

811
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,120
So good?

812
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,710
I will buy one and put it on the table.

813
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,320
It can automatically make money.

814
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,230
So amazing.

815
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,800
(President Office)

816
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,040
Just show me the advertising program

817
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,760
about the Instance Zone of Infinite.

818
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,560
All right!

819
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,760
Xing Yun takes charge in the first draft.

820
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,800
She cooperated with Manager He of Jiawo
to finish it.

821
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,040
We still have a lot of arrangements.

822
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,760
In the following arrangement,

823
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,390
we arrange Tina and Xiaoke

824
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,520
to assist Xing Yun.

825
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,040
Well.

826
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,000
Arrange Tina directly communicate with He Yu.

827
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,600
Okay, I'll do it.

828
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,470
What shall we talk? Go on.

829
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,190
I just received a notice

830
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,320
that Tina will be in charge
of communicating with you.

831
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,760
You can discuss the rest part with Tina.

832
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,710
She is over there.

833
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,080
Just near the stairs.
