=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,520
=Episode 23=

3
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,700
What's wrong with you?

4
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,010
Don't be in a daze there.

5
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,110
Have your dinner.

6
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,420
Hurry up.

7
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,500
Mom,

8
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
if one day,

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,380
you learn from someone that

10
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,320
dad is actually a prince of a country,

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,440
what will you do?

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,610
Who? Your dad?

13
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,050
Me? A prince?

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,930
I'm a prince?

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Stop laughing!

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,720
There can also be secrets between a couple.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,050
Maybe my dad

18
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,540
has a complicated identity.

19
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,660
A prince?

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,080
OK, let me think.

21
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,080
As you say,

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,910
I'm a prince,

23
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,880
so your grandpa is a king, right?

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,050
But he has concealed it from me with the identity
of a primary school teacher

25
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,600
for so many years.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,940
It's too outrageous.

27
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,160
I've also suffered a lot as your wife

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,540
for so many years.

29
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,020
If I'm a prince, I'll be a king in the future,

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,040
so you will be a queen.

31
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
Of course!

32
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,140
What do you want to do?

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,240
Who is that?

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,550
Ignore it.

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,100
We had fallen out with each other,

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,740
so I won't do anything for her.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,220
Here you are.

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,020
(He drank a lot)

39
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,020
(Reply at once)

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,980
Sorry, it's unable to be connected now.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,770
Please redial later.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
I didn't expect that you would come here.

43
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,220
Now that you have proofs,

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
why don't you make him fall from power directly?

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,190
If the enemy is in the sun,
it's good for us.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,080
At least, we can reassure others.

47
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,720
In order to take over
the M Company's acquisition case

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,840
in the voting meeting of shareholders,

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,680
Director Su has tried hard to

50
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
rope in others openly.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Sirui, I haven't thanked you yet.

52
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,380
Sorry. A private party is being held here.

53
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,590
I come to look for someone.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,970
Are you Miss Xing Yun?

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Please go in.

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,490
Miss Zhang had asked us to let you in.

57
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,730
How do you know this thing?

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,670
Mr. Chen is a good friend of my dad.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,090
He was once invited by Director Su

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,210
and he mentioned it by the way,
so I remember it.

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,120
Grandma, I go there for a while.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,780
Xia Ke!

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,430
Why do they kiss?

64
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,710
It's not a fact.

65
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,940
You misunderstand me.

66
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
They didn't kiss just now,

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,220
but now we have kissed.

68
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,210
Isn't she shy to kiss here?

69
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,880
I don't need to be shy

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,940
to kiss my boyfriend.

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,240
I left my cell phone in the car.

72
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,660
Did she mean to do it just now?

73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,540
Whether she meant to do it or not,

74
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,420
I'm very grateful to her,

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,630
because she made me benefit a lot.

76
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,240
However, in this case,

77
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,630
maybe your investment appraisal
will be in vain.

78
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,820
I hear from Amy that its result is not good.

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,400
Will you go back to the Xia Family?

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,980
Grandma.

81
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,180
Madam!

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,380
Madam!

83
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,230
Excuse me. Excuse me.

84
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,610
Grandma!

85
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,860
Call an ambulance here now.
Madam falls in a faint.

86
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm in Sugar Hotel.

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,660
Ambulance!

88
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,670
Grandma!

89
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,900
They leave.

90
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,490
What is

91
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,500
the result on earth?

92
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,690
Who don't Group Leader Zhang and Mr. Xia

93
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,570
come here these two days?

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,040
I have an ominous presentiment.

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,090
Don't you watch the news?

96
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
Mr. Xia is the young master of Tomorrow Group.

97
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,160
The chairman is in a coma.

98
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,220
Maybe he goes back
to take over his family business.

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,690
The work of the appraisal group is over.

100
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Thank you for your hard work these days.

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,870
What's more, Mr. Xia has asked
for leave these days

102
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,480
and group sent mails to you,

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,150
so I'll take over his work.

104
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,670
If you have any problem,

105
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,730
you can find me directly.

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,980
I have a document for your review
and approval here. Please check it.

107
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,770
OK. Well

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,020
We all know that Mr. Xia comes
from a rich and powerful family,

109
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,160
but we didn't expect that his family
is so rich and powerful.

110
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,760
Mrs. Xia, do you feel very stressful?

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
It's not the time to joke.

112
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,130
OK, I won't joke.

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
Don't you need to go to the hospital
and take care of her?

114
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,840
He didn't ask me to go there,

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,020
but I think

116
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,000
it should be in a mess there now.

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,450
Just work hard.

118
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,890
Now the most important thing is

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,340
the M Company's acquisition case
in the next week.

120
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,360
By then,

121
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,930
if madam still hasn't woken up,

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,210
it'll be very hard to
stick to the decision-making.

123
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,080
Miss Zhang.

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,420
Mr. An, this is a bunch of flowers
for grandma.

125
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,460
OK.

126
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,060
Thank you.

127
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,070
Why do you come here?

128
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,720
I come to visit grandma.

129
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,520
Miss Zhang, thank you for your care.

130
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
Grandma, you must get better soon.

131
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,780
Xia Ke, be relieved.

132
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,310
I'll absolutely help you.

133
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Come in.

134
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,520
Mom, what's wrong?

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,990
My eyes are itching.

136
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,760
Let me see.

137
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
Stop that.

138
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday,

139
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,210
so I give you these as your dating funds.

140
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,200
Thank you, mom.

141
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,200
But why do you give me two red packets?

142
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,190
You're in love,

143
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,620
so everything must be double

144
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,570
in the future.

145
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
Dad, what are you doing?

146
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,780
Your guess is right.

147
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,220
I'm really...

148
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,340
The king of Bolimiya.

149
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,910
A king.

150
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,820
Now I announce that

151
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,000
I formally transfer

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,650
my majesty

153
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,740
to my princess here.

154
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,180
Girl, your dad and I learn from the news that

155
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,700
Mr. Xia's grandma

156
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,130
is really the boss of Tomorrow Group.

157
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,400
Well,

158
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,530
anyway, we don't care it.

159
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,420
As long as you think he is a prince,

160
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,580
you must be the only princess of...

161
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,820
Bolimiya.

162
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,160
Bolimiya. OK.

163
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,610
The only princess of Bolimiya.

164
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,860
Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad.

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,560
(Reply at once)

166
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,840
Queen.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
Please.

168
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,180
Let's go back.

169
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Make way for me.

170
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,680
Close the door. Close the door.

171
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,120
Hello.

172
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,640
How is grandma?

173
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,610
Her vital signs remain steady,
but she is still in a coma.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
Is there anything I can do for you?

175
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,480
How about this?

176
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
Go to the next-door balcony

177
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,560
to check whether there is a man.

178
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't want to see that

179
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,470
someone peeps at my girlfriend
in my house when I'm out.

180
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,350
Stop joking.

181
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Forget it.

182
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,680
In fact, I'm very tired.

183
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,530
I don't know that

184
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,040
grandma has great working pressure
and is very tired until now.

185
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,220
Her workload is much greater than mine in TIG.

186
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Well, I learn from the Internet that

187
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,410
many people who are in a coma

188
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,700
can be woken up

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,950
by the voices of family members,

190
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,470
so you and Shen Qing

191
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,610
can talk with grandma more.

192
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,870
I see.

193
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,860
I didn't expect that

194
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,820
I would talk with her most

195
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,640
under this circumstance in these years.

196
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Well, let's find a place

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,420
to celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

198
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,170
Will you be free?

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,050
At least, I must spend some time
in dining with you.

200
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,780
I don't want to miss it.

201
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,280
OK.

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,850
Mr. Xia comes.

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,730
Mr. Xia, can you accept

204
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,240
our interview?

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,710
Mr. Xia, now you appear here...

206
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,740
What do you want to do?

207
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,320
Don't stop me.

208
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,170
Mr. Xia.

209
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,060
Our restaurant is closed. Leave here.

210
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,570
Close the door.

211
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,640
Mr. Xia! Mr. Xia!

212
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,220
Mr. Xia!

213
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,200
What can we do?

214
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,740
They will stay here for some time.

215
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,130
If Xing Yun comes later...

216
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,500
Yeah, they are even unfriendly to me.

217
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,630
If they know Xing Yun is your girlfriend,

218
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,760
they won't let her off.

219
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,360
Hello. You have reached there now?

220
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,790
I suddenly become busy, so I'm leaving now.

221
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,820
I see.

222
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,710
It doesn't matter.

223
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,540
In fact, I'm not used to celebrating my birthday.

224
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,130
I'm just one year older than I was.

225
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,400
Sorry.

226
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,110
It doesn't matter.

227
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,330
I just have no chance to

228
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,160
enjoy crawfish cooked by the female shopkeeper.

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,700
How about this? When you're free,

230
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,570
eat it with me for a week, OK?

231
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,670
OK.

232
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,740
Bye.

233
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,160
Please enjoy it.

234
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,930
Thank you, female shopkeeper.

235
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,780
No.

236
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,150
Coming.

237
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,130
Uncle Huang, why are you here?

238
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,840
How do you know I'm here?

239
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,830
Someone ordered a birthday takeaway for you

240
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,480
and said that you may be here,

241
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,630
so I come here.

242
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,900
Xia Ke?

243
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,080
Uncle Huang, you provide

244
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,460
better and better services now.

245
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,580
Look carefully.

246
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,100
It's impossible for us to make them so ugly.

247
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,160
So...

248
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,870
Well,

249
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,120
didn't he rush back for anything urgent?

250
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,230
Yeah, he left at once after finishing shelling them.

251
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,330
They indeed look ugly,

252
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
but his kindness is important.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,330
He asked me to tell you that

254
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,570
you also need to eat on time, even if you're alone.

255
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,200
Take time to enjoy it.

256
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,740
I'm going back.

257
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,880
Thank you, Uncle Huang.

258
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,500
What do you want to do?

259
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,480
Sit here. Sit here. Come on.

260
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,660
Tell us the truth. What did you do last night?

261
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,770
In order to stay with Mr. Xia alone,

262
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,560
you specially refused our birthday party, right?

263
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,170
Yeah.

264
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,190
Tell us

265
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,840
how this arbitrary chairman celebrated your birthday.

266
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,520
I didn't meet him last night.

267
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,410
What? You didn't meet him?

268
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,280
It's Mr. Xia's fault.

269
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,210
A man with high IQ

270
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,220
should have a sense of ritual.

271
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,690
He was very busy,

272
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,860
so he had no time to meet me.

273
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,980
You're right.

274
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,180
Now it's the critical moment that

275
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,260
he strives for rights in Tomorrow Group.

276
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,870
Wait.

277
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,230
After Chairman Fang is hospitalized for coma,

278
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,000
the lover of Xia Ke, the eldest grandson

279
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,140
who is one of the candidates for inheritor is exposed.

280
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,430
The daughter of the Zhang Family, Zhang Sirui

281
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,370
frequently goes to the Xia Family and hospital recently,

282
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,740
which makes us doubt

283
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,160
whether they're passionately in love.

284
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,820
Xing Yun, are you OK?

285
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,750
Call him to ask about it clearly.

286
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,630
No need. I believe him.

287
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,820
Given Mr. Xia's characters,

288
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,870
he will absolutely

289
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,320
remove this untrue news

290
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,490
reported by the darned reporter.

291
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,350
This medium dares slander him,

292
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,370
so it'll absolutely have a miserable ending.

293
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,790
Don't worry.

294
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,860
If the Zhang Family can support Xia Ke,

295
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,900
Xia Ke will have more advantages

296
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,600
in the decision-making power
of M Company's acquisition case

297
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,210
and the group inheritance.

298
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,960
These bored reporters

299
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,600
really desire to stir up trouble.

300
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,140
What do you think?

301
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,120
I'll go to meet two directors at 16:00.

302
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
Both of them are old friends
who work for grandma.

303
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,490
They must support us.

304
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,550
I don't refer to it.

305
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,480
How will you clarify it?

306
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,000
Xia Ke, the doorkeeper says
that Miss Zhang Sirui comes.

307
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,370
Your gossip girlfriend

308
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,210
really comes more punctually
than going to work.

309
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,440
Now that she wants to come here,
just let her come.

310
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm busy, so I'm leaving.

311
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,260
What do you think on earth?

312
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,050
Leave it alone.

313
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,290
The appearance of Zhang Sirui

314
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,440
attracts much attention of the media.

315
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,880
It's also excellent that

316
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,220
others all pay attention to

317
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,840
Xia Ke's tidbits now.

318
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,200
You mean...

319
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,770
It's better than the situation that

320
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,420
they keep watching at the gate of Xing Yun's house
with poor motives.

321
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,670
It turns out that he treats Zhang Sirui
as a shield.

322
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,870
(The daughter of Zhang's Group Zhang Sirui
frequently visits Xia's)

323
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,770
(The daughter of Zhang's Group Zhang Sirui
frequently visits Xia's)

324
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,630
So that's how it is.

325
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,540
Are you working for the cleaner

326
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,920
and missing Mr. Xia by looking at it?

327
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,090
Worms on these plants need to be removed,

328
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,940
and cactus can be only exposed
in the sun in the morning,

329
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,960
but it can't be exposed in the sun after noon.

330
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,000
The cleaner doesn't do well in it.

331
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,880
We don't know whether Mr. Xia can refuse

332
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,970
the lure of power.

333
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,550
Maybe

334
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,450
he won't come back to this office anymore.

335
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,850
If he is such a man,

336
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,240
TIG wouldn't be founded.

337
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,540
Do you really believe him?

338
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,800
You haven't met each other for some days.

339
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,790
How did he explain the previous thing of

340
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,960
Zhang Sirui to you?

341
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
He was always very busy.

342
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,820
He even chatted with me over the phone in a hurry.

343
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,800
I didn't have a chance to ask him about it at all.

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,580
You're so tolerant.

345
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,620
What's this?

346
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,800
He forgot to take this.

347
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,300
(Vitamin capsule)
He forgot to take this.

348
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,600
(Vitamin capsule)

349
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,770
Amy, go to the hospital
and send a document to Mr. Xia.

350
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,130
It requires his signature.

351
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,080
Such a field service

352
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,020
should be left to the one
who needs it more than me.

353
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Me?

354
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,510
You really want to stay here
but not to meet him?

355
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,160
Seize this chance to meet him.

356
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,150
Hurry up. Hurry up.

357
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,970
Let me send it.

358
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,200
Excuse me, who do you want to find?

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,550
I want to meet Xia Ke.

360
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,760
Sorry, we're not notified of it,

361
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,610
so you can't go in.

362
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,810
Which medium are you from?

363
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,090
Me?

364
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,470
No, I'm from TIG.

365
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,020
Members of the Xia Family come!

366
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,660
Take care.

367
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,220
Mr. Xia, excuse me,

368
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,580
does Chairman Fang get better now?

369
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,230
Excuse me, what's the progress of

370
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,030
M Company's acquisition case?

371
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,100
I hear that now you're in love with Miss Zhang.

372
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,540
Do you want to directly fight
against Director Su

373
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,660
with the funds of the Zhang Family?

374
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,940
Why are you here?

375
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,820
Mr. Wang asks you
to sign this document at once.

376
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,800
OK.

377
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,920
And you left this on the office table.

378
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
You work so hard these days.
Be careful not to have a cold.

379
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,270
Who is she?

380
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,890
What's the relationship between them?

381
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,450
If you want to share my woe, just work hard.

382
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,670
Xia... Xia...

383
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,630
It turns out that she is an employee
who secretly loves her boss.

384
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,640
It's not a piece of valuable news.

385
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,580
Let's go.

386
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,280
(Vitamin capsule)

387
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,660
Maybe many reporters

388
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,780
are still moving around her.

389
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,000
It seems that she is a good girl,

390
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,650
but now it's a critical moment.

391
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,900
We would better not involve her

392
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,120
in this thing.

393
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,700
Otherwise, Su will know that

394
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,330
she is your soft spot.

395
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,700
We only have less than two days.

396
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
(Vitamin capsule)

397
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,130
Why is it so bitter?

398
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,910
Her heart is bitterer.

399
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,260
I want to make a cup of espresso
to refresh myself.

400
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,950
Did Mr. Xia explain the misunderstanding to you?

401
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,320
Yeah.

402
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,560
What's your next plan?

403
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,340
I plan to...

404
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,840
I plan to work hard

405
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,250
to avoid any problem

406
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,880
in the instance release.

407
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,220
Miss Yao, are you free tomorrow afternoon?

408
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,990
No.

409
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Don't answer me so quickly.

410
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,840
I haven't told you why I ask it.

411
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,820
You'll have nothing important.

412
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,200
I need to go to three companies
for interviews tomorrow afternoon.

413
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,340
Are you looking for a job?

414
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,060
Yes. I can't sit idle and eat.

415
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,580
Well, with me, you...

416
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,360
Stop.

417
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,300
I don't want to be supported by you.

418
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,840
Let me introduce one to you.

419
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,130
You?

420
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,460
Well,

421
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,320
you always stayed in Shanghai these years,

422
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,440
so I must know here better than you do.

423
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,850
This job must belong to you.

424
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,920
OK.

425
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,480
Tell me how the company

426
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,400
and benefits are.

427
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,100
Transnational corporation. Flextime job.

428
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,250
It's easy and not laborious,

429
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
with abundant holidays and excellent benefits.

430
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
Above all, its boss is handsome and kind-hearted.

431
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,470
I can assure that you won't find anyone

432
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,780
which is more suitable for you anymore.

433
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,800
Why don't you apply for it?

434
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,420
This is a job I specially seek for you.

435
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,030
Are you interested in it?

436
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,520
What's this company?

437
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,940
No job hunters would ask
about the specific situations of the company

438
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,300
at the beginning of applying for a job.

439
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,370
If you're really interested in it,

440
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,580
I'll arrange an interview for you
at 15:00 tomorrow.

441
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,120
It sounds very mysterious.

442
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,600
OK, just believe you.

443
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,760
You promise me?

444
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,240
It's deal.

445
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,280
It's deal.

446
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
Are you Miss Yao?

447
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,440
Hello, are you Luna?

448
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,540
Yes, I am.

449
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,380
You are really beautiful. Mr. He is right.

450
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,940
How about getting started?

451
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,430
Don't we need to wait for Mr. He?

452
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,550
No need. No need to wait for him.

453
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,010
You're so arbitrary,

454
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,680
but it doesn't matter,

455
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,920
if you can make a decision.

456
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,160
Let me make a self-introduction first.

457
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,320
This is my resume.

458
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,430
We indeed need to

459
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,210
have an all-round understanding of you,

460
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,500
but you're too rigorous

461
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,940
to specially bring a resume here.

462
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,570
It should be a basic.

463
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,260
How about this?

464
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,940
Let me introduce the basic information

465
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,160
of our company to you first.

466
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,840
Okay.

467
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,800
Our company is

468
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,270
a professional overseas wedding company,

469
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,810
which provides one-stop wedding services

470
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,380
such as island wedding,

471
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,910
European castle wedding...

472
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,560
Excuse me.

473
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,920
I don't have any related working experience

474
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,600
in weddings before,

475
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
so the post which is suitable for me is...

476
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,160
Post?

477
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,410
Miss Yao, you may misunderstand something.

478
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,620
The post which is suitable for you is certainly the bride.

479
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,320
Sorry, I'm late.

480
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,920
It doesn't matter.

481
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
This wedding company

482
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,240
is one of the best in China.

483
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,400
People must make an appointment six months in advance.

484
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,290
It was hard for me to make an appointment.

485
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,770
Where do you want to hold our wedding?

486
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,700
Paris? Hawaii?

487
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,840
I think New Zealand is also good.

488
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,840
How about

489
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,020
introducing other places to her?

490
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,760
Sorry,

491
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,940
we seem to have a misunderstanding.

492
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm busy.

493
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,630
Have a good chat.

494
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,370
Well, I... Listen to my...

495
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,660
I, I, I... Sorry.

496
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,910
What's the matter?

497
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,050
Are you really angry?

498
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Do you know that

499
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,860
today I refuse the interviews

500
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,720
of three hunter companies

501
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,130
for your trick?

502
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,260
How can you treat it as a trick?

503
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,830
Transnational corporation.
A flextime job

504
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,900
with excellent benefits.

505
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,620
Listen to my explanation.

507
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,090
My parents have migrated
to Canada long time ago,

508
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,680
so my home is a transnational corporation.

509
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,080
After you marry me and become Mrs. He,

510
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,210
you can do everything you want.

511
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,110
It's absolutely a flextime job.

512
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,140
All my deposits will belong to you.

513
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,920
All my money will also belong to you.

514
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
My house, car

515
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,770
and all my future salary

516
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,660
will also belong to you.

517
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,300
Aren't these benefits good enough?

518
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,780
About the handsome and kind-hearted boss,

519
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,440
you should know it.

520
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,840
Well, what do you treat me as?

521
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,120
When did I promise to marry you?

522
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,440
We have long approved of each other.

523
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,530
Our life is short. We shouldn't delay it.

524
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,790
Hello.

525
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,620
Miss Yao, we're deliverymen
of the furniture store.

526
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,220
We're at the door of your house.

527
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,360
Furniture store?

528
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,660
Be careful to take it apart.

529
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,330
OK.

530
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,280
Which room should we

531
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,410
install your bed in for you later?

532
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,620
Bed?

533
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,280
Well, you should missend them.

534
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,410
What are these?

535
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,240
I didn't order them.

536
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,840
This is the European deluxe double bed

537
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
ordered by Mr. He in our store.

538
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,940
And this sofa and wine cabinet

539
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Are you Miss Yao?

540
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,970
Do your loudspeaker boxes need
to be installed today?

541
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200
What on earth is the matter?

542
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,070
Don't, don't be anxious. Let me deal with it.

543
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,770
Take apart the bed inside for me.

544
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,110
Then move the new one in.

545
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,600
Well, what do you want to do?

546
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,090
Do you know this is a house I rented?

547
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,340
I know it,

548
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,320
but you're reluctant to live in my house,

549
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,740
so I can only learn from Xia Ke.

550
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,870
I can live with you.

551
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,840
This room is indeed a little small,

552
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,680
but you know that

553
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,950
I'm a designer,

554
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,970
so I assure that I'll make this small house
have a new look

555
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,500
and become our sweet home.

556
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,020
Now it's 17:00,

557
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,060
so you still have five hours

558
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,100
to put it back on the original settings here.

559
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,070
If here still looks like this

560
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,240
at 22:00,

561
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,490
I'll throw the lease.

562
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,010
I still can afford the liquidated damage.

563
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,330
Mr. He, what on earth should we do?

564
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,600
Miss Xing Yun,

565
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,400
Rome couldn't be built in a day.

566
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,420
It's time to get off work.

567
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,790
Leave first.

568
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,140
I still have many things to deal with.

569
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,340
You're so diligent.

570
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,640
How did Mr. Xia make you

571
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,510
work so hard for him before he left?

572
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,550
Workaholic is the deadly virus of love

573
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,780
but also an effective medicine
to cure loneliness.

574
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,420
Only when you fill your own time

575
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,270
can you stop missing the other party.

576
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,670
Many problems in the closed Beta test
need to be debugged,

577
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,680
so I really can't leave.

578
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,650
How about staying here
and working overtime with me?

579
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,060
We need to do something else,
so we're leaving.

580
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,640
Don't forget to have dinner.

581
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,520
We're leaving. Bye.

582
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,800
Remember to have dinner.
Don't hunger yourself.

583
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,250
Bye.

584
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,900
Our friendship is so worthless.

585
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,520
He must be too tired and busy,

586
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,880
so he was bad-tempered, right?

587
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,210
Besides working hard,

588
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
what else can I do to help him?

589
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,640
Yao Qing?

590
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,060
It's unexpected that

591
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I can see you in such a place.

592
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,700
Recently, you're always busy
with your family affairs,

593
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,140
so we all dare not bother you.

594
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,260
Where is He Yu?

595
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
What's wrong? Are you angry?

596
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,500
Who does he think he is?

597
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,140
He wants to control my life early.

598
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,780
Do you know that

599
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,260
he has even ordered the air tickets for

600
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,780
our next-year pre-wedding photos
and wedding trip?

601
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,630
In the mails sent by them,

602
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,620
they even call us Mr. He and Mrs. He.

603
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,800
It turns out that He Yu can be so crazy.

604
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,770
I really can't understand it.

605
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,930
You men all don't want to get married, right?

606
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,440
I remember that he always hid in your house

607
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,990
when his those ex-girlfriends

608
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,950
mentioned marriage before.

609
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,630
What's wrong with him now?
Become a marriage-aholic?

610
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,810
Miss Yao, do you know

611
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,230
how many girls will be angry
with these words?

612
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,460
I know that you want to

613
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,160
ask me to cherish it.

614
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,360
I also want to further develop
our relationship,

615
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,220
but it's too fast.

616
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,320
You should know that

617
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,650
a man wants to firmly control

618
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,780
the remaining years of the girl

619
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,440
when he meets a girl

620
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,420
he loves very much.

621
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,930
Do you refer to your Xing Yun?

622
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,820
Well, the thing about you
and your ex-girlfriend

623
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,130
causes a stir.

624
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,710
Isn't she jealous?

625
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,210
Did you drive here?

626
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,180
What's wrong?

627
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,000
I don't drink today,

628
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,010
so you don't need to
call a designated driver.

629
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,650
I can drive you back,

630
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,570
but you must do a favor for me.

631
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,400
She answers me.

632
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,240
Xing Yun says that she is still working
overtime in the company.

633
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,600
What do you want to do?

634
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,140
Why don't you ask her personally?

635
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,790
And, why do you borrow my car?

636
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,660
What on earth is your intention?

637
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Deceive the public.

638
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,240
Why didn't you turn the light on?

639
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,740
I have returned the furniture,

640
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,840
but you said

641
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,220
this sofa looked good
when you saw it in the street before.

642
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,600
It's the designer's limited edition,

643
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,380
and I ordered it for three months,

644
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,720
so, don't return it, OK?

645
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,720
But we were not together back then.

646
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,890
But I

647
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,620
remembered it unknowingly,

648
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,160
and as soon as I wanted to live with you,

649
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,380
I wanted to buy it.

650
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,980
Maybe I had treated you

651
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,260
differently long time ago.

652
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,080
Just forgive me.

653
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,840
I really want to consolidate our relationship.

654
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,410
This is the first time that I have such a feeling,

655
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,900
so I haven't known how to control it yet.

656
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,630
When a man meets

657
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,060
his favorite woman,

658
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,220
he wants this girl

659
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,430
to be caught in his remaining years firmly.

660
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,380
Now that you must leave this sofa,

661
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,380
and I won't pay for it,

662
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,660
so you can only sleep on it alone.

663
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,070
Wow!

664
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,200
Hello.

665
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,120
Why don't you speak?

666
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
What are you doing?

667
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,320
Wait for the elevator.

668
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,440
You're so diligent.

669
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
I work hard by order of you.

670
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,310
Should I reward you with something?

671
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,190
Are you still busy?

672
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
The elevator is here. Bye.

673
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,560
Xing Yun!

674
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,580
Xing Yun!

675
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,590
The blood glucose value is 7.1.

676
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,510
Both of the blood pressure and ECG are normal.

677
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,740
Why did she faint?

678
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,160
Because of cervical spondylosis

679
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,820
and excessive fatigue.

680
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,120
Xia Ke.

681
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,860
Aunt.

682
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,900
What's wrong with Yun?

683
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,350
The doctor says that she faints

684
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,230
because of cervical spondylosis.

685
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,900
Yeah. She is too tired recently.

686
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,860
She works overtime every day
and doesn't sleep at night.

687
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,350
Aunt, don't worry.

688
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,820
We learn from the X-ray film that

689
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,200
her spine has bent,

690
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,660
and her artery blood vessels are compressed

691
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,730
because of the various degrees
of all-around deviations nearby,

692
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,080
so she is giddy and has a headache.

693
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
We advise her to be hospitalized for a week.

694
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,290
She needs to be hospitalized?

695
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,840
Xia Ke, how are your family affairs?

696
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,410
They are waiting to be dealt with.

697
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,860
How about you going back to deal with them?

698
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,220
I'll stay here.

699
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,060
Come back to see her
after finishing dealing with them.

700
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,270
Thank you.

701
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
Thank you for looking after her.

702
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,860
Just torture yourself.
Go on torturing yourself.

703
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,730
You were so miserable
that you were sent into the hospital.

704
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,790
Now that you're so energetic,

705
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,440
don't only clean the CEO's office.

706
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,750
If you clean every corner

707
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,180
all over our company,

708
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,550
you still can stretch your arms and legs

709
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,040
and refresh yourself.

710
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,380
You're so pitiless.

711
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,580
I hear that Mr. Xia sent you in the hospital,

712
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,100
so it seems that your problem has been solved.

713
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,140
We didn't have any problem at all.

714
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,140
However, you make a contribution

715
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,160
for colleagues this time.

716
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,300
On the next day after you were hospitalized,

717
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,640
Mr. Xia called me

718
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,740
and asked me to order

719
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,750
a high-class massage armchair for us.

720
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,860
Everyone thanks you very much.

721
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,360
How about taking a selfie?

722
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,340
How about taking a group photo

723
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,200
and sending it into the company group?

724
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,280
Do it now.

725
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,990
Good idea.

726
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,230
Xing Yun, your face is the smallest

727
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,750
in history now.

728
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,840
Come on.

729
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,630
I look ugly! I look ugly!

730
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,120
Tomorrow Group gives up

731
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,400
M Company's acquisition case.

732
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,460
Chairman Fang has woken up.

733
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,130
As she is in poor health,

734
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,410
her eldest granddaughter
Shen Qing will succeed her

735
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,520
as the group leader.

736
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,480
The resounding disturbance of the Xia Family

737
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,340
comes to an end.

738
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,400
Shen Qing?

739
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,450
Yeah.

740
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,040
Unexpectedly, she inherits the group.

741
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,990
So Mr. Xia will go back to TIG.

742
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,240
The signing party
between Tiange Investment and us

743
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
will be held in next week.

744
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,450
Well,

745
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,880
now that we have got the funds,

746
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,630
and the instance also
needs to be promoted,

747
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,880
so our company must be undermanned.

748
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,220
I must leave hospital in advance.

749
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,760
You can't.

750
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,990
Don't worry about it.

751
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,760
Now the most important task for you is

752
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,240
to get better and attend the signing party.

753
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,240
Now Xing Yun looks like a rabbit.

754
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
So lovely.

755
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,240
Let's go.

756
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,040
If grandma didn't wake up in time,

757
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,250
we couldn't stop

758
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,370
the acquisition case so smoothly.

759
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,190
I always thought that

760
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,180
I had let her down early.

761
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,100
In fact, she still cares about you very much.

762
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,780
Don't be wise in retrospect,

763
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,540
OK?

764
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,160
So should you be depressed

765
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
or proud?

766
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
I just think that

767
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,920
grandma is old,

768
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,520
but she can see through everything.

769
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,680
In fact, you're always

770
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,480
the only candidate of inheritor in my heart.

771
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,000
Why don't you choose Xia Ke?

772
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,560
He thinks too much

773
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,710
and always takes on everything.

774
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,800
I don't want him to be overwhelmed

775
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,920
by such a heavy burden.

776
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
I think grandma still cares you
more than I do.

777
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,120
Well, you're free,

778
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,280
but whenever I summon you,

779
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,520
you must come back to help me.

780
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,150
OK.

781
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,840
How about I acquiring TIG?

782
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,060
Aren't you still stumped

783
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,800
by the things in hand?

784
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,880
Qing.

785
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,480
What's wrong? Are you regretful?

786
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,480
Beg me.

787
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,880
What food is good for cervical vertebra?

788
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,280
Today

789
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,520
can be said to be a very joyful day.

790
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,640
I'm hopeful of the future cooperation

791
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,170
between TIG and us.

792
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,520
Cheers!

793
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,440
Cheers.

794
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,500
Even the food in tea break is so good.

795
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,630
It's indeed a big company.

796
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,600
Then the lunch

797
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,580
may ruin my plan of losing weight.

798
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,020
The difference of losing weight is that

799
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,700
you choose to eat on tenterhooks

800
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,240
or immoderately.

801
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,150
Enjoy it.

802
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,280
Director Wang is really awesome.

803
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,620
He increases the investment fund

804
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,240
from 50 to 100 million yuan.

805
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,230
I know it.

806
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,170
But we can't owe it to Director Wang.

807
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,620
I hear that Mr. Xia signed a betting

808
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,920
agreement with Mr. Qin.

809
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,520
Is it amazing?

810
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,560
Mr. Xia doesn't stay
in our company these days,

811
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,480
but he remotely controls everything.

812
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,260
It seems that he has never planned
to give up TIG.

813
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,430
I think Mr. Xia also has never planned to

814
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,320
give up his mascot.

815
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,470
Are you better?

816
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,300
I haven't thanked you yet.

817
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,220
Thank you for sending me to the hospital that day.

818
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,380
Don't mention the thing that happened that day.

819
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,740
Take good care of yourself in the future.

820
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,620
You must be angry these days.

821
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,780
I can explain to you.

822
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,400
Mr. Xia, Mr. Qin is looking for you.

823
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,000
He wants to introduce
some of his cooperative partners to you.

824
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,280
Go to mind your business first.

825
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,540
Mr. Xia, let's go.

826
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,440
He is waiting for you.

827
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,240
Mr. Xia comes.

828
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,640
You're here.

829
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,280
Look, you know all these people.

830
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,110
This is...
