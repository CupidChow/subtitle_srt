00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,720
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,950
But, aren't you curious to know

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,480
where I stayed the night?

5
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,670
It couldn't have happened if your boss
hadn't asked you to work overtime,

6
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,550
and your family were not at home.

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
In that case, he couldn't have left you alone, right?

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're right.

9
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,110
But, he's a guy.

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,470
I planned to tell you about it,

11
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,030
but I was afraid I couldn't make it clear by phone.

12
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
And it was very late,

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,630
so, I had to stay over at his home.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,320
But nothing happened

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
between me and him.

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Are you afraid I'd get the wrong idea?

17
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Isn't it usually the case?

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,720
Don't worry. I won't get you wrong.

19
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,910
If you had an affair with your boss,

20
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
you couldn't have gone on a blind date.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Sounds reasonable.

22
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,030
Chu Nan, thank you for trusting me.

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Well. It's getting late.

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,550
I'll leave you be.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,160
Let me see you off.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't bother.

27
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,360
You're injured. How can I let you do that?

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Your father would scold me if he sees it.

29
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,800
Drive safely!

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,800
Bye.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,630
Pick it up.

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,550
Mr. Xia, why are you still there?

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm waiting for you to finish your work.

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,190
I'm sorry

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,160
to keep you waiting for two hours.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
Don't you feel bored?

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,390
No. I don't.

38
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,000
I had dinner.

39
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,630
And I listened to the stupid conversation

40
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,000
between you and your boyfriend.

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,600
What?

42
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,960
How can you eavesdrop on me?

43
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,190
The other day,

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,520
you gossiped about my private life

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
in the WeChat group.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,320
So, you took your revenge, right?

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,470
But I didn't expect

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,550
he has so much confidence in you.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,080
What do you mean?

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
It turns out he thinks

51
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,160
no men would have interest in you wherever you go.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,030
Mr. Xia, I know it's hard for you to understand,

53
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,880
but that's what it's like for adults.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,790
We have our own space

55
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,270
and also have much confidence in each other.

56
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,880
It's called mature love.

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,160
No offense,

58
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,320
but if you had learned from my boyfriend,

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,480
Shen Qing

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,200
couldn't have misunderstood us.

61
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Learn from him?

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm not as stupid as you.

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,600
Anyway, I don't have an obligation

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
to explain my private life to you.

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,670
Take your time and think it over.

66
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,880
I'll email you when I get the plan done.

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,270
Bye.

68
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,670
If you hang me up…

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm bound to deduct a large amount
from your year-end bonus.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,270
It takes a long time for a bone to heal properly.

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,480
You should take a few more days off.

72
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,440
Why are you anxious to come to the office?

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,510
It's okay.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
I've stayed at home for several days.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,600
I'm quite satisfied.

76
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,350
I'd rather come to the office

77
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,270
than stay at home

78
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,510
and talk to my boss on WeChat.

79
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,920
He really cares about you.

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,950
I hope I can see him someday.

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,070
He's short-tempered,

82
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,200
but he always strives for perfection
as for his work.

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,270
I can learn a lot from him in this aspect.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,790
I just wish

85
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,160
he could stop monitoring us.

86
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,950
Get on.

87
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,270
Do you want to have some cake?

88
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,510
Shall we pull off and get some?

89
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,920
No.

90
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,200
Is it because you think it's embarrassing

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,390
to admit you like to eat cake?

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Miss Shen, are you going out?

93
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,510
Mr. Li.

94
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,950
Nina's Dad.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,390
You know him, too.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,200
He often came to my mom recently.

97
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,000
He also said he wants to be my dad.

98
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Chu Nan, I think we've got the wrong way.

99
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,920
Chu Nan, what's wrong?

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
Chu Nan, sorry.

101
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,110
Xing Yun.

102
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,920
Let's get married.

103
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,200
Huh?

104
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,000
I suddenly proposed to you just now.

105
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,670
You must be scared, right?

106
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,880
Can you ask your mom

107
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,670
for the invoice when you go back?

108
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,920
I'll pay for it.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,270
Are you refusing my proposal?

110
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,920
No.

111
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,110
Yes.

112
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,440
No. I mean

113
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,550
I've never thought about getting married

114
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,110
now that we just got to know
each other a month ago.

115
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,670
I think the bracelet must be expensive.

116
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,760
If I can't pay it off,

117
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
I can pay by monthly installments.

118
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,200
I can also write you an IOU.

119
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Even if you don't want to marry me,

120
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,080
you don't have to consider me

121
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,590
a penny pincher.

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,840
I didn't mean it.

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,640
Alright. I see.

124
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
It's me that should say sorry.

125
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,670
I've been under pressure recently.

126
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,400
Just forget about the proposal.

127
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,350
Are you okay?

128
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,150
Is it about your work?

129
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,320
Go home. Don't let your parents worry about you.

130
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,030
Drive safely.

131
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,280
I really don't know

132
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,280
what I'm doing.

133
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
Chu Nan proposed to you!

134
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,280
What a perfect matchmaker I am!

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,640
I can't help admiring myself.

136
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,000
Show me the diamond ring.

137
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,670
There is no ring.

138
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,110
Don't try to lie to me.

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,670
Chu Nan is generous.

140
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,350
Tell me. When are you getting married?

141
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,640
Where will you hold the wedding ceremony?

142
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,440
This wedding dress is great.

143
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,350
You can try it on.

144
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,000
No way. I have to ask him about it.

145
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,590
Stop it.

146
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,110
I didn't say yes.

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,150
Yun, you have to plan for yourself.

148
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,470
Life is short.

149
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,790
I'm telling you.

150
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,550
Never listen to those celibates.

151
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,030
What they say about freedom
or vagabondage is all nonsense.

152
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,200
Women are born to be animals who like to nest.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,910
A marriage is like a nest.

154
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,880
When you get married,

155
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,470
you'll have someone to rely on

156
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,880
and feel safe.

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,030
Look at me.

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,470
I'm getting into a new nest

159
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,640
soon after I got out of an old one.

160
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,520
You know, Chu Nan is…

161
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,520
Here is how the project related
to “Infinite Unknown Love”

162
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,840
is progressing.

163
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,110
We've also prepared promotion plans

164
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,520
and the quarterly financial statements.

165
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,590
Please let us know
if there is anything we can improve.

166
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,670
As for the project,

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
I've heard the person-in-charge

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,350
has no experience of planning at all.

169
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't you think it's too risky?

170
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,150
I trust her.

171
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,230
Mr. Xia, we've checked

172
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,550
that girl's background.

173
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,200
I don't think she has any special talent.

174
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,790
She graduated from a common university

175
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,840
and her previous work

176
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,880
has nothing to do with planning.

177
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,790
If you don't like the current planner,

178
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,840
we can hire a new one

179
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,520
even if we may have to pay more.

180
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,000
How about someone who has studied abroad?

181
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,110
For TIG, what's most important
is not qualifications,

182
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,280
but capacity.

183
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,350
Lots of people finish their work
by using others' experience for reference

184
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,760
and even copying,

185
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,590
but we need those
who are enthusiastic about their job

186
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,350
and can think creatively.

187
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Come out. Let me have a look.

188
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,200
I think you'll steal the show

189
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,400
if you're my bridesmaid.

190
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,590
Really?

191
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm leaving.

192
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm absent from work to keep you company.

193
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,910
Come on. You'll be my bridesmaid
no matter what. Okay?

194
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,030
Pass me your cell phone.

195
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,150
For what?

196
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,840
To take a picture of you.

197
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,760
You look so nice in it.

198
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,030
Perfect. I'll send it to Chu Nan.

199
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,110
Miss, do me a favor.

200
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,640
Don't. Give it back.

201
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:03,960
Hold on.

202
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,520
Stop it.

203
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,000
Chu Nan, come marry me!

204
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,760
Xing Cheng!

205
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,590
I can't give it back now.

206
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,150
What if you withdraw it?

207
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,150
Withdraw it!

208
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,030
Miss, take it away.

209
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,910
Hurry up. Take it away.

210
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,960
Give it back to me.

211
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,910
I'll give it back to you soon!

212
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,670
Just after the shooting.

213
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,280
You bully me.

214
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,590
Speed is everything

215
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,200
in the market.

216
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,280
Nobody cares about how you do it.

217
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,470
For game developers, every minute counts.

218
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,610
You're gambling.

219
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,110
(Xing Yun: Come marry me)
You're gambling.

220
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,400
(Xing Yun: Come marry me)

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,010
(Xing Yun: Come marry me)
What if she screws it up?

222
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,710
What if she screws it up?

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,640
Xia Ke.

224
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,110
Mr. Sun,

225
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,880
as far as I know,

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,280
besides “Infinite Unknown Love”,

227
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,280
you also invested in three other games.

228
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,760
That's right.

229
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,320
Their production cycles and update rates

230
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,400
are better than ours,

231
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
but we're the only one that makes profits.

232
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,960
Am I right?

233
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,110
Uh.

234
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,550
To improve the efficiency,

235
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm going back now to supervise
and urge the person-in-charge.

236
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,910
We're pressed for time. I'm leaving.

237
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,550
How can he…

238
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,520
He's too arrogant.

239
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,280
Mr. Sun, calm down.

240
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,550
Why haven't you been back?

241
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,280
I spent too much time on shooting.

242
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
I even missed my lunch.

243
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,910
I'll be back after having some noodles.

244
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Hurry up.

245
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,110
Amy just called and said

246
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,670
she and Xia Ke are on the way back.

247
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,640
Isn't he having a meeting with investors?

248
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,550
Why is he back so soon?

249
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,640
Did he offend investors again?

250
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,200
You know me so well.

251
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,590
Mr. Xia.

252
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
I know the lunch break is over.

253
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm going back now.

254
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,960
Where did you go in the morning?

255
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,400
Um.

256
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,670
I went out for inspiration.

257
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
You don't like that restaurant, right?

258
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,000
So, I went out to seek inspiration.

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,670
I'm going back.

260
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,400
Come back.

261
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,280
Finish your noodles.

262
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,110
Oh.

263
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,710
Do you know

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
what's the most sensitive subject
in a relationship?

265
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
Of course it's break-up.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
It's marriage.

267
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,000
Why?

268
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,910
Isn't marriage the happy ending everyone wants?

269
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,470
It also means game over.

270
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,280
You were absent from work to take photos, right?

271
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,400
Uh. It's not me.

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,470
It's my cousin that took it.

273
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,470
Maybe it's because I put you
on the top of my contact list, so she…

274
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,280
Mr. Xia, I'm sorry.

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,230
I shouldn't have skipped work

276
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,910
to keep my cousin company.

277
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,230
Are you so eager to get married?

278
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's get married.

279
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,440
No. No!

280
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,760
I didn't say yes. Really.

281
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,200
So, Chu Nan really proposed to you?

282
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,230
I'll get some tissues.

283
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Miss, the bank balance is insufficient.

284
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,350
As for the rest,

285
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,760
how will you pay for it?

286
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,550
Mr. Xia,

287
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,350
I think you have a good figure.

288
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,760
You're handsome no matter what clothes you wear.

289
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,350
How about trying other brands?

290
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,520
What's expensive may not be good.

291
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
Sounds reasonable. I'll take this one.

292
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,110
I'll pay by this card.

293
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,590
Take my suit to the cleaners

294
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,960
when you go back.

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
It cost me two months of salaries.

296
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
It's blackmail!

297
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,280
I've got a headache.

298
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,560
it's your head that hurts or your heart?

299
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Both of them.

300
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,190
Xu Yiyi even told you a lot about my schedule.

301
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,040
Didn't she tell you

302
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,160
how much you can earn as a planner?

303
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,920
Oh. I almost forgot the bonus.

304
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,310
Mr. Xia, how much can I get from the project?

305
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,950
Yiyi usually receives a bonus twice as much as mine.

306
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,470
She's just a common planner,

307
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,430
but I'm the person-in-charge of the project.

308
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,040
Besides, I'll have a quarterly bonus,
over-time pay and a year-end bonus.

309
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,680
Mr. Xia, it's my fault this time.

310
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
This suit is a gift from me to show my apology.

311
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,950
Don't thank me.

312
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,830
Are you an idiot?

313
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,040
Dongdong laughed at me

314
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
because I wore a one-piece swimsuit

315
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
when we went to a hot spring for teambuilding.

316
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,710
Shall I get a two-piece one?

317
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,160
When did you start to

318
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,110
care about what they said?

319
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,110
I'm 24, okay?

320
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,040
If Chu Nan hears

321
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,800
their words,

322
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,830
it'll be embarrassing.

323
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,070
Chu Nan? Will he join us?

324
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,430
Yep. Everyone can take a partner, right?

325
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,880
You just refused his proposal.

326
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,880
Are you sure you want to invite him?

327
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,230
Actually, I'm not.

328
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,040
Since I said no,

329
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
I feel like everything is weird between us.

330
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,520
Yiyi said I can take advantage of this chance

331
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
to foster our relationship.

332
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,710
Mr. Xia, what do you think of it?

333
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm curious about what on earth he wants to do.

334
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm determined.

335
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
I have to do something.

336
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,560
I didn't hire you to do shopping.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,640
Why are you angry again?

338
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,350
Add a piece of each kind of them.

339
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,190
Add some dried fish floss.

340
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,680
Now you can roll it.

341
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,070
Roll it up.

342
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,920
Mom, we're not going on a spring outing.

343
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,350
We're going to a five-star resort.

344
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,230
Three meals and even afternoon tea are available.

345
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
I didn't ask you to take it to the hotel.

346
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,280
It's for you to eat on the way.

347
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Huh?

348
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,800
It's a two or three hours' ride, right?

349
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,110
What if you feel bored

350
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,470
and there is an awkward silence?

351
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,470
What should I do?

352
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,640
Just eat!

353
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,070
No awkward silence can't be broken by food.

354
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,070
Silly girl, let me tell you.

355
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,470
When you're in a relationship,

356
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,830
you have to feed each other sometimes.

357
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,400
It helps give relationships a boost.

358
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,110
That's what your mom and I used to do.

359
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,760
She was as thin as a wafer
before we got married.

360
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
See how much weight she has put on?

361
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,590
What do you mean?

362
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,190
I mean you're more beautiful than you were.

363
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,190
Come on.

364
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,470
Are you ashamed of me?

365
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,070
I even didn't have time to get a new swimsuit.

366
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,190
This one is not bad, right?

367
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,560
Top 128 topics

368
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,680
you can talk about in a relationship.

369
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,230
Xing Yun, it's the first time

370
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,590
you and Chu Nan will go on a tour together.

371
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,070
Make some preparations.

372
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,160
Come on. I'm going out for fun, not for an exam.

373
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
It's hard!

374
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,520
Hello? Amy.

375
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,950
What?

376
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,590
Chu Nan, I'm sorry

377
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,000
to have kept you waiting by the road.

378
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm afraid you have to go there alone.

379
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,560
What's going on?

380
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,560
My boss informed us this morning

381
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,920
all employees have to go there by coach

382
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,110
and the others go there by themselves.

383
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,590
It's weird.

384
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,680
Xing Yun, hurry up!

385
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,710
There is no time. I'm leaving.

386
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
See you in the resort.

387
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,830
Safe trip.

388
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,350
Keep in contact.

389
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,310
Okay. See you later.

390
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,470
Morning!

391
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,110
Xing Yun!

392
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,830
Morning!

393
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
Here.

394
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,950
Here is the last stop.

395
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Morning, Mr. Xia.

396
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,430
Mr. Xia, actually, you could have saved money

397
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,470
on renting such a good coach.

398
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,880
We can go there by ourselves.

399
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,920
Are you teaching me how I should spend my money?

400
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,470
Is the planning scheme finished?

401
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Nah.

402
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,280
Sorry, Mr. Xia.

403
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,070
I didn't sleep well last night.
It's not stained, right?

404
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,640
That'd be great.

405
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,950
I'd have to live on air this month

406
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,430
if I buy a jacket for you.

407
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,000
What were you murmuring?

408
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,470
Nothing.

409
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,760
When will we be there?

410
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,430
No awkward silence can't be broken by food.

411
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,880
Mr. Xia.

412
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,230
The sushi is mine, right?

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
It explains why it tastes so bad.

414
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm sorry about that.

415
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,280
This is the design drawing for the main cake.

416
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,470
It has been modified as required.

417
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,110
You have to

418
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
use strawberries imported from Japan.

419
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,590
Actually, it's not the best season

420
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,400
to have strawberries.

421
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,230
Besides, it'll be difficult for us

422
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,400
to make sure they're mature if they're imported.

423
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,560
It may influence the taste of the cake.

424
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,280
Just tell the truth if you can't make it.

425
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,710
Don't give such a lame excuse

426
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,520
to fool us.

427
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,470
I'm telling you.

428
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,710
I don't care how it tastes

429
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,760
or if it's mature.

430
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
I just want imported strawberries.

431
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,470
Even if you don't care,

432
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,640
I'd never let my clients

433
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,950
get any dessert that tastes bad.

434
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,880
I don't want to damage our reputation.

435
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,280
You even can't do such a simple thing.

436
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,880
Honey, don't be angry.

437
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,110
Calm down.

438
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,280
You should be happy on our wedding anniversary.

439
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,920
Your makeup is messed up.

440
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,760
Why not go fix it?

441
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
I'll have a talk with Miss Shen.

442
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Imported strawberries only!

443
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,520
Sorry, Miss Shen.

444
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,680
My wife is short-tempered.

445
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,310
Please don't take it seriously.

446
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,000
However, she said something right.

447
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,830
You're such a beautiful woman.

448
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,800
Any cake will taste great

449
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,070
as long as it's made by you.

450
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,310
Mr. Lin, do you want to

451
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,800
have a taste of the cake?

452
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,310
I made it myself.

453
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,070
Yes, with pleasure!

454
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,560
You're sensible.

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,230
Enjoy it.

456
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,830
We're already here.

457
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,590
It's okay. No hurry.

458
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,800
It doesn't matter if you come late.

459
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,230
Be safe.

460
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
Is your boyfriend still on the way?

461
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,830
What's going on?

462
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,160
He said serial rear-end accidents
happened on the highway.

463
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,280
He'll be here late.

464
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,230
What's wrong with our boss?

465
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,640
Now that he wanted to come here by coach,

466
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,710
why didn't he rent two?

467
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,040
He doesn't lack money.

468
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,230
Shen Qing, why are you here?

469
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
It's you.

470
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,470
How is it going with your ankle?

471
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,350
I can move freely.

472
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,070
We're here for teambuilding.

473
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,520
Really?

474
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,400
So, Xia Ke is also here, right?

475
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
Isn't…she…she…

476
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,880
Xia Ke's…

477
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,110
It's said she's Mr. Xia's girlfriend.

478
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,680
Why are you here?

479
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,040
Honey, why are you here so late?

480
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,760
I've been waiting for you for so long.

481
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
I don't think I made an appointment with you.

482
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,640
Come on. You always forget about what I said.

483
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,110
Who is she?

484
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,950
Look. OMG.

485
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,710
Amy, help us check in.

486
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,880
Mr. Xia, the rooms haven't been done.

487
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,000
We have to wait a second.

488
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,800
But the view nearby is great.

489
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
We can look around for a while.

490
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,880
Oh. There is

491
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,920
an eco-tourism attraction nearby.

492
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,230
It's worth visiting.

493
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,070
Let's go.

494
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,160
Mr. Xia, I'll stay.

495
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,160
My boyfriend hasn't arrived.

496
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,190
I'll wait for him here.

497
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,110
Amy, Xing Yun doesn't want to
join the group activity.

498
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,920
Her year-end bonus will be deducted.

499
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,520
Year-end bonus? Mr. Xia.

500
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,520
It's about your year-end bonus. Let's go.

501
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,430
It's a large amount.

502
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,920
You're short of money. It's important to you.

503
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,680
Look!

504
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,430
Over there.

505
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,470
There is a big fountain there.

506
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,160
When on earth will you stop it?

507
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,110
Why are you so boring nowadays?

508
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,110
I'm in a good mood today.

509
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,070
You haven't come to me recently.

510
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
My son and I miss you.

511
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,230
Did you fall in love with someone else?

512
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,520
What are you talking about?

513
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,680
You said you'll take care of me

514
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,110
all your life.

515
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,110
I'm telling you.

516
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,560
I'll teach you a good lesson if you lie to me.

517
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I've never seen it before.

518
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,680
What's up?

519
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,830
Mr. Xia is usually a cold fish.

520
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,310
I can't believe he's so nice to a woman.

521
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,230
Amy, I'm telling you.

522
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,070
You have to be more careful.

523
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,800
You're Mr. Xia's private secretary.

524
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
Don't let her get you wrong.

525
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,310
It's none of my business.

526
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,310
As a secretary of Administration Dept.,

527
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm just responsible for Mr. Xia's official business.

528
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,430
It's Xing Yun that should be more careful,

529
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,640
now that she's the company's mascot.

530
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,230
Stop talking nonsense. I'm a nobody.

531
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,000
The holiday resort

532
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
is located in a national
ecological preservation area.

533
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
With a green coverage rate

534
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,190
of up to 99%,

535
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,640
it's known as a natural oxygen bar.

536
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,000
On my left is “Cloud Valley Waterfall”.

537
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,400
It's a good place to have a group photo taken

538
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,590
as a memento.

539
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,560
Let me help you do it.

540
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,400
Great!

541
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,430
Here you are.

542
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Thank you!

543
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,280
One. Two. Three.

544
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,000
Thank you!

545
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,230
It's great!

546
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,950
Xing Yun,

547
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,950
I've heard you're the company's mascot.

548
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,000
What do you do?

549
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,400
Don't listen to them. They're joking.

550
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,710
Isn't it a special position

551
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,470
Mr. Xia set up for you?

552
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,640
Stop it.

553
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Actually, Xing Yun has a lot of luck.

554
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,880
We'll pass through all crises safely

555
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,800
as long as she's there with us.

556
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,590
She often brings us good luck.

557
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,310
Really? What has happened?

558
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,040
Well. It's pure coincidence.

559
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,430
It's definitely not!

560
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,710
Let me give you a classic example.

561
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,760
The rear-end accident. Right?

562
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,160
That's right.

563
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,160
Mr. Xia, are you okay?

564
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,160
I told you to go back.

565
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,070
Why are you still here?

566
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
Take the pills to help you sober up.

567
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,160
Here you are.

568
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,590
Haven't they said yes?

569
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,400
How about like this?

570
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,400
I don't mind drinking a few beers with them.

571
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
Let me take the place of you.

572
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,880
Forget about it.

573
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,880
Mr. Jin didn't show up at all.

574
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,230
I wonder how you passed the driving test.

575
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,920
You're just a road killer.

576
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,430
Sorry.

577
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,880
I'll make up for all your losses.

578
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,040
I have something else to do.

579
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:27,920
Well.

580
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,560
Let's exchange phone numbers.

581
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,310
I'll see you in the car dealership tomorrow.

582
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,190
Are you Mr. Jin Zhichen?

583
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,160
Yes.

584
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,400
We had been trying to see him during the previous week.

585
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,560
We couldn't have met him

586
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,760
if Xing Yun hadn't rear-ended him.

587
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,070
She's lucky, right?

588
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,680
It seemed it's because of her good luck,

589
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
but I think it's because of her loyalty.

590
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,310
It was late at night.

591
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,470
She didn't go home

592
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,760
but kept waiting at the gate.

593
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,680
That contract was important for us
as an early stage startup.

594
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
I was worried that Mr. Xia…

595
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,880
I'd lose my job

596
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,230
if anything happened to him.

597
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,160
I still remember what happened
when we tried to get authorization.

598
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,190
You know,

599
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,590
I witnessed it.

600
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,000
About the copyright of “Infinite Unknown Love”.

601
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,560
Exactly.

602
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,160
We've been here for three times,

603
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,350
but he still refused to give the authorization.

604
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,190
I'm afraid it's hopeless.

605
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,830
I don't think so.

606
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,950
He doesn't look like a greedy man.

607
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,880
Maybe he's just not confident about us.

608
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,160
He's afraid we can't do it well.

609
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,310
If we can show him our sincerity

610
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,590
and let him believe

611
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,190
we can create the characters he wants,

612
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,350
he may say yes.

613
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,710
But we've repeated many times.

614
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,830
Maybe we should try to draw them.

615
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,400
Have you got an idea?

616
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,800
I've thought about it numerous times.

617
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,760
I'll go back and draw them now.

618
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,950
Don't bother.

619
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,640
Are you sure we'll do that?

620
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,680
I think it's illegal.

621
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,280
What if he calls the police?

622
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,950
Then we'll paint the wall

623
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,190
in white again.

624
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,040
I think

625
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,160
it's a crazy idea.

626
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Do you have confidence?

627
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,950
Without doubt,

628
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,800
that guy was moved

629
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,760
by Xing Yun's painting.

630
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,040
Of course.

631
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,640
The painting is still there.

632
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,950
The author is very happy
about the games designed by us.

633
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,590
I've heard a lot of players

634
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,560
have been there for a visit.

635
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,590
We couldn't have made it without Xing Yun

636
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,000
and Mr. Xia.

637
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,950
Xing Yuan, it seems that you and Mr. Xia

638
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,590
have a tacit mutual understanding.

639
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,590
It's not something you can get
just by working hard.

640
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,160
No wonder he can't do anything without you.

641
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Guys, it's not the right time

642
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,470
to recall the past.

643
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,640
Mr. Xia,

644
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,470
explain to her, please!

645
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,190
I'm afraid I have to go.

646
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,520
I want to have a rest.

647
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,680
Are you going back now?

648
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,800
The rooms haven't been done.

649
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,590
We can take a boat trip on the lake.

650
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm okay. I'll go take a seat in the lobby.

651
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,430
Sis., when are you going back?

652
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,280
Sis.?

653
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,070
It's no fun.

654
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,350
Do you have to do that

655
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,710
in their face?

656
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,640
But you're surnamed Shen
and he's surnamed Xia.

657
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,310
Right.

658
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
Our parents passed away early.

659
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,160
To remember them, I took my mom's surname.

660
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,190
Aren't you going back?

661
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,040
I suddenly feel much better.

662
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,880
I'd better stay.

663
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,640
When will we take a boat trip?

664
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,230
I haven't done it for a long time!

665
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,320
Chu Nan, there you are!

666
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,320
Chu Nan.

667
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,120
Your boyfriend, right? Introduce him to us.

668
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
They're my good friends.

669
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,800
Amy and Yiyi.

670
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,320
Hi. I'm Chu Nan.

671
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,150
Hi.

672
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,630
Chu Nan?

673
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,280
Virgin?
(*Chu Nan sounds similar to virgin in Chinese)

674
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,800
Chu…

675
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,390
Yiyi.

676
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,080
Sorry.

677
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
I just think it's a good name for a blind date.

678
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,320
It's okay. I'm used to it.

679
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,710
Many people joke about my name.

680
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,710
This is Mr. Xia, my boss.

681
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,280
This is Shen Qing, his sister.

682
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,080
Mr. Xia, this is my boyfriend Chu Nan.

683
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,360
Is Xia Ke your boss?

684
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,000
Do you know each other?

685
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,230
We…

686
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,040
Mr. Chu, the check-in procedure is all set.

687
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,710
Here is the room key for you and Miss Xing Yun.

688
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,120
An administrative suite with a lake view.
It's at the annexe.

689
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
A waiter will take you there.

690
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,150
A suite is three times as expensive as a standard room.

691
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,080
Are we singled out for special treatment?

692
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,280
Mr. Chu asked us to upgrade you.

693
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,230
Sorry, Mr. Chu.

694
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,230
We have a limited budget.

695
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
Don't worry, Mr. Xia. I'll pay for it.

696
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,120
Now that it's so much fun here,

697
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,040
I'll also stay.

698
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,710
Miss, is there any room available?

699
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,000
I want a suite, too.

700
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,600
I want to indulge myself once in a while.

701
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,470
It's on me.

702
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,360
Okay. This way, please.

703
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,470
Mr. Xia, do you know each other or not?

704
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,710
-No. -No.

705
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,320
Come on.

706
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,230
Cheers.

707
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,470
Chu Nan, don't drink too much.

708
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,230
Have some dishes.

709
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,840
Let me get some for you.

710
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,560
How about Stewed Pork with Brown Sauce?

711
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,560
Mr. Xia, I don't think
I've done anything to offend you.

712
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,630
Pure coincidence. Yum!

713
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,470
Here is Roast Duck!

714
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,320
Great!

715
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,230
I've heard Roast Duck here

716
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,150
is served with special sauce. It's delicious!

717
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's have a taste.

718
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,230
Mr. Xia, after you.

719
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,430
Mr. Xia, I know your taste best.

720
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,230
Only carrot, no green onion.

721
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,520
A moderate amount of duck meat,

722
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
with some sweet bean sauce.

723
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,870
A little more.

724
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,840
And more.

725
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,230
Mr. Xia, is it your cup of tea?

726
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,360
He's picky.

727
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,950
What he likes must be delicious.
Have a taste.

728
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
Miss, take Roast Duck away.

729
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Don't! We haven't had a taste.

730
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,870
Leave it to us if you don't like it.

731
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,710
Shen Qing, do you want to have a try?

732
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,910
I'll get one for you

733
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,630
for fear that your hands get dirty.

734
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,760
That's right. Let me get one, too.

735
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,630
Okay! Everyone is here, right?

736
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,800
Alright.

737
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,840
Tonight, we'll play a game,

738
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,560
which is called “Never and Ever”.

739
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
According to the rules,

740
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,280
when someone stands up and says

741
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,760
“I've never done something”,

742
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,840
everyone else here that has ever done it

743
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
will have to drink.

744
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,870
How do you like it?

745
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,560
It's fun! I'm in!

746
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,670
It sounds exciting!

747
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,190
Mr. Xia, how about starting from you?

748
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,280
Mr. Xia!

749
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,280
Mr. Xia!

750
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,150
Mr. Xia!

751
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,150
Mr. Xia!

752
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,230
Mr. Xia!

753
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,000
Mr. Xia!

754
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,230
Mr. Xia!

755
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,840
I'm your boss. Do you dare
to listen to my secrets?

756
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,280
Do you mean you're not in?

757
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,800
Are you going to stay here just to laugh at us?

758
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,280
Well.

759
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,120
You're our boss.

760
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,520
We won't seek into your personal affairs.

761
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,230
How about being the judge?

762
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,520
Okay.

763
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,630
Before we get started, I have to make it clear.

764
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,710
No lies!

765
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,000
You have to drink if you've ever done it.

766
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,710
Liars will be single all their life.

767
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,040
Okay.

768
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,760
It's cruel.

769
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,840
Dying alone is

770
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,000
the cruelest curse in the world.

771
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,710
You…

772
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,040
So what? Are you in or out?

773
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,470
Of course I'm in!

774
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,560
I'll let you know what I can do soon.

775
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,870
Wait and see.

776
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,080
Okay. I'll be the first one.

777
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,470
I've never met anyone

778
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,000
I want to marry at the first sight.

779
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,150
What's up?

780
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,190
Xu Yiyi, you're married.

781
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,430
Your husband would feel awkward
if he knows about it.

782
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,390
We studied at the same college.

783
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,190
It's a different case.

784
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,870
We didn't fall in to love at the first sight.

785
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,800
He drank.

786
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,600
No wonder they're upgraded to a suite.

787
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,190
Xing Yun, he wants to marry you.

788
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,760
Marry her!

789
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,470
Marry her!

790
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,600
Marry her!

791
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,360
Marry her!

792
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,470
Marry her!

793
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,870
Marry her!

794
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,080
Enough.

795
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,390
Neither of them said anything.

796
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,150
How about like this?

797
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,150
You don't need to marry today.

798
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,520
Do it tomorrow.

799
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,560
Come on.

800
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,630
It's my turn.

801
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,950
I want to say

802
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
something like being rescued by a hot guy

803
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,800
has never happened to me.

804
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,760
What a cliché!

805
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
Are you still suffering

806
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,360
because of it?

807
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,470
Unbelievable.

808
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,280
Rescued by a hot guy. Love at first sight.
Giving your heart to each other.

809
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,430
It's a complete drama.

810
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
It's a cliché,

811
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,080
but we can also say

812
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,910
it's a classic love story.

813
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,390
I think both Xing Yun

814
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,430
and Chu Nan have to drink.

815
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,190
Right. Both of you.

816
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,560
Hurry up.

817
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,150
It's not Chu Nan.

818
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,080
It's one of my friends.

819
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,230
You're the judge, right?

820
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm thirsty.

821
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,150
You're not good at

822
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,870
playing the game at all.

823
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,320
Get ready. I'll say something interesting.

824
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,430
Come on. Just do it.

825
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,190
I…

826
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:37,520
I've never slept on a man's bed.

827
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,760
Come on, Dongdong.

828
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,360
It's boring.

829
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,630
Boring.

830
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,040
All ladies, drink!

831
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,910
Xing Yun, you have to drink.

832
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,710
You have a boyfriend.

833
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,870
Bottom up!

834
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,870
Xing Yun, drink!

835
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,470
I didn't expect you're going fast.

836
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,520
We didn't.

837
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,360
What do you mean?

838
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,910
Xing Yun, it's not Chu Nan?

839
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,360
It's unexpected, Xing Yun.

840
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,840
It's a surprise.

841
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,800
Who is it? Tell me about it.

842
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,230
Stop it.

843
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,390
Tell us who it is.

844
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,430
Dongdong, get us a fruit salad.

845
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,470
She's going to tell the truth.

846
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,080
Hurry up.

847
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,870
Got it. I'll ask you about it later.

848
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,520
I hope you enjoy yourselves.

849
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,390
I'm a little tired.

850
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,470
I want to go back.

851
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,150
It's getting late.

852
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,910
Let's do it.

853
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,600
We're going back, too.

854
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,080
It's the perfect time to have a spa.

855
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,190
Xing Yun, go with us.

856
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,000
Relax yourself

857
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,600
and you'll have a good-night sleep tonight.

858
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,840
What spa?

859
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,630
A woman has to be nice to herself.

860
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,910
Chu Nan, we'll take Xing Yun away for a while.

861
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,950
You don't mind, right?

862
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,000
Of course not.

863
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,470
You'll thank us.

864
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,600
Alright. Can you see us?

865
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,040
The live streaming is going to start.

866
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,710
I'm telling you.

867
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,870
A date is also about visual art.

868
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,670
You'll be more likely to have a sweet date

869
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,360
if you have a good makeup style.

870
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,670
It has proved itself to be a good place.

871
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,390
It's gorgeous.

872
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,430
I've heard there is a massage bathtub here.

873
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,040
Come enjoy it in my room.

874
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,320
Good idea!

875
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,120
I'll ask all girls to be here

876
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,360
and have a foot bath in your room.

877
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,800
Are you a friend or not?

878
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,430
So,

879
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,630
you've changed your mind?

880
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:03,910
Mr. Xia!

881
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,600
Mr. Xia.
