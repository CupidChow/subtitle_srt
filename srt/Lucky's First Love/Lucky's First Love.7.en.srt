00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,620
=Episode 7=

3
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,940
Mr. Xia, you have two meetings this afternoon,

4
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,380
and I've booked the large conference room for you

5
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,280
at 3:00 p.m.

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
Is Xing Yun here?

7
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
Xing Yun? She's here.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,500
Tell her to come to my office.

9
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,380
OK.

10
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,380
Mr. Xia, you wanted to see me?

11
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,860
You're still angry.

12
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,020
I've already sent
the work report to your email.

13
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,140
If you have no objections,

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,300
we can begin

15
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,180
the feature seminar and demo production.

16
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,380
If there's nothing else,
I'll see myself out.

17
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,180
Hold on.

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,940
You're venting your frustration
over a breakup

19
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,980
at work.

20
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,620
This behavior is childish.

21
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,260
Mr. Xia, if my words or actions

22
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,900
don't meet the standards of a TIG employee,

23
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,500
I'll look through the employee handbook
after seeing myself out

24
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,140
and make improvements.

25
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,100
I'll be seeing myself out now.

26
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,020
That wasn't what I meant.

27
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,460
Mr. Xia. Mr. Xia.

28
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,460
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

29
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Hold on. Thank you, Mr. Xia.

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,420
Xing Yun, come on.

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
I'll take the next one.

32
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,980
What? This is rush hour,

33
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,180
and there's plenty of space here.

34
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,260
If you're not getting in,
don't hold everyone up.

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,780
Xing Yun! Xing Yun!

36
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,420
Xing Yun!

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,300
She really left!

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,180
Xing Yun.

39
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,300
Mr. Xia.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,260
Hello? Mr. Xia.

41
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,140
Amy, bring me a cup of coffee.

42
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,860
Right away.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,540
On second thought, never mind.
I'll get it myself.

44
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,620
Look, look, look. He's coming out again.

45
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,780
Xing Yun, let me tell you,

46
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,860
when it comes to making coffee,

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,460
I just can't make it well enough for him.

48
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,540
He has very abnormal taste.

49
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,100
He makes an Americano with 4 cups of water
and 6 cups of coffee beans.

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,860
If you use a regular ratio,

51
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,780
it just won't be bitter enough for him.

52
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,900
You make it.

53
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,860
Mr. Xia, Xing Yun said
she'll make some coffee for you.

54
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,620
I'll wait.

55
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,460
Just a moment.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,140
You can't do that! That's enough!

57
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,780
What are you doing?

58
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,740
Cut it out.

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,460
That's salt!

60
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,300
Mr. Xia, your coffee.

61
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,660
Don't!

62
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,620
What is this?

63
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,900
Sorry, Mr. Xia.

64
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,100
I wanted to add sugar,

65
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,660
but the break room's out of sugar.

66
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,580
I thought you'd get upset if you found out,

67
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,220
so I didn't tell you,

68
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,340
and added some salt instead.

69
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,380
I didn't tell you the truth,

70
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,940
but it was for your sake.

71
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,620
I hope you can be considerate of my intentions.

72
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,620
So, Mr. Xia,

73
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,380
please don't be angry at Xing Yun.

74
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,860
She, she's mostly not being deliberate
in opposing you.

75
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,540
As you know,

76
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,100
this is the first time
she's been in charge of a project.

77
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,460
She's been working day and night
for almost a week.

78
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,500
She's only getting three
or four hours of sleep a day.

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,260
When she suffers from a lack of sleep

80
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
it destroys her temperament.

81
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,780
Right, right.

82
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,980
When is the demo seminar?

83
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,420
I think it's on Friday.

84
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,180
My heart almost jumped out of my mouth.

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,940
Xing Yun's becoming more and more assscious.

86
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,860
You Planning Department guys need to be clear,

87
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,300
is it the color that doesn't work or the style?

88
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
How much clearer can I be?

89
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,660
I've told you, the biggest problem
is that it's ugly.

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,460
Can you planners think with your head for once?

91
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,580
What's ugly? What's beautiful?

92
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,660
What's new? What's old?

93
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,820
Can you give me a clear definition?

94
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,700
Alright, stop arguing.

95
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,500
Maggie, I don't think this version

96
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,980
really works either.

97
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
How about this,

98
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,860
the Planning Department will revise
its requirements further,

99
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,380
and give you something more specific.

100
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,460
Xing Yun, you came from the Arts Unit too.

101
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,580
You naturally take their side.

102
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,660
If you want to revise the requirements,
revise them yourself.

103
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,740
OK, I'll change it.

104
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,300
Maggie, when can we have the UI ready

105
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,060
for the Programming Department?

106
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,020
They don't come to meetings
even when they can.

107
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,580
Why should I give them the UI?

108
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,260
Where are you going?

109
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,540
I have work to catch up.

110
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,980
I'll spare myself the trouble of staying here.

111
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,340
Perfect.

112
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,900
I don't want to waste time either.

113
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,340
We're going.

114
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,500
Wait, don't go.

115
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,100
Stay, stay and discuss it.

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,620
Hu! Hu!

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,780
What is it?

118
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,500
Why weren't you at the meeting just now?

119
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,260
I didn't have time.

120
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,380
There's still a lot of problems

121
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,620
I want to discuss with you.

122
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,100
This achievement system

123
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,020
needs three or four more event triggers.

124
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,180
Have you seen the email I sent you?

125
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,060
That can't be done.

126
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,740
Don't be so quick to turn me down.

127
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,500
If there's any difficulties

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,900
we can go over them together to solve them.

129
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,580
Xing Yun, right?

130
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,660
We're not only providing services

131
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,300
for this Instance Zones project of yours.

132
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,100
All the functions you want to add,

133
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,020
they don't fit in the modules,
so it'd have to be done from scratch.

134
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,420
It's a waste of time and energy,
and it would create leaks.

135
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,140
It just can't be done.

136
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,100
Please, just help me with this again.

137
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,780
Get the Arts Unit
to push the UI forward two weeks

138
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,820
and then we can talk.

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,740
I've looked at the numbers.

140
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,660
Judging by the schedule,

141
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,820
we should be able to finish it in time.

142
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,500
What numbers?

143
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,740
Once you learned some basic code

144
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,660
you can then bring your requests to me.

145
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,780
Eh!

146
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,220
My daughter, you've been working overtime
for a whole week.

147
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,580
Can you come home earlier today?

148
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,420
What's going on?

149
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,940
Get in. It's raining.

150
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,460
Thank you, Mr. Xia, but that's OK.

151
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,500
It isn’t raining where I live.

152
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,460
My bus's here. See you, Mr. Xia.

153
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,260
Idiot.

154
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,900
Hello?

155
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,780
Wait, I need to get off here.

156
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,220
Mr. Xia, what do you need at this late hour?

157
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,580
Have you arrived home?

158
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,220
Do you need something from me or not?

159
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,180
The demo's progress is going slow.

160
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,540
Schedule a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss it.

161
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,620
Understood.

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,020
What are you, a vampire?

163
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,340
You can't even let me go at midnight.

164
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,420
Rotten, amoral capitalist.

165
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,300
Xia, the Facist! Xia, the Flayer!

166
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,420
I'm telling you,

167
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,420
I should just let you disappear on your way home.

168
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,220
Look at this noob.

169
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
This person has no skill, you know?

170
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
Hu, sorry to bother you.

171
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,420
What is it?

172
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,580
I just wanted to discuss

173
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,260
the automatic voice chat function with you.

174
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,180
I've looked at that.

175
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,620
If the player presses the button,

176
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,060
it's not automatic voice chat.

177
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Do you want to lose some functionality?

178
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,460
Yes.

179
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,260
If the text and voice chat

180
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,820
aren't in the same channel,
do you want to lose text chat?

181
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,660
Yes.

182
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,940
You have to make these details clear

183
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,300
in the case.

184
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,700
I put them in there.

185
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,300
Put them in again.

186
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,700
They don't make sense as they are.

187
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,020
You'd better make a flowchart.

188
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,300
That's all.

189
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,340
OK, then I'll hurry back and change them.

190
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,300
That girl will get dizzy

191
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,580
if you keep sending her back and forth like this.

192
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,500
Have you ever seen such a young planner before?

193
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,100
Let me tell you, a planner like that,

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,980
will always come out with whatever nonsense
is on their mind.

195
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
If I don't give her an example of
how it's done at the start

196
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
she'll drive me crazy with her nonsense.

197
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,380
Very clever.

198
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,060
Mr. Xia.

199
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,620
Mr. Xia.

200
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,220
Show me her case details.

201
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,620
OK.

202
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,300
Here, this page.

203
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Mr. Xia.

204
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,540
Enter.

205
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
You wanted to see me?

206
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,780
Come here.

207
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,500
What is it?

208
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,100
Less nonsense. Hurry up.

209
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
For my next project,

210
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,740
I'm planning some research into this type of game.

211
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm looking for someone to help me research it.

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,700
First, I'm very busy.

213
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,460
Second, I don't even know how to play it.

214
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,260
Third, you should find a guy to play it with you.

215
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,740
Hu from the Programming Department is good.

216
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,300
Fourth...

217
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
Fourth, it would seem to be me

218
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,900
who pays your wages.

219
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,260
OK.

220
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,740
Time for your medicine.

221
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,540
Miss, can I have one less pill tonight?

222
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,380
Just one.

223
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,260
That won't do.

224
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,340
These pills

225
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,980
will help you get back into good health.

226
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,340
If you don't take them all,

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,700
my boss will find out.

228
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,900
She'll tell me off.

229
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,980
She won't.

230
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,700
I won't tell the doctor.

231
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,300
This will be our secret.

232
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,940
Scout's honor!

233
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,500
I already know.

234
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,580
Doctor.

235
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,940
How's he behaving?

236
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,580
Has he caused any trouble?

237
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,300
He's much more flexible than before.

238
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,300
Where's his mother?

239
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,180
She had something to attend to for the moment.

240
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,020
She asked us on the graveyard shift
to look after him.

241
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,580
Doctor, why's your hair all crooked?

242
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,380
I just performed surgery. The hat messed it up.

243
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,740
Where'd this come from?

244
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,860
My mom bought this for me.

245
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,740
It's gone cold, it’s not tasty anymore.

246
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,300
What sort of a mother behaves like this,

247
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,980
leaving their child alone here

248
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,300
and buying all this junk food for them!

249
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,820
Doctor, it's not my mom's fault.

250
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,220
My mom works hard to take care of me.

251
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,740
You are quite mature.

252
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Tao, bring my dinner over.

253
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,860
OK.

254
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,180
Sweet and sour pork ribs!

255
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,580
I'd better eat this up.

256
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,380
Delicious!

257
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,140
Take your time, don't eat it like a dog.

258
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,940
Go left.

259
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,980
Left!

260
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,340
Get up this wall.

261
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,740
Throw a grenade. Throw a grenade!

262
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,220
Throw...

263
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,940
Grenade! Grenade!

264
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,980
Where, where's the grenade?

265
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,940
Seventy five degrees. Seventy five degrees.

266
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,580
Girls just aren't

267
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
this game's target players.

268
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,700
And I'm no good at shooting games anyway.

269
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,740
You should find someone else.

270
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm telling you, this isn't a gender issue.

271
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,900
It's an IQ issue.

272
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,180
Mr. Xia,

273
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,100
you don't have to come up with so many ways

274
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,220
to personally attack me.

275
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,420
From now on, every day at lunch and after work,

276
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,460
come here to practice for an hour.

277
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,100
And keep practicing until you're proficient.

278
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,620
You played so much
that it gave you tendonitis.

279
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,260
Does this count as a work injury?

280
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,220
I had to do everything
just to reach my current rank.

281
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,180
He barely did anything
and is already ranked grand master.

282
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,740
You know, as a boss,

283
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,220
doesn't he do anything he's supposed to all day?

284
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,220
What video game company has a boss
that isn't a gaming expert?

285
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,860
Based on Mr. Xia's IQ,

286
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,500
he should be three ranks above you
with only an hour's play time.

287
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,940
You think my IQ's the problem too?

288
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,900
Of course not. Come on!

289
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,380
Here, put on this ointment.

290
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,340
I don't need it. It smells strong.

291
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,740
Suit yourself.

292
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,900
So,

293
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,060
how's the project been going lately?

294
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,620
Hu's scrutiny as the lead programmer

295
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,540
is impenetrable.

296
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,780
He's even made my requirements

297
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,780
a low priority.

298
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,460
And with Maggie stalling
as the Arts Unit's lead,

299
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,140
she's even turned around and thrown accusations at me.

300
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,620
What did she accuse me of? Being ungrateful!

301
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,740
And then there's those of you
in the Planning Department.

302
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,660
They think I'll be replaced sooner or later.

303
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,100
The commitment just isn't there.

304
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,580
Alright, if I weren't so busy

305
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,740
dealing with the core issues

306
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,660
I'd definitely apply to come and help you out.

307
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,300
Let me blow on your hand for you.

308
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,820
Xing Yun, stop eating.

309
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,100
We're having a big meal for dinner.

310
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,340
What big meal?

311
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,940
Email! Check your email.

312
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,500
Hurry up.

313
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,980
Notice: The Instance Zones Project Team
will be having dinner together.

314
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,140
Tonight?

315
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,660
Yeah, I just made reservations
at a high-end restaurant.

316
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,380
Why wasn't I caught up on such good news?

317
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,780
This won't do. I have to apply

318
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,380
for a transfer to your department
so I can enjoy this meal too.

319
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,300
The project hasn't made any progress at all.

320
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,540
Why are we all having dinner together
all of a sudden?

321
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,180
Is it some sort of ruse?

322
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm not going.

323
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,860
Don't reply.

324
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,740
Mr. Xia said that attendance is mandatory.

325
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,620
Mr. Xia, our project has only just started,

326
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,020
and you've brought us to such a great restaurant
to have dinner together.

327
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,300
Have you had some sort of pleasant surprise?

328
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,060
With development progressing so slowly,

329
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,420
the only thing on her mind is eating.

330
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,060
So, this was Xing Yun's idea?

331
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,580
With the way we've been treating her,

332
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
she still suggested we all have dinner together.

333
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,060
We should be grateful to Xing Yun

334
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,380
for helping us get such a sumptuous meal

335
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,700
together with Mr. Xia.

336
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,340
Right?

337
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,860
Right!

338
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,380
Xing Yun, thank you.

339
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,700
Thank you, Xing Yun.

340
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,420
Cheers.

341
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,460
Cheers.

342
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
It, it's nothing.

343
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,580
Everyone's been working hard.

344
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,060
When did I request that we have dinner together?

345
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,700
Send the fish this way.

346
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,140
Here, here.

347
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,420
Hu, here.

348
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,020
Have some.

349
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,900
Tuck in.

350
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,340
I guarantee I'll get 5 kills today, you know.

351
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,900
You guys don't need to put in such a performance

352
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,460
for the boss's sake.

353
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,580
What do you know?

354
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,660
This is what we programmers always do.

355
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,900
It's not a meal if we don't play a game
straight after it.

356
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,300
Right!

357
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,900
Here, here.

358
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,380
Here, here.

359
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,460
Mr. Xia, play with us.

360
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm not very good.

361
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,900
Fraud.

362
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Let Xing Yun play with you.

363
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,740
She usually carries me if I do play.

364
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,340
Xing Yun?

365
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,420
Nice, Xing Yun!

366
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,580
I, I rarely see girls playing this game.

367
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,380
Try this. Let's see how you play.

368
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,140
OK.

369
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,460
OK. Let's all play together.

370
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,420
Let's go.

371
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,940
OK, let's start.

372
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,340
Jump!

373
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,180
Nicely done, Xing Yun!

374
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,900
Over here, this way.

375
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,860
I took a head shot.

376
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,820
Well done, Xing Yun.

377
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,940
Awesome, Xing Yun!

378
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
I never knew that.

379
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
I have to say something.

380
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,540
A toast to Xing Yun.

381
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,620
Xing Yun's got real skill.

382
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,220
So, a toast to you.

383
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,900
I always thought you were soft and delicate

384
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,580
like those other girls.

385
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,220
But you're actually a hard nut to crack.

386
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,380
It's nothing.

387
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,540
I still lack experience.

388
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,380
I could still really benefit
from your help and guidance, Hu.

389
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,460
Seeing you enjoy this game so much,

390
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,740
shows that you enjoy this industry.

391
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,740
We should play together often in future,

392
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,380
and interact more and get to know each other.

393
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,060
That way, we can all work well together.

394
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,620
Am I right?

395
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,980
Then, a toast to you guys.

396
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,420
OK.

397
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,860
Here, here.

398
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,620
Cheers!

399
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,860
Cheers, cheers.

400
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,540
Cheers.

401
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,140
Stop making excuses.

402
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,620
We're going, Xing Yun.

403
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,540
Time to go home. Bye-bye.

404
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,140
Bye-bye.

405
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,140
Bye-bye. Take care on the road.

406
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,980
Bye-bye.

407
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,020
Mr. Xia, why haven't you gone home yet?

408
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,260
I'm waiting here for my driver.

409
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,700
Well, I'll be going.

410
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,540
Hold it.

411
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,540
Is it appropriate to make your boss

412
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,420
wait here alone?

413
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,740
Come on, take a walk with me.

414
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,900
If you want to say thanks, just say it.
Don't be reticent.

415
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,460
Thanks for today.

416
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:17,940
Thanks for what?

417
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
I didn't figure it out until today

418
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,340
that the reason you had me practice
playing the game

419
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,660
and arrange dinner for everyone

420
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,460
was to help me build rapport with everyone.

421
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,140
So long as you know.

422
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,940
Couldn't you have just explained to me
what you were doing?

423
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,900
You know,

424
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,220
you're never willing to say what's on your mind,

425
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,180
you always talk in code.

426
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,380
You want to do something good,

427
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,900
but it ends up being mistaken for something bad.

428
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,380
Do you always say what you mean?

429
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,660
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,940
At least now things are clear between us.

431
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,820
I just don't understand.

432
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,060
I'd already prepared such detailed

433
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,300
variable charts and requirements,

434
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,580
but I had to win three matches in a game

435
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,860
to get in the good graces of the programmers.

436
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,820
Were they intentionally making things hard for me?

437
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,420
The situation itself here

438
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,820
isn't entirely your fault.

439
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,180
The Planning Department needs

440
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,020
to gain the trust of the other departments
to get things done.

441
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,580
But, they hadn't done that.

442
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,700
Then, what am I supposed to do

443
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,260
to gain everyone's trust?

444
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,300
Do I need to minimize the revision requirements?

445
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,020
Improving requirements is
a perfectly normal thing to do.

446
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,740
There isn't anyone

447
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,820
who can predict things with 100% accuracy.

448
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,500
But, you must be clear on the thoughts
that you have.

449
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,780
You can't follow your feelings,

450
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,020
otherwise how would you find
what other people want?

451
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,020
What you need to do

452
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,340
is consider what other people want
from their perspective.

453
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,900
You don't understand.

454
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,580
I do. I feel like being angry with you recently

455
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
was especially childish of me.

456
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,140
I should have asked for your advice sooner,

457
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,660
then I wouldn't have had
to make so many detours,

458
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,420
which was exhausting.

459
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,180
So long as you know.

460
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,300
I know.

461
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,740
My driver's here. I'll send you home.

462
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,660
That's OK. I'll take the bus.

463
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,340
There are still buses at this hour.

464
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,100
If you take the bus will you sleep
and miss your stop again?

465
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,900
How did you know about that?

466
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,940
Have you been following me?

467
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm not that bored.

468
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,820
It must be a coincidence.

469
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,820
Let's go, I'll give you a ride home

470
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,540
Hi, mom.

471
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,500
I had dinner with some colleagues today
so I'm running late.

472
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,860
I'll be home soon.

473
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,820
Don't worry.

474
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,380
Chu, Chu Nan?

475
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,980
We're fine. Don't start speculating.

476
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,460
I'm in his car right now.

477
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,220
He's sending me home.

478
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,140
Don't worry.

479
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,580
Bye-bye.

480
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,540
So, you still haven't told your mom

481
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,740
that you and Chu Nan broke up.

482
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
I just don't want her to worry.

483
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,020
Besides, if my dad finds out we broke up,

484
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,980
he'll try to settle a score with Chu Nan.

485
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,420
Chu Nan and Shen Qing are truly in love.

486
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,340
Chu Nan's mother

487
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,220
already has trouble accepting Shen Qing.

488
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,580
If my dad goes and sticks his nose in at this time,

489
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,900
they'll add to the list of people
venting at Shen Qing.

490
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,180
That would make things worse for Chu Nan.

491
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,860
You still care about him quite a bit.

492
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,180
So, since the beginning,

493
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,620
you've had no resentment towards Chu Nan,

494
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,620
but you've saved all your resentment for me.

495
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,460
I, I haven't! Why would I?

496
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,100
Actually, I do quite resent him.

497
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,420
Stop the car up ahead.

498
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,940
OK.

499
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,860
Mr. Xia, this is two stops away from my house.

500
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
No, Mr. Xia!

501
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,700
Mr. Xia!

502
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,580
You don't get tired working every day,

503
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,020
and you're even watching the door here.

504
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,060
Are things clear between you and Xing Yun now?

505
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,260
Xing Yun's giving this back to you.

506
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,880
Xing Yun is a good girl,

507
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,460
and you hurt her.

508
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,660
What do you plan to do now?

509
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,980
Do you have to go after that one inside, there?

510
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,560
I can't face her.

511
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,700
I don't deserve her.

512
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
Nonsense.

513
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,420
Shen Qing is divorced,

514
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,840
but she's never done anything wrong.

515
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm the one who's weak and contemptible.

516
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,500
Whether it's Shen Qing or Xing Yun,

517
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,460
I don't deserve either of them.

518
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,580
I didn't want to force you,

519
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,620
and I certainly didn't want to force you
to become like this.

520
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,740
Xiaoxi's being discharged tomorrow.

521
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,560
In future, whatever goes on between you two,

522
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,020
will be none of my business.

523
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,700
Mr. Xia, Mr. Sun is here.

524
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,060
Mr. Xia.

525
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,580
Mr. Sun.

526
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,900
Let me introduce you.

527
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,460
This is Jack.

528
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,140
He's been working abroad.

529
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,260
I just poached him from another company.

530
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,060
He specializes in video game evaluation.

531
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,260
I was just passing by here today

532
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,660
and thought he could give us some suggestions

533
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,700
on our Instance Zones project.

534
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,620
Nice to meet you.

535
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,260
Nice to meet you.

536
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,460
I know it's a surprise,

537
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,140
but I remember you saying

538
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,540
that the person in charge of the project

539
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,380
is passionate about video games.

540
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,900
It shouldn't be a problem, presumably.

541
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,060
Yes, that's right.

542
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,260
Let's step into the conference room.

543
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,780
OK.

544
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:28,980
This way.

545
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,300
Bringing someone to evaluate

546
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,460
without even giving us time to prepare.

547
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
Is he deliberately trying to catch us unawares?

548
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,060
Where's Xing Yun?

549
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,580
Xing Yun is in the smaller conference room.

550
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,820
She's holding a meeting with the music producers.

551
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,620
Xing Yun?

552
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,660
This is the person in charge
that you gave an unorthodox promotion to?

553
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,460
Yes.

554
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Where is she? Let's go see her.

555
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,020
OK, this way.

556
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,120
Your video games really appeal to women after all.

557
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,380
Mr. Sun. Mr. Xia.

558
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,020
Mr. Sun wants to take a look

559
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,260
at the current project's development.

560
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,380
Right now?

561
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,020
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

562
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,900
No.

563
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,340
Amy, take Mr. Sun to the conference room.

564
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,260
Mr. Sun, this way.

565
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,620
OK.

566
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,820
Get ready.

567
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,540
Don't be nervous. I'll help you pad things out.

568
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,060
OK, I'll just get a cab back.

569
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,980
The world doesn't revolve around you, Mr. Xia.

570
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,980
I'll just call a cab for me and Xiaoxi.

571
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,900
Dad!

572
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,340
Shen Xiaoxi, don't call him that.

573
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,020
Chu Nan.

574
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,380
Mr. Ling, here's the result of the DNA test.

575
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,420
Shen Xiaoxi is your biological son.

576
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,540
Thank you.

577
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,660
You don't have to do this.

578
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,420
I'll call for a home service.

579
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,780
With Xiaoxi back,

580
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,980
how can you manage on your own?

581
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,980
You need to find a nanny for him.

582
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,600
I'll ask around to find out who's reliable.

583
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,060
Chu Nan, you know

584
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,420
that I've never been one to need
other people to look after me.

585
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Yes, you don't need others to look after you.

586
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,740
You always keep your feelings locked up inside,

587
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,460
scared that other people might see you as vulnerable.

588
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,080
Now, I don't even have the right
to show concern for you?

589
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,940
Is that it?

590
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Shen Qing, I know that you can't tolerate

591
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,580
that I was involved with Xing Yun.

592
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,300
I also know that you can't

593
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,180
stand me now.

594
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
But, I know what I did was wrong.

595
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,140
I really know that what I did was wrong.

596
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,020
It's because of this that I understand

597
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,380
that I can't lose you.

598
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,980
We

599
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,860
can't be together.

600
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,100
I don't believe that!

601
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,900
You clearly still care about me.

602
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,700
If my mother bothers you,

603
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,660
she told me that

604
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,420
it, it's none of her business.

605
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,500
Chu Nan, I have a son too.

606
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,340
If he hurt someone else

607
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,300
for his own happiness one day,

608
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,020
how do you think I'd react?

609
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,900
It's not that it's none of your mother's business,

610
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,340
it's that she doesn't want any part of it.
Do you understand?

611
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,980
She saved Shen Xiaoxi's leg.

612
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,100
No matter how little I understand
about the world,

613
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,940
I know

614
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,620
why a specialist like your mother

615
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,220
would go to so much effort

616
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
to save Shen Xiaoxi.

617
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,860
It's because she doesn't want me
to be involved with her son.

618
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,740
She wants me to owe her,

619
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,100
and it's a debt I could never pay back.

620
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,180
You know

621
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,620
that the thing I'm least willing to tolerate

622
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,660
is being in debt to another person.

623
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,820
So, the only thing I can do

624
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,220
is give her back her son.

625
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,060
Thank you for sending me home today.

626
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,980
I know that everyone's been hurt here.

627
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,940
Don't worry,

628
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,740
I won't do anything so stupid again.

629
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,220
I will wait for you.

630
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,980
I'm quite satisfied

631
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,880
with the current development.

632
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,300
But of course, the quicker the better.

633
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,740
Yes.

634
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,100
Xing Yun, right?

635
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,580
You're more capable than I'd imagined.

636
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,460
Keep up the hard work.

637
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,780
Thanks for the compliment, Mr. Sun.

638
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,940
I'll be waiting to hear some good news for you.

639
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,700
Mr. Sun.

640
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,460
OK.

641
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,060
You performed well.

642
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,980
Are you complimenting me?

643
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,140
Actually, I was really nervous.

644
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
What you did to pad things out was better.

645
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,940
You were fearless.

646
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,780
But, Mr. Xia, you just said

647
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,500
that the company has been promoting
self-improved health.

648
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,060
What was that about only drinking plain water?

649
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,580
I recall that Mr. Sun

650
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,740
prefers drinking dragon well tea.

651
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,260
It's his own fault for holding me up.

652
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,220
Are you talking about Xiaoxi being discharged
from the hospital?

653
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,020
Don't worry.

654
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,380
Chu Nan has already sent them home.

655
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,300
You and he are still in close contact, I see.

656
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,060
We're not. Why would I contact him?

657
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,220
Xiaoxi told me.

658
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,580
So, Mr. Xia, we passed

659
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,900
Mr. Sun's spot-check.

660
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,540
If you have no further instructions
for today,

661
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,780
can I finish work early?

662
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,780
Do you have a date?

663
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,780
Who would I have a date with?

664
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,660
I've just been working 24/7

665
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,220
for quite a while already.

666
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,300
I just want to get some sleep.

667
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,460
What I mean by 12/7

668
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,100
is 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.

669
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,420
So, you're accusing me.

670
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
Well...

671
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,140
Go on.

672
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,820
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

673
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,380
I can't believe Mr. Xia has shown mercy on you

674
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,220
and let you finish work early today.

675
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,780
Let's go shopping.

676
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,260
I don't want to.

677
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,460
I just want to get home
to my bed and comic books.

678
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,700
You're showing your true colors as a nerd again.

679
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,780
Right?

680
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,460
My true colors are always showing. You see?

681
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,060
Xing Yun!

682
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,940
Xing Cheng?

683
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,540
Who's that?

684
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,460
My cousin.

685
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,300
Xing Cheng.

686
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
What are you doing here?

687
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,380
Xing Yun, I'll be going.

688
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,460
OK, see you tomorrow.

689
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,020
Bye-bye.

690
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,740
Xing Cheng, what's the matter?

691
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,380
Xing Yun, I'm so upset.

692
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,260
What happened to you?

693
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,860
You haven't fallen out
with your new husband, have you?

694
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,460
My marriage is in perfect working order.

695
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,220
Then, why are you upset?

696
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm upset for you.

697
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,780
Why did you hide the fact that

698
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,100
you and Chu Nan broke up from me?

699
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,700
How did you know about that?

700
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,860
I had to go to that bank today

701
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,660
and found out there that you two had broken up.

702
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,020
What did he say about our breaking up?

703
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,860
He said he treated you poorly,

704
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,860
and that it was all his fault.

705
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,940
I didn't have time to ask him about the details

706
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,580
before his boss at the bank dragged him away.

707
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,380
When you are you going to stop

708
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,140
overreacting to small problems so much?

709
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,140
Xing Yun, tell me,

710
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,740
did he meet someone else?

711
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,700
Didn't he even propose to you?

712
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,380
You know, there really isn't anyway

713
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,860
to separate dirt bags
from the crowd these days.

714
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,140
Xing Yun, you must be upset right now.

715
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,700
You're silently suffering a breakup

716
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,540
and even putting on a brave face.

717
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,460
Alright, you can drop the act.

718
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,060
You didn't tell my parents

719
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,420
that we broke up, did you?

720
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,860
I don't want them to worry.

721
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,940
You can't keep this sort of thing locked up inside.

722
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,740
It will cause depression
if you don't let it out.

723
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,380
You'll become mentally ill.

724
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,780
I've already made a date with your parents.

725
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,820
We can get together and let everything out.

726
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,300
Come on.

727
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,780
Where are we going?

728
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,540
...good night.

729
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,020
Sleep soundly.

730
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,540
So, baby, have a good night.

731
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,980
An enchanting smile.

732
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,940
So, baby, have a good night.

733
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,180
Have a good night.

734
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,420
So, baby, have a good night.

735
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,060
Have a good night.

736
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,500
Raising the corners of your mouth.

737
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,940
So, baby, have a good night.

738
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,340
What a wonderful feeling.

739
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,060
So, baby, have a good night.

740
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,660
Have a good night.
So, baby, have a good night.

741
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,740
If I knew this would happen
I'd have stayed at work.

742
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,100
She won't even let me
have the microphone and sing.

743
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,580
Exactly which one of us here has broken up?

744
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,740
How did I fall asleep?

745
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,540
Xing Cheng?

746
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,940
Xing Cheng?

747
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,100
Where is she?

748
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,820
Xing Cheng?

749
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,060
Xing Cheng?

750
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,980
Where'd she go?

751
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,860
What's going on? She ran off.

752
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,220
You've come to sing alone.

753
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,580
Who, who are you?

754
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,860
It's so boring alone.

755
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,340
Come to my room and sing. Let's go.

756
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,420
You, you want me to sing with you?

757
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Yeah, one person...

758
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,220
Hello?

759
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,580
Xia Ke, I'm going to die.

760
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,700
I got hit, hit, hit, hit in the head.

761
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,140
A woman hit me in the head.

762
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
Such is life. I'm hanging up.

763
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,780
Wait. Come, come to the hospital right now.

764
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,260
You know, you have to take responsibility
in this matter.

765
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,300
It was your woman who hit me in the head.

766
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,740
I lost enough blood to fill a swimming pool.

767
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,420
Don't you have anything better to do?

768
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,300
It really was your woman who hit me.

769
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,580
The woman from your company.

770
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,940
That something, something mascot something.

771
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,700
Xing something or other.

772
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,060
Do you mean Xing Yun?

773
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,580
Yeah, that's her.

774
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,460
Xing Yun, clocking on.

775
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,340
This is earliest you've clocked on

776
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,580
in a year.

777
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,980
Who'd put this Easter egg here?

778
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,380
Mr. Xia is such a bore.

779
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,740
Mr. Xia, good morning!

780
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,140
This clocking machine is amazing.

781
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,380
It just complimented me.

782
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,940
You're here early.

783
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Morning exercises.

784
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,780
It was on the way, so I came into the office.

785
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,300
If I had time to go home first

786
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,460
I wouldn't have come so early.

787
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,580
I need to order breakfast.

788
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,340
Where's my phone?

789
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,820
Hello, is that Karaoke Joy?

790
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,660
I was the guest in Room 915 last night.

791
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,100
I can't find my phone.

792
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,340
Can you help me check

793
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,460
if it's in the room?

794
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:14,940
OK.

795
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,800
It's not?

796
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,860
Got it.

797
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,540
Well, if you find it, please contact me.

798
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,460
Thank you.

799
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,500
No way!

800
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,100
The instant noodles and potato chips
have all disappeared.

801
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,100
Fried pancake!

802
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,380
Eat up.

803
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,940
Eat up.

804
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,140
One bite, and I know

805
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,900
it's from the Han pancake place on the corner.

806
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,780
Why's Mr. Xia in the office so early?

807
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,700
And, he brought me breakfast.

808
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,220
It must be coincidence.

809
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,700
He must have bought this
but didn't like it,

810
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,540
so he's given it to me.

811
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,020
That must be it.

812
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,660
Don't worry. He doesn't appreciate you,

813
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,100
but I do.

814
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,100
Soy milk!

815
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,900
The Jiawo project manager is coming

816
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,180
next Monday to work here for a couple days

817
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,900
and gather some resources.

818
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,620
The Promotion Department will be following.

819
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,380
The Instance Zones Project Team
should do the utmost to cooperate.

820
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,220
Amy, prepare a private office

821
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,540
for Mr. He from Jiawo,

822
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,620
and make sure it has a mini-fridge

823
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,780
with cola and Perrier water.

824
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,460
OK.

825
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,260
Have it ready by next Friday.

826
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,940
Didn't you say he'd be here on Monday?

827
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,740
I don't think he'll arrive so soon.

828
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,780
He has some private business
that is un...finished.

829
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,180
Oh, we're finished. Thanks, everyone.

830
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,380
So, we're not finished. Sorry, I heard wrong.

831
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,380
That'll be all.

832
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,100
Xing Yun, stay behind.

833
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,620
You didn't sleep well yesterday.

834
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,380
Kind of.

835
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,220
It seems working 12/7

836
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,780
is a better fit for you.

837
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,740
I guess so.

838
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,580
They say home is where the heart is.

839
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,980
I feel like the office is my home.

840
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,260
I won't leave early again.

841
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,940
Sorry, Mr. Xia.

842
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,860
I shouldn't have slept through the meeting.

843
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,900
Your voice is so hypnotic.

844
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,140
Get some sleep on the sofa.

845
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,740
Is this sarcasm?

846
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,380
Are you testing me?

847
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,420
Seeing your sleepless face
makes me uncomfortable.

848
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,580
Then, I'm very sorry.

849
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,340
Are you going to sleep or not?

850
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,420
I am, I am.

851
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,540
It smells comfortable.

852
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,580
It looks like you slack off often.
