1
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:52,530
=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,620
=Episode 22=

3
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,450
I admit that

4
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,850
it's tastier than Japanese food charging
several hundred yuan per person on the average.

5
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,450
Sure enough, these hot homemade dishes

6
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,500
warm our hearts most when we work overtime.

7
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,530
Come on, here come beers.

8
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,980
Beers and spicy crayfish match best.

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,620
Come on, share it.

10
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,500
Mr. Xia, you're really good at shelling crayfish.

11
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,900
What are you thinking?

12
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,370
I think since that dating is

13
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,700
the theme of Instance Zones,

14
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,980
can we design a module

15
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,340
enabling couples in real life

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,340
to join us?

17
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,900
Go ahead.

18
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,810
Infinite,

19
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,500
a game aiming at female,

20
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,980
can only attract female players.

21
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,060
If two people can operate

22
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,650
and complete a task

23
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,860
on one cell phone simultaneously,

24
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,810
will that attract couple players?

25
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,450
Playing on one cell phone

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,730
can increase physical intimacy.

27
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,370
It also requires cooperation between players,

28
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,370
which will be a test on tacit understanding.

29
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,860
Ball.

30
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,090
Right. That's a good idea.

31
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,900
Previously, I think ball module

32
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,650
was quite simple.

33
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,290
It should be better now.

34
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,220
But won't it be too late

35
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,010
to change now?

36
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,650
Try and we'll know.

37
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,010
Amy, go.

38
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,700
Be careful.

39
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,930
Hurry up. Give me a hand.

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,900
Come on.

41
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,060
Well, Mr. Xia.

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,900
OK. Well.

43
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,620
Are you all right?

44
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,100
Hello.

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,250
He Yu.

46
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,660
Do you also like this picture?

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
A lonely wild duck flies with the sunset clouds;

48
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,730
the autumn river mirrors the color of the sky.

49
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,340
Madam, Painter Cheng said

50
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,970
the painting was just sold.

51
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,690
It just hasn't been marked yet.

52
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,010
Do you want to buy this painting?

53
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,340
I can give it up to you.

54
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,100
That will be embarrassing.

55
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,660
So we can be friends.

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,850
Hello, I'm Zhang Sirui.

57
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,290
Fang Ling.

58
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,780
You're Xia Ke's grandma.

59
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,730
You are...

60
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,620
My former name was Zhang Rui.

61
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm Xia Ke's...

62
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,340
I didn't expect to see you here.

63
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,850
Actually, I don't believe in coincidence,

64
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,900
but I don't hate smart people.

65
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,340
Now that you've parted,

66
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,730
what are you going to do with me?

67
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,620
Back then we broke up for Xia Ke.

68
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,690
Because it's nothing glorious,

69
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,540
nobody knows it.

70
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,660
I, I have claustrophobia.

71
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,900
It was getting worse and worse in those years.

72
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,690
I couldn't fall asleep with lights off.

73
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,410
Also, I couldn't go

74
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,250
anywhere a little dark.

75
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,940
I really didn't want him

76
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,820
to suffer such an abnormal life with me.

77
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,690
So I left him

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,010
and went abroad alone for medical treatment.

79
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,380
You should tell him that.

80
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,940
I also want to,

81
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
but he's been angry with me.

82
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,570
And some misunderstandings won't be

83
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,570
cleared with just a few words.

84
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,450
So you want me to help

85
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,100
clear your misunderstandings.

86
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:00,850
Yes.

87
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,100
Let's help each other.

88
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,940
I think you want Xia Ke to return to the Xia Family

89
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,940
and share the joy of family with you.

90
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,100
When you're free, come and make tea with me.

91
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,100
Now that you gave up the painting to me,

92
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,940
come to my home when you want to see it.

93
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,250
Thank you, Grandma.

94
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,170
You learned art,

95
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,410
so you should have a good taste.

96
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Give me some advice.

97
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm looking for a gift.

98
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,570
Whom do you want to give the gift to?

99
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,060
Xia Ke's grandma.

100
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,660
Are you familiar with her?

101
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,500
Don't get me wrong. It's just a regular visit.

102
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,970
How about a shawl?

103
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,250
Nowadays, cool air is everywhere like in the subway.

104
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,220
She can take it with her at all times.

105
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,540
It's light.

106
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,060
How expensive it is!

107
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,730
I remember Link's purse

108
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,900
on the show the other day

109
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,690
was quite beautiful.

110
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,340
Wait a minute.

111
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,490
By the way,

112
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,100
share these shawls with your colleagues.

113
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,660
Thank you for shopping with me today.

114
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,130
How grand it was!

115
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,660
She didn't invite you to go shopping.

116
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,370
Obviously, she displayed her strength.

117
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,300
She just wanted to tell you

118
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,450
you are in different worlds.

119
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,220
Is there a shawl for me?

120
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,660
What are you doing?

121
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,220
Of course I refused.

122
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,220
What? What a pity!

123
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,050
But I'm not surprised that

124
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,220
she did such a thing.

125
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,660
I've got her background clearly.

126
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,370
She is the illegitimate daughter of Zhang's Group.

127
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,900
Like a distressed princess,

128
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,660
she has no power or status in their family.

129
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,540
However, I admit that she is capable and talented,

130
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,450
or she won't make such achievement today.

131
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,930
But in any case, she has no need to visit

132
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,980
Mr. Xia's grandma at home.

133
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,810
How about asking Mr. Xia?

134
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,540
Shall I?

135
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,220
No.

136
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,540
He did nothing out of line.

137
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,780
What's most annoying about women

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,900
in love is being suspicious.

139
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,010
I'll give you a summary

140
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,180
of the current situation.

141
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,980
First, she is closely

142
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,740
related to Mr. Xia.

143
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,100
Second, in my opinion, she likes Mr. Xia.

144
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,660
Third, she is so excellent that

145
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,900
she seems to attract any man

146
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,050
without doing anything.

147
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,900
Fourth, Mr. Xia was as cold to her as to others.

148
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,780
But if the situation goes on like this,

149
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,050
then

150
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,220
we can't tell what will happen.

151
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,220
Fifth, as the current leader of the appraisal group,

152
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,610
she grasps the lifeblood of TIG.

153
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,220
If something happens,

154
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,220
Mr. Xia will surely tell you in advance.

155
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,860
Now that he acts as if nothing happens now,

156
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,010
it shows that nothing goes wrong.

157
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
Nonsense.

158
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,480
(Reply at once)

159
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,740
The number you've dialed is busy.

160
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,420
Hello, Mr. An.

161
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,660
Xia Ke, you're here.

162
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,610
Why are you here?

163
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,220
I asked her to come here.

164
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,130
I heard that grandma likes calla lily,

165
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,370
so I specially asked someone

166
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,250
to send a box of rare orange calla lily
from the Netherlands.

167
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,130
Grandma, Xia Ke is allergic to pollen.

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,570
I'll move it over there.

169
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,660
Don't you wonder how we know each other?

170
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,180
It's quite normal for you

171
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,980
to know people around me.

172
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,810
It's OK that you said she is someone around you.

173
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,540
We're working together now.

174
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,450
That's all.

175
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,010
What do you want me to do?

176
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,570
Can't I ask you here for nothing?

177
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,010
Aunt Zhang came back.

178
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,660
What?

179
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,660
She is busy making

180
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,100
Glutinous Rice Balls
in Fermented Rice Wine you like

181
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,300
and mango soup you like best in the kitchen.

182
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,220
Grandma, when we were in Britain,

183
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,250
on one occasion Xia Ke suddenly wanted
to eat mango soup,

184
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,010
we searched around with him.

185
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,810
After tasting in several shops,

186
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,220
finally he found

187
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,810
the satisfying mango soup in a dessert shop

188
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,180
run by the Chinese people.

189
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,130
Finally, we see the original version today.

190
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,450
Sirui is good at cooking.

191
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,490
You'll learn how to make it soon.

192
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
You ate all the desserts I brought you.

193
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,900
I specially made it low-sugar for you

194
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,690
and was afraid that it wouldn't be tasty enough.

195
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,010
Call Shen Qing here next weekend.

196
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,300
Sirui makes more snacks,

197
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,220
so we can have afternoon tea together.

198
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,780
Xia Ke, you're old enough.

199
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,980
When to get married?

200
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,450
You're planning again.

201
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,980
What I want actually is very simple.

202
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,610
I just want your wife to be equal
in social status,

203
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,100
kind and good to you.

204
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,570
Sure enough,

205
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,930
if you can find a girl better than that,

206
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,900
I'll have no objection.

207
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,900
Grandma, when will you stop posing

208
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,050
as if you have everything in control?

209
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,010
I have something to deal with.

210
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,130
I'll visit you another day.

211
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,540
Grandma, don't be angry.

212
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,340
I know he's still mad at me.

213
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,740
Because I first left him back then.

214
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,570
You should tell him the truth.

215
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,980
I don't want him to forgive me and pity me,

216
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,420
but to really fall in love with me again.

217
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,740
By the way, Aunt Zhang,

218
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,980
teach me to make mango soup

219
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
and Glutinous Rice Balls in Fermented Rice Wine
Xia Ke likes best.

220
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,220
OK. OK.

221
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,660
Grandma, I'll go to the kitchen.

222
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,450
Madam.

223
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
What have you found?

224
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,340
There is record of continuous treatment

225
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,980
when she was in the US.

226
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,780
(Meeting room)

227
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,900
In ball module,

228
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,780
a two-person cooperation mode is added.

229
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,810
Different scenarios and styles will come with

230
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,050
different difficulties and cooperation modes.

231
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
Yiyi, go right. Go right.

232
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,930
I did.

233
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,570
Come here.

234
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,130
No. I'll go right.

235
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,220
We're killed.

236
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,300
Xing Yun, there is bug in this game.

237
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,420
Too much rotation for the ball.

238
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,610
If couples fail to pass it

239
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,570
and quarrel for mismatch,

240
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,610
the module will be breaking-up ball.

241
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,810
The final pass was designed by Mr. Xia personally.

242
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,420
I also find it difficult.

243
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,340
The most important part

244
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,610
of the ultimate ball module is

245
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,050
to enhance the understanding of couples

246
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,740
and...

247
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,490
And what?

248
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,980
And to make

249
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,570
couples more intimate.

250
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,980
Instead of controlling

251
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,980
right and left separately,

252
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,660
they'll control both sides together.

253
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,690
Look. The points.

254
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,980
Wow. It increases quickly.

255
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,610
Yes.

256
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,100
Clear.

257
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,860
That will be much easier.

258
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,370
Yes.

259
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,540
They'll clear it soon.

260
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,930
So great.

261
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,780
You, you're impressive.

262
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,810
Well done.

263
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,250
You, you're great.

264
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,180
Well done.

265
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,690
Group Leader Zhang is here.

266
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,610
I heard that you're doing
closed Beta test of the module.

267
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,540
I come to have a look.

268
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,420
Do you want to try, Group Leader Zhang?

269
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,340
Mr. Xia is demonstrating

270
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,780
the secret of clearing the last pass.

271
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,450
Really? OK.

272
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,420
Group Leader Zhang.

273
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,860
I have something to do.
Take your time to play.

274
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,130
Did you say that Zhang Sirui

275
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,420
asked you to buy a gift

276
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,740
for Mr. Xia's grandma that day?

277
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,780
Yes.

278
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,250
Look at this.

279
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,050
What is it?

280
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,570
Calla lily even has this color.

281
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,300
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

282
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,540
Look. Isn't this Mr. Xia?

283
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,570
She visited Mr. Xia's grandma with him.

284
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,130
And read the words.

285
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,050
Met again after a long separation.

286
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,420
I also learned to make mango soup
you like best.

287
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,610
He really loves mango.

288
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,050
Didn't he tell you anything?

289
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,610
Where are you going?

290
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,780
Calm down.

291
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,250
I can't hold it anymore. I'll ask clearly.

292
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,730
Xia Ke.

293
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:05,730
What's wrong?

294
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,730
I want to talk to you.

295
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,660
If I had known the truth of the car accident,

296
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,130
I would have stayed with you.

297
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,370
I would not break up with you back then.

298
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,210
Let the past be past.

299
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,210
At least let me bring Dobby back.

300
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,060
It looks so familiar.

301
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,700
Why is the guest room unoccupied now?

302
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,700
It's always unoccupied.

303
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,370
Then let me stay there.

304
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,300
Anyway, it's unoccupied.

305
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,010
I don't want others to stay there.

306
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,900
Unexpectedly, you have been

307
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,700
taking good care of it for me.

308
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,460
It was in the pet store
for such a long time that

309
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,130
the owner of the store couldn't accept it

310
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,090
and took it home.

311
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,370
I told him my contact information.

312
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,210
Thank you.

313
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,490
Dobby, do you still know me?

314
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,130
Why are you here?

315
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,780
Mr. Xia, go back by taxi.

316
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,540
Leave Group Leader Zhang

317
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,610
and her pet to me.

318
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,490
Xing Yun, you...

319
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,850
Mr. Xia,

320
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Xing Yun asked me
to give the car key to you.

321
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,420
Where is she?

322
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,700
She went home.

323
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,250
Wait.

324
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,610
Hello, Uncle.

325
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,940
Hello, Mr. Xing.

326
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,900
Mr. Xing, I was wrong.

327
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,820
Mr. Xing.

328
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,700
Don't you get WeChat?

329
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,580
Can't you send message through WeChat?

330
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,250
In such a new era, don't contact
by throwing stones.

331
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,660
Will you compensate if you break the glass?

332
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

333
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,370
You're the young man living next door to us.

334
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,540
What? Did you quarrel?

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,730
Just, just a misunderstanding.

336
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,660
What?

337
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,370
Xing Yun misunderstands you?

338
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,970
Has she wronged you?

339
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Has she bullied you?

340
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,850
No, it's not what you think.

341
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,010
Listen, young man.

342
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,210
When falling in love,

343
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,330
man should be responsible.

344
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,130
If she is sad,

345
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,300
you're wrong.

346
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,330
If she misunderstands,

347
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,900
you forget to tell her something.

348
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,700
Got it?

349
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,900
What you said is quite right.

350
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,820
Right.

351
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,610
Is it yours?

352
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,460
So cool!

353
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,970
Please. Please.

354
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,060
Please.

355
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,730
OK.

356
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,300
The sound of the engine is fascinating.

357
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,010
Yes.

358
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,090
You're really good at driving.

359
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,970
Sit well. I'm going to speed up.

360
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,900
I told you to let me be alone.

361
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,580
Xing Yun, he begged me hard

362
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,060
for talking with you.

363
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,250
I think he is sincere.

364
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,940
Have a talk with him, OK?

365
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,010
Let them talk. Have a talk.

366
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:16,970
Have a talk.

367
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,850
Let's go. Go out.

368
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,540
Go.

369
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,580
Go. Go.

370
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,300
You pull me.

371
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,490
Have a talk.

372
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,970
I said I wanted to be alone.

373
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,820
Why are you here?

374
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,460
You don't answer my call or my WeChat.

375
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,060
I can just come here.

376
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,660
The reason why I didn't tell you before

377
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
is that I didn't want you to worry about

378
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,970
something unnecessary.

379
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,490
As you don't tell me,
I'll think more about it.

380
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,460
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,850
I don't want to be unreasonable,

382
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,540
but I'm really distressed.

383
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,370
I don't know how many secrets you have.

384
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,900
Now I don't know if you show me

385
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,780
part of you or all of you

386
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,370
before me when you like me

387
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,210
and date me.

388
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,610
It's my fault.

389
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,610
But believe me.

390
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,850
Whether I have

391
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,010
shown you all of me or not,

392
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,490
I totally love you.

393
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Did you cool down?

394
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,060
A little.

395
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,580
But how did you convince my dad?

396
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,090
He seems to like my car very much.

397
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,850
He is really good at driving.

398
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,940
You went for a drive.

399
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,540
What's up?

400
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,780
Oh gosh.

401
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,970
Have a talk.

402
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,010
Have a talk. Have a talk. Have a talk.

403
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,090
Yes. Have a talk.

404
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,420
Have a talk. Go on.

405
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,540
So she changed her name

406
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,700
and you recognize her
after she came to the company.

407
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,130
So you two dated in college.

408
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,490
So she was the owner

409
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,090
of your guest room.

410
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,250
But she just stayed in the guest room

411
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,420
during the summer and winter holidays.

412
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,090
So you two lived together.

413
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,180
We spent little time together.

414
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,250
Because back then I would

415
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,540
often go to my grandma,

416
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,490
while she often spent her summer holidays
in Shenzhen.

417
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,460
So, she came back occasionally.

418
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,970
But you also know that

419
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,090
she is very picky.

420
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,420
That's why the guest room is what it is.

421
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,900
She is really picky.

422
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,090
But why don't you let me
stay in the guest room?

423
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,820
Don't you know that?

424
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,580
Because I want to stay with you.

425
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,940
So can we just forget things

426
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,780
of ex-girlfriend?

427
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,250
No.

428
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,300
What?

429
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,180
Promise me.

430
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,370
Don't hide the truth from me

431
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,780
as you're afraid that I'll think too much,

432
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,090
be angry and sad.

433
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Neither my feelings nor I am so fragile.

434
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,460
What you fear will not happen.

435
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,490
I promise you.

436
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,820
You went swinging, right?

437
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,210
You mom was almost lying on the window.

438
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,970
She would have checked you
with a telescope.

439
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,610
Nonsense.

440
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,820
Listen, Xing Yun,

441
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,900
with my years of experience,

442
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,370
he has some merits.

443
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,820
You're bought in by a drive.

444
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,580
I made an objective evaluation.

445
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,330
We went for a drive by the way, right?

446
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,060
Yes.

447
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,300
Xing Yun, don't worry.

448
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,420
If he dares to bully you again,

449
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,180
I'll rush next door and sort him out.

450
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,420
He may run away, but his house remains.

451
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,370
Don't. The house next door
will be subleased soon.

452
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,460
Didn't he sell his house

453
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,420
for the company's development?

454
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,730
Yes.

455
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,700
Where does he live?

456
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,580
I misunderstood that.

457
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,330
He didn't sell his house.

458
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,780
Look. Look.

459
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,370
What a young talent he is! A talent!

460
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,060
A talent!

461
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,730
Dad, Mom,

462
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,610
it's late. Go to rest now.

463
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,370
OK. Rest.

464
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,180
That's all. Good night.

465
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,970
OK.

466
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,700
He is good young man, right?

467
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,300
A talent.

468
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,850
A talent.

469
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:39,580
A talent.

470
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,460
Absolutely.

471
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,850
Yao Qing.

472
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,850
Xing Yun.

473
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,820
Why are you here?

474
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,010
I was just sending you a message.

475
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,900
Are you free tomorrow?

476
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,180
Let's have a barbecue at He Yu's home tomorrow.

477
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,330
I've invited Shen Qing and others.

478
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,940
Tell Xia Ke, OK?

479
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,580
OK. I'll tell him.

480
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,780
Are you two loving

481
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,180
each other dearly now?

482
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,730
You said leader of the appraisal group
was Xia Ke's ex-girlfriend.

483
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,730
Zhang Rui?

484
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,010
Yes, She changed her name.

485
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,660
Xia Ke didn't know that until he saw her.

486
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,130
Well, I've never expected it!

487
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,610
What's wrong?

488
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,010
Nothing. I just didn't expect it
to be so coincidental.

489
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,420
Because when Xia Ke had a car accident back then,

490
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,090
she suddenly asked to break up

491
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,330
and left.

492
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,820
Perhaps as Xia Ke received

493
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,210
poor public opinion,

494
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,730
she felt embarrassed back then.

495
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,730
That's why they broke up.

496
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,700
So you can rest assured.

497
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,460
They won't be reluctant to

498
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,900
leave each other.

499
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,700
I think Xia Ke will handle it with resolution.

500
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,970
Ms. Fang isn't good at expressing herself.

501
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,820
She often says that

502
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,090
you take after her in this regard.

503
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,490
She doesn't hope you'd miss happiness
because of misunderstanding.

504
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,010
Does she worry that I will miss happiness

505
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,700
or the chance of marriage connection
for the Xia Family?

506
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,250
You misunderstood her.

507
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,090
If she asked you to come here,

508
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,370
tell her for me that

509
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,850
she can't interfere in with my feelings.

510
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,130
This time I come here

511
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,940
out of my own initiative.

512
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,700
There's one thing she doesn't want me
to tell you,

513
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,610
but I think you'd better know it.

514
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
Her health is degrading.

515
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,250
The group's business is very complicated.

516
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,940
She is old.

517
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,940
If possible,

518
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,370
try your best to visit her as much as possible.

519
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,420
It has long been routine for her

520
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,460
to fight alone in business world.

521
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,730
However, it's unbearable for her

522
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,090
to be alone at home.

523
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,660
She just doesn't know

524
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,660
how to express her feelings.

525
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Please keep in mind

526
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,210
despite all interests,

527
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,660
she's still your grandma.

528
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,300
Yao Qing invited us to meet

529
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,540
at He Yu's home tomorrow.

530
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,580
I accepted it for you.

531
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,850
Welcome.

532
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,940
You're so happy.

533
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Is, is it obviously?

534
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,420
All is expressed on your face.

535
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,420
Are you with a poker face

536
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,010
envious of us with many facial expression

537
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,130
and rich affection?

538
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,130
Really? Congratulations.

539
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,180
Why didn't you tell me

540
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,090
in the supermarket yesterday?

541
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,780
It's a long story.

542
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,370
I want to tell you when we are all together.

543
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,060
If you don't find me,

544
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,210
will you die in the mountain?

545
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,210
Don't carry a bag like that.

546
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,330
It'll be hard to keep balance
with the bag in front.

547
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,660
No wonder you tumbled down.

548
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,010
My, my bag.

549
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,250
I prepared these for you.

550
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,330
Sunscreen cream.

551
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,180
Bug spray.

552
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,610
Perfume.

553
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,780
And...

554
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Why do you bring perfume?

555
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,660
I'm afraid you think it smells here.

556
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,900
I think you might like the scent.

557
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,460
And food.

558
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,490
Popcorn.

559
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,460
Microwave rice with two kinds of roast meat.

560
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,210
Microwave popcorn.

561
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,490
Did you bring a microwave oven?

562
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,700
I want to be your exclusive supply force

563
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,210
with heart and soul.

564
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,940
Yao Qing,

565
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,330
it's true that as we spend

566
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,300
so much time

567
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,370
together that I haven't realized

568
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,250
you are very important to me.

569
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,780
You can regard me as an unplanned happy match.

570
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,180
Give me a chance, OK?

571
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,420
I don't care. Anyway, you saved me,

572
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,820
so you have to be responsible to me.

573
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,540
You can't ignore me after saving me.

574
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,010
You can't ignore me.

575
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,700
You can't ignore me. My head

576
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,780
hurts. It hurts.

577
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,210
It hurts everywhere.

578
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:44,820
Everywhere. Hand.

579
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,010
Someone told me that

580
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,090
all accidents are latent

581
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,250
and ready to happen.

582
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,580
I think that's what happened

583
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,300
to He Yu and me.

584
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,730
Because we are so familiar
with each other that

585
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,250
it would have been impossible
to find that we love each other

586
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,250
without a series of accidents.

587
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,850
Wait. A series of accidents?

588
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,780
What else?

589
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,780
Anyway, some.

590
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,820
Run quickly.

591
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,330
I got it later.

592
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,900
I really liked Xia Ke,

593
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,060
but then maybe

594
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,780
I just got used to the feeling of liking him.

595
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,130
I was not sure.

596
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,940
Though we couldn't be together,

597
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,900
I didn't know how to face him

598
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,700
in another way.

599
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,900
Perhaps it was simple

600
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,090
for me to keep liking him.

601
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,010
I know how you feel.

602
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,370
Since that you've found your true love,

603
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,580
just get rid of the past.

604
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,010
Is anybody calling me?

605
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,130
Is the fire ready? Here you are.

606
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,130
Yes.

607
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,850
After your training,

608
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,210
I got it ready in a minute.

609
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,010
I, I just want to

610
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,970
get a reward.

611
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,420
Bye bye.

612
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,610
Here comes the barbecue.

613
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,290
Come on.

614
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,460
Here come mutton kebabs. Kebabs.

615
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm not good at cooking.
I'm starving to death.

616
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,460
Please pardon. Please pardon.

617
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,850
Sister Xing Yun, can you feed me?

618
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,260
Yes. Let me cool it.

619
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:18,770
Come on.

620
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,740
I'll eat.

621
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,460
Yummy.

622
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,700
I want to be fed, too.

623
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,570
I want, I want tomatoes.

624
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,050
Tomatoes, right?

625
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,980
Well, open your mouth.

626
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,050
Tomatoes.

627
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,330
Is it tasty?

628
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,370
By the way, Xia Ke,

629
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,260
how is the investment appraisal

630
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,370
of your company?

631
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,370
I heard that the leader of the appraisal group

632
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,810
wanted a tea set of Fortnum & Mason?

633
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Did you give her?

634
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,900
No.

635
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,220
Now that you don't exchange it for favor...

636
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,180
In fact, it's good that the leader
of the appraisal group

637
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,810
is his ex-girlfriend,

638
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,020
which may give an advantage to TIG.

639
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,940
What?

640
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,420
You said the appraisal group...

641
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,810
I see why.

642
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,420
Well, did she bully you?

643
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
Why should she bully me?

644
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:13,850
Yes,

645
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,290
perhaps she has forgotten

646
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,050
Xia Ke now.

647
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,610
Well, drink wine.

648
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,330
Right. Come on. Eat meat.

649
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,420
Cheers.

650
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,850
Your, your phone is ringing.

651
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,250
(TIG property management)

652
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,660
Excuse me.

653
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,660
Hello, Mr. Xia.

654
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,500
Sorry to disturb you.

655
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,500
This is the case.

656
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,460
Something went wrong with the elevator
in the company.

657
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,290
Is Miss Zhang Sirui

658
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,420
an employee of your company?

659
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,260
She was trapped in the elevator

660
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,180
for over an hour

661
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,810
and was just rescued by us.

662
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,850
Does she have

663
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,570
claustrophobia or the like?

664
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,610
She doesn't look good now.

665
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,610
Well,

666
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,700
please send her to hospital for me.

667
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,330
OK.

668
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,660
Miss Zhang, I, I'm so sorry.

669
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,850
Mr. Xia said he is occupied.

670
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,530
He can't come here to help you

671
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,530
so he asks us to send you to hospital.

672
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,500
Is everything alright?
The property management company called you.

673
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,180
Yes.

674
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,380
(TIG property management)

675
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,580
(Switch to turn off)

676
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,460
Why do you turn it off?

677
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,570
I'll roast some baby cabbage for you.

678
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,660
Scarlett.

679
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,610
Sit. Drink with me.

680
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,460
Am I so bad?

681
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,290
Xia Ke is so resolute.

682
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,460
Did you go to the hospital today?

683
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,330
I saw medicine on the table.

684
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,330
I went to him, but the elevator broke down.

685
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,610
I was trapped for an hour.

686
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,610
Are you all right?

687
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,020
Ironically,

688
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,660
when I was trapped inside,

689
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,020
I expected for something besides being afraid.

690
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,980
I expected that when seeing me in that case,

691
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,330
he would love me, be soft-hearted

692
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,900
and be obedient to me like before.

693
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,570
How I wish

694
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,020
I had been

695
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,090
forced to break up with him

696
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,740
as I told his grandma.

697
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,530
Sorry. If I could find out the truth back then...

698
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,810
Xia Ke

699
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,090
will only show us

700
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,850
the truth he wants us to see.

701
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,050
(TIG property management)

702
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,750
(Switch to turn off)

703
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,420
Why do you turn it off?

704
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,700
I'll roast some baby cabbage for you.

705
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,740
He is used to hiding things.

706
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,020
Be quick.

707
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,500
Get up now, or you'll be late.

708
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,330
Coming.

709
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,940
I'll show you the formal result

710
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,330
before submitting it.

711
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,330
(Comment on investment: No suggestion on investing)

712
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,130
What does it mean?

713
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,900
The game market as a whole is shrinking

714
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,660
and the number of games is decreasing.

715
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,570
Games supporting TIG

716
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,330
are 2D and female orientation.

717
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,500
There is only a small proportion of female players

718
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,460
in the overall players.

719
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,090
TIG has no mature game planning

720
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,700
facing players of all genders

721
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,740
in the short term.

722
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,850
So present games are not enough

723
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,370
to support long-term development of the company.

724
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,850
So what do you want to say?

725
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,810
I'm doing this for helping you.

726
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,090
The market is fast changing.

727
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,850
TIG is incomparable to Tomorrow Group

728
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,020
from scale to vitality.

729
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,260
Group Leader Zhang,

730
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,090
I'm deeply doubtful of your business ability now.

731
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,220
Xia Ke, come back to me.

732
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,020
If you are with me,

733
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,420
I can revise the appraisal report for you.

734
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,020
Does Mr. Qin know that you act recklessly?

735
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,530
I hope you will give my suggestion
into serious consideration.

736
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,220
Did you hear about that?

737
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,570
Haze overheard the appraisal report

738
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,460
by the printer just now.

739
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,420
He said much of its contents
is unfavorable to us.

740
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,220
What?

741
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,020
As Mr. Xia and Mr. Qin

742
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,530
had a good chat back then,

743
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,260
I thought the appraisal is a mere formality.

744
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,460
After all, they're money-oriented businessmen.

745
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,050
If we can benefit them,
they focus on their compatibility.

746
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,260
If not,

747
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,500
they'll just ignore us.

748
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,740
What to do?

749
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,770
Group Leader Zhang may take
old affection into account.

750
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,130
What do you want?

751
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,020
If you're angry that a few days ago

752
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,050
I sent you and your cat home,

753
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,530
I give you my apologies.

754
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,370
But please

755
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,050
don't affect work

756
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,940
with personal feelings.

757
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,330
This investment is really important for TIG.

758
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,290
Are you teaching me how to work?

759
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,180
Of course not.

760
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,770
I mean...

761
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,570
You just care about investment in TIG,

762
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,290
but know nothing about the undercurrent
of Tomorrow Group.

763
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,740
Tomorrow Group?

764
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,570
Its predecessor was Xia's Group.

765
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,050
Don't you even know about Xia's business?

766
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,130
Health of Xia Ke's grandma is degrading.

767
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,180
She is attacked from all sides
of the board of directors.

768
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,050
Xia Ke runs a game company just for fun.

769
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,180
In such case,

770
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,980
it's his bounden duty to go back now.

771
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,900
I think now he's worried about

772
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,850
how to deal with TIG and you.

773
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,810
Besides, his grandma likes me very much.

774
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,940
After all, I have the ability to give

775
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,500
him a better foothold in Xia's Group.

776
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,290
Quit on your own initiative,

777
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,900
or he will be embarrassed.

778
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,420
This woman is really...

779
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,130
Let's hold different opinions

780
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,570
in TIG's prospects,

781
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,330
but when you're enjoying freedom,

782
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,810
have you ever thought

783
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,370
what price Ms. Fang is paying?

784
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,290
Get to know

785
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,420
her current situation.

786
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,220
Director Su, Chairman Xia comes.

787
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420
I don't know how Chairman Xia

788
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,130
knows this party.

789
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,770
Please.

790
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,770
Chairman Xia, I didn't expect
that you're free to come here.

791
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,850
Welcome you.

792
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,220
I don't know it until today.

793
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,850
It turns out that you regularly

794
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,090
hold such a wine party for many shareholders

795
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,700
to make friendly contacts.

796
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,570
Well, I just want to ease your burden.

797
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,370
Well, all the donation

798
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,940
in this charity wine party

799
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,740
will be donated to empty nesters.

800
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,940
When it comes to empty nesters,

801
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,810
my words may be harsh.

802
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,700
Chairman Xia,

803
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,260
you should make a plan

804
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,660
for your future early.

805
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,130
Director Su, what do you mean?

806
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,220
Mr. An.

807
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,940
Has your cancer been controlled?

808
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,700
What a coincidence.

809
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,220
Your doctor

810
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,090
is an old classmate of my friend.

811
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,940
No wonder

812
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,810
you disagree with such a big acquisition

813
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,290
case of M Company.

814
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,940
It turns out that you're ill,

815
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,530
and your brain has been affected.

816
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,810
Director Su,

817
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,500
both of us are clear about

818
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,220
whether it's good to acquire M Company.

819
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,050
I certainly know
that I shouldn't be too demanding,

820
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,420
but you shouldn't make it worse.

821
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,610
Even so,

822
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,610
given your body,

823
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,740
you can't stop me for long.

824
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,530
We all know that your granddaughter

825
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,180
is good at cooking, while your grandson
is good at playing games.

826
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,900
Neither of them is interested in our group.

827
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,850
You're old.

828
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,220
Just leave it to me.

829
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,090
Who said I'm not interested in it?

830
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,770
Uncle Su, long time no see.
