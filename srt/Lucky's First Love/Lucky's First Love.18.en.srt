=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,660
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,140
I declare that,

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,900
the love alliance united front

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,300
collapses formally.

6
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,220
I declare that,

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,700
the lovelorn alliance united front
is established formally.

8
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,080
You unfeeling traitor.

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,860
I won't ally with

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,280
someone who made me crossed in love.

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,980
Come on.

12
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Tell me the truth.

13
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,640
You actually feel relieved, right?

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,580
How do you know it?

15
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,660
So do I.

16
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,580
I don't know why.

17
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,580
I've insisted for long.

18
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,100
But when seeing everything is settled,

19
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm actually relieved.

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm not so sad.

21
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,940
Right?

22
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,860
Incredibly,

23
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,020
I also feel so.

24
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,420
Then what should we do next?

25
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,180
Next,

26
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,380
drink.

27
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,900
No matter it's unwillingness or relief,

28
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,260
blessing or celebration,

29
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,420
is there anything more important than drinking?

30
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,700
You are right.

31
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,300
Drink.

32
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,380
Let's get hammered today.

33
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,780
Let's get hammered.

34
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,260
What did I say in such a case before?

35
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,380
Good morning.

36
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,860
I have to go first.

37
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,060
Just close the door.

38
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,740
Bye.

39
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,180
Let me make you breakfast, okay?

40
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,380
I have a meeting this morning,

41
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,460
so I ordered the breakfast.

42
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,460
You won't mind it, right?

43
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,060
How come here is a cup?

44
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,900
Wangcai.

45
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,860
It seems that Mr. Xia treats you well.

46
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,500
Okay. Come back with mom to keep working hard.

47
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,420
You don't eat some?

48
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,620
It, it, it's enough for me to drink water.

49
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,940
I ordered

50
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,820
egg, salad and sandwich for you.

51
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,460
What are you nervous about exactly?

52
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,820
Will I rely on you?

53
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,220
I don't mean that.

54
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,380
Then what do you mean?

55
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,780
Enough.

56
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,060
This thing won't happen again.

57
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,780
It was an accident.

58
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,220
It's not an accident.

59
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,980
Many men will take drinking much as an excuse

60
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,740
and pretend it as an accident.

61
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,820
But I won't.

62
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
Can we

63
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,340
have a talk?

64
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,620
For what?

65
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Date?

66
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm full.

67
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,020
Well,

68
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,340
do you know what kind of drinking buddies
are most annoying?

69
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,420
It's those who always nag you

70
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:55,980
and tell you

71
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,660
what happened

72
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,820
after you get drunk the night before.

73
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,780
You should still have this virtue, right?

74
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,140
He Yu?

75
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,540
Girl, where are you going?

76
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
Just drive around.

77
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:40,940
Go.

78
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,020
Xing Yun, you are back.

79
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,540
Come on.

80
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Why didn't you tell me

81
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,260
every time we talked on phone?

82
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,060
Mr. Xia stopped me from telling you.

83
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,060
I thought the investor will let go of the company

84
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,620
as long as I left.

85
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,220
I heard that that investor

86
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,020
had kept discordant concept with Mr. Xia for long.

87
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,740
Originally, Mr. Duan wanted to

88
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,940
deal Mr. Xia a head-on blow by virtue of your thing.

89
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,740
Unexpectedly, Mr. Xia fired him instead.

90
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,460
But TIG has good performance,

91
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,660
many investors should

92
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,740
be eager to invest in it.

93
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,180
I don't know this.

94
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,340
Manager Yao always handles this with Mr. Xia.

95
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,180
Why are they absent as it's so late today?

96
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,460
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

97
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
People are not of one mind now.

98
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,380
In addition, Mr. Xia has abolished
the clocking system.

99
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,740
Now besides those of the Instant Zones Unit

100
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,740
who are still working hard to catch up with the schedule,

101
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,620
other units are just killing time

102
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,460
as they are underfunded

103
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,580
and can't promote the work.

104
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,820
I see that the rest room is also empty.

105
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,340
Even Amy dares to loaf on the job openly now.

106
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,300
She...

107
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,100
She has resigned.

108
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,420
What?

109
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,540
Amy resigned?

110
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,020
What are you doing?

111
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,820
I want to call her.

112
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,140
No, no, no.

113
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,460
Didn't she talk in the group?

114
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,540
How come she resigned suddenly?

115
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,660
She didn't tell me such a big decision.

116
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,300
She was afraid that you would be so angry,

117
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,660
so she dared not tell you.

118
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,420
Why can't I see Mr. Xia?

119
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,020
I went to his office just now

120
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,140
and saw a cup of coffee there.

121
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,140
But I didn't see him.

122
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,980
He should hold a meeting
in the meeting room downstairs.

123
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,420
He is holding an interview.

124
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,860
I called him yesterday

125
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,980
about the interview notice.

126
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,500
Director Li also resigned.

127
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,620
Mr. Xia is looking for someone
who can replace him.

128
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,140
Director Li also...

129
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,620
So don't blame Amy.

130
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,460
TIG's talents are actually very popular.

131
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,580
At the beginning, some resigned

132
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,140
and were promoted with double salary
in other companies.

133
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,940
Slowly, someone became jealous

134
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,700
and thought they could get better jobs

135
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,460
than those who were promoted in other companies.

136
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,300
So they resigned one by one.

137
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,060
Things become like this now.

138
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,660
In fact,

139
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,140
in fact, I came here

140
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,860
after I finished an interview just now.

141
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
But since you are back,

142
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,940
since our mascot is back,

143
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,220
I won't leave.

144
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,660
Let's go through thick and thin together.

145
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,780
Yiyi.

146
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,260
Hello.

147
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,260
Hello.

148
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,300
He.

149
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,420
You didn't answer my messages
to you in WeChat,

150
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
so I called you.

151
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
The book “Mobile Team”
you borrowed previously

152
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,980
should be returned today.

153
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,220
Yes. My later customer has reserved it
again and again.

154
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,180
He must get the book today.

155
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,620
Okay. I,

156
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,220
I can ask the express to send it there.

157
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,460
No.

158
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,340
Didn't I tell you before?

159
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,700
It's all on the borrowing terms.

160
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,340
Books can't be mailed or expressed.

161
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,380
We have to be religious about comics.

162
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,180
What if the book has turned edges?

163
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,500
Okay, you have to return it today.

164
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,660
I know.

165
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,180
Comrades.

166
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,500
Xing Yun.

167
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,020
Xing Yun is back.

168
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,580
You are back.

169
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,940
So much delicious food.

170
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,780
Long time no see.

171
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,260
Morning, Mr. Xia.

172
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,260
Mr. Xia.

173
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,740
I'd like to talk to you.

174
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,620
Mr. Xia, can you tell me

175
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,940
how bad the company is now?

176
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,980
How come the fund has been short for long?

177
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,180
That's what you want to ask me?

178
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,900
This thing is the most important currently.

179
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,100
You don't need to worry about
the company's investment money.

180
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,820
It's enough for you to lead your instant zone team

181
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,820
to make the instant zones well.

182
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,860
I'm the first member of TIG.

183
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,300
How come the fate of the company
has nothing to do with me?

184
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,540
I'm so worried, but you are in the mood for smile.

185
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,300
Nothing.

186
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,220
I suddenly miss

187
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,780
your appearance in my office.

188
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,060
Xing Yun. Yesterday...

189
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,580
Wait.

190
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,500
It's not the right time for discussing love now.

191
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,500
I need to tell you first.

192
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,780
I came back as an employee this time.

193
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,300
For us,

194
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,860
the top priority is to save TIG.

195
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,580
Let's talk about our thing later.

196
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
When can we talk about it?

197
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,060
Forget it. Never mind.

198
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,660
Then I'd like to leave.

199
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,780
Don't worry.

200
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,340
The mascot is back.

201
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,100
TIG is sure to brave the wind and waves

202
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,140
and go smoothly.

203
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,140
You were most annoyed that

204
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,980
they called you mascot, weren't you?

205
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,940
That's the past.

206
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,140
Now I want

207
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,780
to have lucky elements all over my body

208
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,580
so that I can sprinkle over TIG with luck
by shaking myself.

209
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm leaving.

210
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,820
Two thirds of people left.

211
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
But the electricity fee is not reduced actually.

212
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,540
Yeah.

213
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,300
When we get used to extravagance,
it is hard to be frugal again.

214
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,180
The meeting room is empty for long.

215
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
But none would turn off the air conditioner.

216
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,620
What does Mr. Xia think of it?

217
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,820
He is in no mood for this.

218
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,580
Don't worry so much.

219
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,420
Once the company gets investment,
things will be fine.

220
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I said

221
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,940
we should be religious about comics.

222
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,860
How is it?

223
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,540
Have you got the girl you want
after reading it hard for a long time?

224
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,460
I was dumped.

225
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,820
Be more specific.

226
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,740
How should I explain this?

227
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,820
I wanted to overtake on the corner,

228
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,340
but I rushed out of the rail instead.

229
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,780
No way. Even if you got drunk,

230
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,140
you wouldn't recognize her wrong.

231
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,380
I can't go back to the previous racing track anyway.

232
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,260
What do you mean?

233
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,540
Come on, tell me.

234
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,260
After you sober up from the drunkenness,

235
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,020
what will you do

236
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
as you found your long good friend

237
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,700
lie by you?

238
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,460
Is it a man or a woman?

239
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,340
Forget it. You never experienced this before.

240
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,140
You know what?

241
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,580
You guy want to dump her 
after sleeping with her.

242
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,860
It seems that she wants to dump me.

243
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,340
According to your speed,

244
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,260
you two are still good friends so far

245
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,620
for only two possibilities.

246
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,500
First, you have no feeling for her at all.

247
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,500
Second, you have too deep feeling for her.

248
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,580
We live in the same dorm building.

249
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,500
You...

250
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,820
You.

251
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,780
You are Chinese.

252
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,820
Hello.

253
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,740
Hi.

254
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,740
Here. Come here.

255
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,940
Sit down.

256
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,340
Say something.

257
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,580
The emphasis is on page 37.

258
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,700
Yes.

259
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,340
I don't know either why

260
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,060
we are friends only.

261
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
What's up?

262
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,700
I want to know

263
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,060
the real condition of TIG.

264
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Why hasn't it got the investment?

265
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,260
Did Mr. Xia have some difficulties?

266
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Do you date?

267
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,580
No.

268
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,380
Then why do you care about it?

269
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,540
You like Xia Ke?

270
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,700
All right. I understand.

271
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,540
As long as you don't admit it,

272
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
you can have many choices.

273
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,740
I like him.

274
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,180
Then does he like you?

275
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,300
I don't think he will consider this now.

276
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,980
Me either.

277
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,460
I want to put all the energy on TIG.

278
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,980
It's said in the industry that

279
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,180
TIG's leak this time

280
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,540
is due to management loophole,

281
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,700
CEO's self-willed acts and young innocence

282
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,620
and internal chaos.

283
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,060
But from the performance statement,

284
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,460
the company is excellent.

285
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,500
All investors want to make money.

286
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,420
Bad rumors are just one aspect.

287
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,940
Mr. Sun who withdrew the investment

288
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,300
worked with those investors of his clique

289
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,260
to put TIG in the blacklist.

290
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,060
If you invest in

291
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,100
TIG currently,

292
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,180
you will go against them.

293
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,020
Moreover, Mr. Xia is also very picky.

294
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,700
Someone also wanted to invest in the company.

295
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,580
But he doesn't like it.

296
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Do you want to do something?

297
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
I think

298
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,420
you can really date He Yu

299
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,500
to irritate Xia Ke,

300
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,260
this making him turn his grief
and anger into strength.

301
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,700
How about a fight?

302
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,100
I won't give you a chance

303
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,780
to beat me reasonably.

304
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,220
If we really stay together someday,

305
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,860
I will fight with you.

306
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,100
All right.

307
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,540
I won't be merciful by then.

308
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,860
I know your feeling.

309
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,780
Thank you for telling me TIG's condition that day.

310
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,620
See you.

311
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,740
You came for Yao Qing?

312
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,220
Forget it.

313
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,700
So I'm out?

314
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,020
I heard it.

315
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
Who you like...

316
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
Sorry, He Yu.

317
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,500
Never mind.

318
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,140
Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

319
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,540
I've tried anyway.

320
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,500
How about I send you back home?

321
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,500
No need. I can ride back home.

322
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,100
You are back. Yeah.

323
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,740
Mom, what's going on with

324
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,580
that pile of rubbish at the door of Ms. Wang?

325
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,940
She has moved away

326
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,340
to live with her son in the USA.

327
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,180
Her room is empty now.

328
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,140
I guess we'll have a new neighbor soon.

329
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,660
It'd better be a young and handsome man.

330
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,500
Then we can contact him more.

331
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,580
What are you thinking about, Mom?

332
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,660
My pot.

333
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,260
No.

334
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,300
What are you doing?

335
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,020
It's so expensive. Over 20,000 yuan.

336
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,580
I can't  afford to wear it.

337
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,420
You don't want her to be your lover?

338
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,020
Mr. Xia, you...

339
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,420
I was busy yesterday,

340
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,740
so I slept at the company.

341
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,100
Do you need me to take

342
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,780
some clothes from your house to get changed?

343
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,180
No need.

344
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,380
No.

345
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,300
Will he have toothpaste and tooth brush
if he just stayed in the company once?

346
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,700
He didn't wear

347
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,940
this suit yesterday.

348
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Has he moved to the company

349
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,860
to work for 24 hours a day?

350
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,060
Time is up?

351
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,820
Not yet.

352
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,860
But before we leave,

353
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,380
I'd like to talk to you for something.

354
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,700
I may know what you are going to say.

355
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,220
Never mind. I respect your choice.

356
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,260
Xing Yun is back.

357
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,340
I resumed the post for her.

358
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,260
She is really the mascot.

359
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,540
The company becomes lively once she is back.

360
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,700
When I just entered TIG,

361
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,780
my previous colleagues and classmates

362
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,860
all secretly laughed at me

363
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,500
upon hearing that my boss

364
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
was a young man in twenties.

365
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,500
Two years have passed.

366
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,620
Those who laughed at me before envy me now.

367
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,900
TIG is a miracle in the industry.

368
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,100
I believe this miracle won't stop here.

369
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,820
We will surely find

370
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,420
a reasonable and agreeable investor.

371
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,580
But we need to get over this period of time.

372
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,420
Li is indeed under economic pressure.

373
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,860
He had no choice but to leave.

374
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,500
I bought house early

375
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,180
and my son studies in a university now.

376
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,140
I have bit luck in shares.

377
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,820
So I have some spare money.

378
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,140
If you...

379
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Director Wang.

380
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
I've learned your kindness.

381
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,580
But if you believe me,

382
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,500
just keep your spare money well.

383
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

384
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,540
Where is Yao Qing?

385
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,420
Manager Yao quit from this project.

386
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,420
What did you say?

387
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,100
I'm also confused.

388
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,540
TIG's case is stopped long before.

389
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,540
You followed her to this project not long ago,

390
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
but she left.

391
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,740
I received an email just now.

392
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,540
It says Manager Yao is transferred to X Case.

393
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,620
X?

394
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,380
It's said she applied for it.

395
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,900
She said she is more familiar with those in the case.

396
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,460
Are they so familiar?

397
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,820
Let's begin.

398
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
Currently, after the targeted

399
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,260
optimization of the instance zone websites of Infinite,

400
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,620
we can start a full range of external promotion,

401
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,900
namely to begin to collect domestic and foreign...

402
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,100
What's wrong?

403
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,100
What's wrong? Director Wang.

404
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,500
When can

405
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,380
they become a couple?

406
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,980
Mr. Xia is so passive.

407
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,820
I can understand him.

408
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,620
TIG is in a bad condition now.

409
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,860
With his personality,

410
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,020
he might not want to get her involved.

411
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,140
But sharing weal and woe is also love.

412
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,060
Let me see

413
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,100
when you will stop working.

414
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,260
Hi, Dad.

415
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,980
I'll be back now.

416
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,540
No need to pick me up. I'll be back now.

417
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,020
You are lucky.

418
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,580
Gosh.

419
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,380
You scared me.

420
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,780
Girl, it's so early.

421
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,500
Where are you going?

422
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,140
Go to work.

423
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,860
Go to work?

424
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,100
Is she going to work in the southern hemisphere?

425
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,100
Didn't I tell you

426
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,940
Mr. Xia takes out a sum of money
for the transition expenditure of TIG.

427
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,580
Rumors has it

428
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,860
that he sold his apartment.

429
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,860
Good morning, Mr. Xia.

430
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,660
Did he really sell his apartment
to maintain the company?

431
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,780
Sorry.

432
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,380
The computer is down.

433
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,740
Please wait for a while.

434
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,740
Where is the stink?

435
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,020
Do you smell it?

436
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,460
I seem to smell it.

437
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,460
It must be because Mr. Xia didn't take a bath.

438
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,220
It's summer.

439
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,020
Is it your body odor?

440
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
What did you say in front of the boss?

441
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,140
What smell? Why, why don't I smell it?

442
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,780
How about we open the window?

443
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,380
It's smellier.

444
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,260
Is it the stink outside the window?

445
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
I broke wind.

446
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,540
What are you laughing at?

447
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,580
You don't break wind?

448
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,060
It's normal, okay?

449
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,660
How about I exchange the seat with yours?

450
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,380
You can sit over there.

451
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:35,940
No need.

452
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,060
Sorry. I don't know.

453
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,020
I can just sit here.

454
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,580
It's this.

455
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,380
This one is so smelly.

456
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,500
Who didn't throw away your takeaway garbage?

457
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,380
Take it away now.

458
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,900
Time is money.

459
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,300
Can we start now?

460
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,380
Thank you all for your hard work. Dismiss.

461
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,260
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

462
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,420
He doesn't sweat?

463
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,980
Although he doesn't wear perfume,

464
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,780
he smells very clean.

465
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,980
Nothing~

466
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,060
Okay.

467
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,060
I will sign the contract and give it to you later.

468
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:06,900
Okay.

469
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,460
Goodbye.

470
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,220
Okay, goodbye.

471
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,140
Sir,

472
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,020
excuse me.

473
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,260
Can you tell me

474
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,140
what that man said to you just now?

475
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
You mean Mr. Xia?

476
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,460
Sorry, you are late.

477
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,980
His house is pretty good.

478
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,260
But it has been sold out.

479
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,700
How about you tell me your requirements?

480
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,060
I can find a suitable house for you?

481
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,420
Mr. Xia.

482
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,380
Mr. Xia.

483
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,220
Yes.

484
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,820
Did you watch the latest episode?

485
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,020
It's updated last night.

486
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,180
So wonderful.

487
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:11,860
Mr. Xia.

488
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,500
Did you take private work recently?

489
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,220
No.

490
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,300
So why are you so secretive these days?

491
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,180
What's going on exactly?

492
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,980
Not at all.

493
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,780
Is it about He Yu?

494
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,660
Listen up.

495
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,740
The ad connection of Jiawo has been suspended.

496
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,100
You two don't need to contact with each other.

497
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,420
I didn't contact him.

498
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,900
Even if the project has been suspended,

499
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,740
Manager Yao also follows you

500
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,620
everywhere all day long.

501
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,740
Let it go.

502
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,580
Mr. Xia, can you send me back home

503
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,860
after we get off work today?

504
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,700
Wait a moment.

505
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,180
Get out of the car.

506
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,100
What are you doing?

507
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,580
You'll know it after you go upstairs.

508
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,460
What

509
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,860
is going on?

510
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,140
Just follow me.

511
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,980
I've prepared it.

512
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,820
Why are you watching me like this?

513
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,180
I'm wondering

514
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,860
whether you are anxious to be my wife.

515
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,740
What are you thinking about?

516
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,740
Go, go, go. Quick.

517
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,300
Quick. Go.

518
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,460
Here, here. Look.

519
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,300
Is this your house?

520
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,140
Mr. Xia, I heard that you sold your apartment

521
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,460
for TIG.

522
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
I know

523
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,540
you have been sleeping in the company recently.

524
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,940
Your health will be influenced if you go on.

525
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,980
Are you planning to let me buy here

526
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,100
or are you going to buy here for me?

527
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,540
None.

528
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,220
The owner of this house

529
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,260
is Aunt Wang I know.

530
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,940
She went to visit her son in the USA.

531
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,740
So this house is empty.

532
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,900
She doesn't charge me rent

533
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,500
but I need to clean it regularly.

534
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,100
I also need to pay the property fee.

535
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,540
But it's an old building here.

536
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,820
So it's only one yuan per square meter.

537
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,860
But I'm so busy every day.

538
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,940
I have no time to clean it.

539
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,660
I'll clean it.

540
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,460
I can do it. I love to clean house the most.

541
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,260
You can just live here.

542
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,740
Mr....Mr. Xia.

543
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,780
Such a good thing

544
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,900
shouldn't be missed.

545
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,580
When luck comes to you,

546
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,460
you need to grasp it.

547
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,460
Take it as the feedback of the mascot.

548
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,420
She doesn't charge me money anyway.

549
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,860
You can live here.

550
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,540
Anyway, if TIG closes down,

551
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,420
I will lose my job.

552
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,340
Okay, take a good rest.

553
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,980
Text me if you have questions.

554
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,180
I have to go now.

555
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,420
Water once a week.

556
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,120
(Drink more water)

557
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,520
(Expiration Date)

558
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,860
So

559
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,180
you rent the next-door house?

560
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,260
As a girl,

561
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,980
how can you rent a house for a man?

562
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,060
He is my boss.

563
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,580
You shouldn't do this then.

564
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,540
You pay the rent for the one who pays you salary?

565
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,580
His abjection is only temporary.

566
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,220
We should help friends when they are in need,

567
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,340
let alone my savior

568
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,580
who rescued me from the talent market.

569
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,420
You must be reluctant

570
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,380
to see a young and promising man

571
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,540
sleeping on the sofa of the company, right?

572
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,860
In this case,

573
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,860
I can understand it.

574
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,820
I knew you would understand it.

575
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,580
But Yun, I need to remind you.

576
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,740
A lot of news on TV

577
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,900
report that a kind of men

578
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,780
specially cheated kind girls like you

579
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,580
for money.

580
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,060
Rent is just the first step.

581
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,460
He is not like that.

582
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,660
He seems cold and firm in speech,
but he is kind and soft-hearted.

583
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
He is really very considerate.

584
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
He always tries

585
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,140
to do all the laborious and tiresome work secretly

586
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,220
to pay a smooth road for others

587
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,140
and also make others feel

588
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,980
the road is like this originally.

589
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,460
Okay, I see.

590
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,180
You really understand it?

591
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,180
You don't have much money anyway.

592
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,100
Even if you are cheated...

593
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,660
Mom.

594
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,900
Okay. Okay.

595
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,140
I support you. I support you, okay?

596
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,140
But I have a condition.

597
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
I must learn the latest news

598
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,460
of the neighboring house.

599
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,940
You won't tell my dad, will you?

600
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,620
If I tell him,

601
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,980
he can tear down the neighboring house at once.

602
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,260
How does he eat?

603
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,460
I have placed a lot of fast food in his fridge.

604
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,740
Mom, I earn bread with my brain.

605
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,140
What if you made me silly by beating me?

606
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,580
You are silly now.

607
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,700
He is a young and strong man.

608
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,460
But you let him eat fast food.

609
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,060
How silly?

610
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,580
Where are you going?

611
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,620
Go to cook.

612
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,780
Don't cook now.

613
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,860
You will scare him.

614
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,100
You are right.

615
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,940
Then tomorrow morning.

616
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,740
Tomorrow morning,

617
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
I can go to Zhang's shop to buy more

618
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,260
deep-fried dough sticks, pies

619
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,100
soybean milk, Tofu budding

620
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,300
and steamed buns. Steam buns.

621
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,900
Yes. I need to buy more.

622
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,420
Are you going to treat someone?

623
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,980
Did you see someone treating others
with breakfast at home?

624
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,020
A great deal.

625
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,140
Mom, what are you doing?

626
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,740
Come here. Take the bowl and chopsticks.

627
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,060
Silly girl.

628
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,980
Didn't you say you will take some to the company?

629
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
Hurry up.

630
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,060
Take some to him.

631
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,220
Take them while they are hot.

632
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,060
Silly girl.

633
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,780
Girl, do you have such a capacity for food?

634
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,380
You can't eat them up.

635
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,380
I can take some to share
with my colleagues in my company.

636
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,260
I heard that your company is pretty hard recently.

637
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,700
You can take some breakfast to your colleagues.

638
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,740
Got it?

639
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,380
Now young men don't like to take breakfast.

640
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,980
How can you work if you are hungry?

641
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,660
Right, girl?

642
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,540
Yes.

643
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,100
Hurry up. Hurry up.

644
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:08,620
I know. I know.

645
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,700
I'll be late later.

646
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,300
You won't eat it at home first?

647
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,620
Never mind. I can eat them in the company.

648
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,180
Take care.

649
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,260
Dad, Mom, bye.

650
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,460
Eat. Eat your breakfast.

651
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:22,900
Okay.

652
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,140
Someone knocks at the door.

653
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,180
No, no one.

654
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,980
Or it's the neighbor or express.

655
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,420
The neighboring house is empty.
They have moved away.

656
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,660
I guess it's our door. Express.

657
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,420
No. Eat your breakfast.

658
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,220
There is no body indeed.

659
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:51,860
Did you hear it?

660
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,780
You said I'm old. You didn't hear it.

661
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,860
Xing.

662
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,060
You are old and have an illusion.

663
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,580
Really?

664
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,860
No body.

665
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,780
Yes. We need some music for our breakfast.

666
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,020
It's romantic with music.

667
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,420
Okay. Okay. Enjoy music. Enjoy music.

668
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,660
You said I had an illusion.

669
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,540
Someone really knocks at the door.

670
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,580
Xing. Xing.
