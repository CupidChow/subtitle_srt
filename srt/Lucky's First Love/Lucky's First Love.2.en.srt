=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Would you like some popcorn?

4
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
I'm good. It's too crowded.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The movie is about to begin.

6
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,680
It's OK. Haven't I told you
when we were coming here?

7
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
A movie without popcorn has no soul.

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Why is it cold?

9
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,720
I said I wanted hot popcorn.

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,640
Buy it again.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,480
Let's go.

12
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,960
I'll have to queue again.

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

14
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,000
It's been a long time

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
since I experienced the feeling of
expecting an upcoming good show

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,160
after the lights are off.

17
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,360
You haven't been to the cinema for a long time?

18
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,920
Not really.

19
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,720
Excuse me, excuse me.

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
Mr. Xia, I've got

21
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
another pack of popcorn as you requested.

22
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,400
Do you even know to show up?

23
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,600
Don't you know?

24
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,320
I was waiting for you at the airport for an hour.

25
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,680
Did you break up with Chu Nan?

26
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
What would you like to eat?

27
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
This time I met

28
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,000
a French dessert chef in New York.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,360
The mousse cakes he made

30
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
can both amplify the sweetness of strawberries

31
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,800
and have the fragrant grassy taste from plants.

32
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,760
Do you know why?

33
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,440
Why the heck did you break up?

34
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
He added vervain,

35
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,160
the kind often used for aromatherapy.

36
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Do you still love him?

37
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,400
Xia Ke,

38
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
everyone in the world can ask me

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
why I broke up,

40
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960
but only you are not in a position to do so.

41
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080
No matter why I broke up,

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,160
as long as I find my happiness again,

43
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
you are still being held responsible.

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
Chu Nan's mother disliked me having married once

45
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
and having a child,

46
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,520
I have not wronged you
by putting the blame on you, have I?

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,280
Call me if there's anything I can do for you.

48
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
I've been busy with work recently
and I was really tired,

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,400
so I fell asleep accidentally halfway through.

51
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,160
It's OK, it's OK.

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Had I known you were so tired,

53
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
I wouldn't go against your will
by asking you to keep me company.

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
It's not against my will at all.

55
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's do it this way.

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Let's watch a movie

57
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,200
you like next time.

58
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Dating should make everybody happy.

59
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,240
I like documentaries.

60
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,600
OK, OK. Let's watch a documentary next time.

61
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
But documentaries are usually
not shown in cinemas.

62
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,880
Where are they shown then?

63
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,280
At home.

64
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
Would you like to come over to watch it
at my place this weekend?

65
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,440
OK.

66
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
Have you made up your mind?

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
We are talking about watching a movie,

68
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,600
I didn't think about other things.

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
Yes, it's watching a movie.

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
But that said,

71
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,480
I haven't watched a documentary before.

72
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm really looking forward to it.

73
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
I figure you like

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,920
human geography documentaries.

75
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Geography was the subject I did worst in.

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
Was it? It happened to be my thing.

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,080
Really?

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
You are awesome.

80
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I always flunked the exams at school.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
When it comes to geography,
you can also know a lot

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,960
by travelling frequently.

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,040
Am I pretty?

84
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,440
Beautiful.

85
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,760
Don't turn on the light, don't turn on the light.

86
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Mom, are you all right?

87
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,960
Did you injure yourself?

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,600
I asked you not to turn on the light.

89
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,680
You've messed up all my
carefully orchestrated contraptions.

90
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,720
Get up first.

91
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,760
Didn't you go to watch a movie?

92
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
Why did you come back so early?

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
I just came back after the movie.

94
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,760
It hurts like hell!

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,160
Don't take it off.

96
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Dance again for my dad

97
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
when he comes back later.

98
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
Don't take it off, don't take it off,
don't take it off.

99
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,600
To hell with dancing!

100
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,240
My hipbones are almost broken.

101
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,720
Is it a special day again today?

102
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
My Dear Mother has laid out such pomp and ceremony.

103
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,680
An anniversary.

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
The two of you have way too many anniversaries.

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,760
Falling-in-love anniversary, wedding anniversary

106
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,560
and moving house anniversary...

107
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,600
What is it for today?

108
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,240
Today is the anniversary of

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
our first  holiday in Spain.

110
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,240
Daughter, I tell you what,

111
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,440
life should be informed by a sense of ritual

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
which makes a certain day

113
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,960
different from any other ordinary days

114
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,520
and a certain moment

115
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,840
totally different
from any other ordinary moments.

116
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,640
How's your date going with Chu Nan?

117
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,920
Actually Chu Nan wants to ask me
to watch a documentary at his home.

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
One small step for man on the moon

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,760
is one giant leap for mankind.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
Where are you, honey?

121
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,760
Where are you, honey?

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,040
Here I am, here I am!

123
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
Well, did you say yes?

124
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
I shouldn't have said yes, should I?

125
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
It seems things are

126
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,360
going quite well with the two of you.

127
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,360
So are you ready for it?

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
Ready for what?

129
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
This is so weird.

130
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
You are chickening out.

131
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, you are really thinking too much.

132
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,800
I specially confirmed with him yesterday.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
We'll do nothing other than watch
a human geography documentary at his home.

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Are you a single-celled creature?

135
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,240
Do you even believe that?

136
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
Even if you have no hands-on experience,

137
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,200
haven't you read girls' comics?

138
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,680
Heck!

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Just think it over with your walnut-sized brain.

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Why does it cost so much for so little material?

141
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Cabbage is cheap. Wear cabbages instead.

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
This one is OK.

143
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Forget it, forget it, forget it.

144
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,880
Try this on.

145
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,400
Forget it. How can I wear it?

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,320
This... this is too...

147
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Go, go, go.

148
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,280
Well...

149
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,280
Do what an experienced hand says.

150
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,640
Why does this...

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Try them on. I'm experienced.

152
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,920
Pick it up.

153
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,840
Mr. Xia.

154
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,400
Why are you here?

155
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,680
This is a question I should ask you, isn't it?

156
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,080
What's this?

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,480
It's nothing.

158
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,480
I didn't expect you are a mascot like this.

159
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Mr. Xia, as I've emphasized with you many times,

160
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,480
don't call me mascot anymore.

161
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm a competent employee.

162
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Not only can I draw,

163
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,320
I'll also submit

164
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,920
a satisfactory planning proposal this time.

165
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes, Mr. Xia, you are thinking too much.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,400
This is not routine shopping.

167
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,320
It's a special circumstance today.

168
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,040
She has a date.

169
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Are you going to his home?

170
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,960
Well, I'm just going there to watch a documentary.

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Xia Ke, come over to pay the bill for me.

172
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,040
I tell you what,

173
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
wait here for me!

174
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
Is the pin number the same as before?

175
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,520
Hello, Miss.

176
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,800
You've reached the consumption threshold of 2,000 yuan

177
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
to get a pair of silk stockings for free.

178
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,240
Which pair would you like?

179
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,360
Which one do you think is better?

180
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
Anything is fine.

181
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,240
Touch them with your hand.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
These pairs are different.

183
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,200
What are you doing? Hurry up.

184
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,600
Choose a color for me.

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,680
Turns out you like this style.

186
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,640
Men are the best consultants for such matters.

187
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll have this pair.

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Let me get a new pair for you.

189
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,800
What are you looking at?

190
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
Chu Nan's new girlfriend.

191
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
Why are we running?

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,760
Are you a fool?

193
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,400
Didn't you see

194
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,080
the girl just now is Xia Ke's girlfriend?

195
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Gee whiz, Mr. Xia has always claimed himself to be single.

196
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,680
I thought he liked you.

197
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,160
Xu Yiyi, you have very outlandish imagination.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,960
No, I'm serious.

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,840
Originally I thought he just liked to make fun of you,

200
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,680
but ever since your blind date worked out,

201
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
he has become very out of the ordinary.

202
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,080
You see, just now

203
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,040
when he heard you are going
to Chu Nan's home in the evening,

204
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,200
his face turned green at once.

205
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
He's not that kind of person.

206
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,280
Don't rush to deny it first.

207
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Give it a second thought.

208
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Do you like the domineering CEO or not?

209
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,580
(Salary: 4,813)

210
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,280
(Salary: 7,071)

211
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,580
(Salary: 10,898)

212
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,480
(Salary: 15,615)

213
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Of course I like him.

214
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,160
I've had four pay rises in two years.

215
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
He's my hard-won special express train

216
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
taking me to my ambitions.

217
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,720
I'll hold onto him tightly.

218
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
You walnut head!

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,120
It's not even as big as a thin-shelled walnut,

220
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,360
probably only as big as a pecan.

221
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
You'll get the hang of it when pigs fly.

222
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm content enough to maintain a longstanding and pure

223
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
monetary relationship with Mr. Xia.

224
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,360
What's more, I already have Chu Nan.

225
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,160
Wait and see.

226
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm sure Mr. Xia will

227
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
do whatever he can to stop you tonight.

228
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,600
Didn't you say before we came here

229
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,240
that you are gonna usher
in tonight's victory for me?

230
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
Yes, yes, yes, victory.

231
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,920
We can't let that Mr. Xia who thinks

232
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,360
the grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence have his way!

233
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,720
We must win victory to piss him off!

234
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,240
Let's go to another battlefield bra shop.

235
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:34,880
Let's go.

236
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,360
Well, are you not done with it yet?

237
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
You've also brought your laptop.

238
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
Yes. I'm afraid I'll be asked to do something
on short notice by my company.

239
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,360
I really envy your boss

240
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,560
for having an employee like you

241
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,640
who's on call 24 hours a day.

242
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,440
Here, let me carry it for you.

243
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Thanks.

244
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,800
It's OK.

245
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,520
Is... is someone in?

246
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,000
Xing Yun, you are here.

247
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,080
Be quick to come in. Be quick to come in.

248
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,320
This is my mother.

249
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,040
Here, here, here. Be quick to come in.

250
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
Hello, aunt.

251
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,040
Hello.

252
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,520
Well, I... I... I...

253
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,120
No need to change your shoes.
No need to change your shoes.

254
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,120
Come in. It's OK.

255
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,680
No need.

256
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Xing Yun is here.

257
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,560
Hello, I'm Chu Nan's father.

258
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,560
Hello, uncle.

259
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,440
Hello, hello.

260
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,680
Here you are.

261
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,640
Thanks, aunt.

262
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,560
Rest assured,

263
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,960
I've got a house ready for your marriage.

264
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,200
It's in a good location with convenient transportation.

265
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Mom, this is not what Xing Yun meant.

266
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,520
I know.

267
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,720
I said it just to make the girl feel reassured.

268
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,600
Young people nowadays all like living
with their other half on their own,

269
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,600
right?

270
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,880
What kind of decoration do you like?

271
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
Do girls like European-style decorations?

272
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,120
If you get married,

273
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,280
we'll need to have it redecorated.

274
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,600
Have some fish.

275
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,240
Fish is nutritious. Have some more.

276
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,280
Don't stand on ceremony. Help yourself.

277
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,920
Don't keep thinking about losing weight as a girl.

278
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
You are prone to endocrine dyscrasia
if you are too thin,

279
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,480
and you are even likely to have problems
when preparing for pregnancy.

280
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,240
Exactly.

281
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,920
Mom, aren't you in too much of a rush?

282
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm not saying this to scare you,

283
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,840
but women should give birth as early as possible.

284
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Is it?

285
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,360
Mom, are you giving a class or a lecture?

286
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
How can we go on eating?

287
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Indeed.

288
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,120
Young lady, your aunt was showing
her professional habits.

289
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,560
Don't take offense.

290
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,440
I heard it from Chu Nan

291
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,400
that you are working at a game company?

292
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,920
Yes. We are a new-generation game company

293
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,760
and we've made a very popular game before.

294
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,480
But game is not a good thing to get your hands on.

295
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,560
It's like opium which can make people addicted.

296
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,120
She'll shift her focus back on the family
when she gets married and has children.

297
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,480
She'll be busy looking after kids every day.
How can she have time to play games?

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,680
True enough.

299
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,040
Dad, mom,

300
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,040
making games is different from playing games.

301
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,480
Xing Yun is the company's original animation artist.

302
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,240
She does the drawing.

303
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,800
Not... not playing games?

304
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,560
She does the drawing.

305
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,480
That's good, that's good, that's good.

306
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,400
It's good she does the drawing.

307
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
She does the drawing, that's great.

308
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,400
When you have kids later,
you can teach them how to draw pictures.

309
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,640
Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,120
By the way, do you like a baby boy or a baby girl?

311
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,760
Excuse me, I'm getting a call.

312
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,200
Hello, Mr. Xia.

313
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,520
Is it something urgent?

314
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,160
I... I'm talking about the game's promotion plan

315
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
with a project manager of the advertising company.

316
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,560
I need to see the latest character setting
for the instance zones.

317
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,840
The latest version.

318
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,360
Is it so urgent?

319
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
Send it to me now.

320
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,360
Would you like me to send it by hand?

321
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
OK, I'll be there right away.

322
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,480
No. I want you to send it by email.

323
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
You are right.

324
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
As it happens, my plan is still half-baked,

325
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,760
so I'll listen to
the other party's opinions on the spot

326
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,600
before I modify it.

327
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,120
Send your address to me please.

328
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,040
Hello.

329
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,920
Where are you?

330
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
I'm playing golf with Director Qian.

331
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Well, why are we talking about partnership
over the weekend?

332
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,280
There's not the slightest sign of anything happening yet.

333
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,680
I see.

334
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,200
You want me to put up a show

335
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,040
of late-night project meeting with you, don't you?

336
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,040
Director Qian, don't go.

337
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,960
Shall I get another coach for you?

338
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,000
We must at least get a ball into the hole tonight,

339
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,480
right?

340
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,600
To hell with golf!

341
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,880
What place have you chosen?

342
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,560
The light is so dim. How can I play golf here?

343
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,840
I'll quit it, I'll quit it, I'll quit it.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

344
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,200
Do what I say. Ask her to come to the golf course.

345
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,160
I want to see what kind of girl she is.

346
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,080
Uncle, aunt, I'm really sorry.

347
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Are you going now?

348
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,160
Xing Yun, don't go yet.

349
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,480
Don't go. I don't have anything special to give you.

350
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,000
Put this bracelet on.

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,280
No, aunt, it's too valuable.

352
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,960
Don't stand on ceremony, don't stand on ceremony.

353
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,240
Well...

354
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,220
Don't stand on ceremony. Don't stand on ceremony.

355
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,300
Put it on. Don't stand on ceremony.

356
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,160
Young lady, young lady, young lady, do take it.

357
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,360
This is a little something from us.

358
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,400
Yes, yes.

359
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,240
Take it.

360
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,040
Aren't you in a hurry? Go.

361
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,880
Are you sure you don't need me to give you a ride?

362
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,720
No.

363
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,440
The driver is waiting for me already.

364
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
Go to bed early, and the same to uncle and aunt.

365
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm OK on my own.

366
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,480
Be careful on the way.

367
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,960
Bye.

368
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,760
Bye bye.

369
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,360
Why did you come to see me tonight?

370
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,920
I was just curious,

371
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,400
curious about what kind of woman

372
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,240
can make you forget the past so quickly.

373
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,160
Did you see her?

374
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,200
Yes.

375
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,480
She's very simple, very pure.

376
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
She suits you very well.

377
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,440
Young lady, I'm sorry.

378
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,040
My GPS has no reception. I really can't find it.

379
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
I'm in a rush to hand over the car.

380
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
Why don't you go back with me?

381
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,080
It's OK. Please go back first.

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,600
It should be somewhere near here.

383
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
I'll look for it again myself.

384
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,360
Watch out for your safety then.

385
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,600
OK, bye.

386
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,920
Why does it even have no reception here?

387
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
No reception.

388
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
Young lady, do you need help?

389
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
Could you tell me

390
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,080
how to get to this golf course?

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,640
It's right in the front.

392
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
We happen to be heading in that direction.

393
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,680
Let us give you a ride there.

394
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
No need. I can walk there myself.

395
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
It's so late at night.

396
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
It'll take you a long time walking there.

397
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,480
It'll only take ten minutes by our van.

398
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,560
No, thanks, really.

399
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,240
This is in the middle of nowhere.

400
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,280
Go.

401
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,280
Go, go, go.

402
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,360
What's up?

403
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,560
Why did I drop my chain bracelet?

404
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,320
Don't bother about it. Be quick to get on the van.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,160
No, I can't. My chain bracelet is very expensive.

406
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
It costs over 10,000 yuan. All diamond.

407
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,440
Look for it for me please.

408
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,240
Diamond?

409
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
Where is it? Is it there?

410
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
It seems to be there. Have a look for me.

411
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,920
She's run away! Go get her!

412
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Awesome!

413
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,080
This place is a bit far indeed.

414
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,640
It's been two hours.

415
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,400
She should be here to say the least.

416
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,240
Mr. Xia, do you think we've got stood up?

417
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,440
How dare she stand me up?

418
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,280
Is there anything

419
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,320
a woman in love dare not do?

420
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
What perk is your company offering?

421
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,700
When a female employee is dating,

422
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,600
her boss is helping her guard against a nasty jerk.

423
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,160
Do you also arrange marriages?

424
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,000
Is your company still short of staff?

425
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,760
I want to join as well.

426
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,560
I tell you what, I'm doing it all
for the sake of Shen Qing.

427
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
Forget about it.

428
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,240
Shen Qing? They broke up long ago.

429
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,640
I think you are just having a selfish motive.

430
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,840
I'll ask no more.

431
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
I owe you one, OK?

432
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,840
But

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,360
when you are expecting eagerly
to arrange marriage for her here,

434
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,160
they've probably pledged to marry
without a nod from their parents.

435
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
What's more, let me give you a reminder:

436
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,560
If a man wants to keep a woman to stay for the night,

437
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,600
he has many ways to do it.

438
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,100
(Mascot)

439
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,600
She's coming.

440
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,880
Hello. Is your phone an ornament?

441
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,120
Mr. Xia, I'm sorry.

442
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,660
Something happened to me just now,

443
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,880
so it was not convenient for me to take a call.

444
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
Where are you?

445
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,800
I... I may have something to do,
I can't get there.

446
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Are you still at his home?

447
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,080
No, no.

448
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,080
I tell you what, no matter where you are now,

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
come over here for me right away!

450
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,400
I... I'm at the police station.

451
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,120
Park the car for me.

452
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
Wait for me.

453
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
It's such a remote place,

454
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,680
but you asked your girlfriend to come alone.

455
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,880
Since you've asked to come,

456
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
you should keep her safe.

457
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,760
Otherwise how can her parents

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,360
leave their daughter to you
with their mind at ease?

459
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,240
Where the heck is she?

460
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
Now you feel anxious,

461
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,400
what were you doing earlier on?

462
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,600
This way.

464
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
What the heck was going on?

465
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,680
Mr. Xia, I'm sorry.

466
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,740
I was doing a written record just now,

467
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,120
so I couldn't look at my cellphone.

468
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,000
Are you an idiot?

469
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,520
I wasn't asking about your cellphone;
I was asking about you!

470
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,720
It's good to hear you curse me

471
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,560
so that I can be sure
I'm not dead and I'm still alive.

472
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
All right. It's all right.

473
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,640
She ran into a human trafficker.

474
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,680
He insisted on saying he was her husband
and almost abducted her.

475
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,120
Well, where can you go to cry then?

476
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,680
Young man, if you really care about your girlfriend,

477
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,280
don't let her walk alone in the darkness.

478
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
How dangerous that is!

479
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Yes, you should take time to comfort her.

480
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,440
The young girl was so scared.

481
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,560
No, no, he's not my boyfriend.

482
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,800
He's my boss.

483
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,360
Not your boyfriend?

484
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,640
No.

485
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
My boss is so handsome
that he won't think much of me.

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,440
I think you are a good match.

487
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,400
Don't talk nonsense.

488
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,360
Probably some day in the future

489
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,960
you'll be together for real.

490
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,960
He looked anxious when he came here.

491
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,040
Well, can we go back?

492
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,080
You still have to wait a moment.

493
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,320
We've pulled out the surveillance video.

494
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Go and have a look.

495
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,680
You can go after confirming it.

496
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
OK, OK, OK.

497
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,600
What's wrong with your foot?

498
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know. Maybe I've sprained my ankle.

499
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,920
It's not serious.

500
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,960
Be careful.

501
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,080
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

502
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,720
Have you pulled out the surveillance video?

503
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
Must she see it?

504
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,760
Yes, she's the main party concerned.

505
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
According to our rules,

506
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,400
we must have her personal confirmation.

507
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Look, we also have law enforcement monitoring here.

508
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,960
If the criminal suspect is caught later,

509
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,640
this can be your so-called sworn evidence.

510
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,400
Mr. Xia, are you feeling very cold?

511
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,560
Help! Help!

512
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
Older brother, help me!

513
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Who's that?

514
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,760
A human... human trafficker is going after me.

515
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,400
My wife, I've found you at last.

516
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,360
Let's go home and talk about our problem.

517
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,280
Who's your wife?

518
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
I don't know him. He's a human trafficker.

519
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,240
OK, OK, OK. It's all my fault.

520
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm in the wrong.

521
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,920
I'll make amends to you back home.

522
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,440
Enough, enough, enough.

523
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
Don't make a row here.

524
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,000
This is a factory building area.

525
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,200
It's off limits to unauthorized personnel.

526
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Go home quickly.

527
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,840
Well...

528
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,520
Thanks.

529
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Sorry, bros.

530
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,080
Let's go, honey.

531
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,360
Go home. Don't disturb others' rest.

532
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,080
I have identity documents with me.

533
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
He doesn't know my name.

534
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,680
You can ask him.

535
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,760
He doesn't know my name.

536
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,400
What? Wait a minute!

537
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,360
You said she's your wife,

538
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,280
what's her name?

539
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Stop! Don't run!

540
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
This young girl is quite quick-witted.

541
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
When she met a bad guy on the roadside,

542
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
she could find a way to run away for help,

543
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,120
otherwise she'd really be in big trouble.

544
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,480
Why didn't you take a taxi?

545
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,800
I... I took one.

546
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,400
The driver didn't know the way,

547
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
there was no cellphone reception
and no GPS available,

548
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
and he was in a hurry to go back
to hand over the car,

549
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,880
so I just got off.

550
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,080
What's the driver's name? What's his license plate number?

551
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,660
Which company is he working for?

552
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm gonna make a complaint against him now!

553
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,560
Don't, don't, don't be impulsive.

554
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
The driver didn't do it on purpose,

555
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,240
and he kept saying sorry to me.

556
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,160
He didn't do it on purpose?

557
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
Can he pay with his life if anything happens?

558
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
Stop it. This is a police station.

559
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,320
Go back home to quarrel if you want to.

560
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,880
Young man,

561
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,400
what the girl needs is comfort

562
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
after what happened to her today.

563
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Your way of sharp tongue and tender heart won't work.

564
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,920
Mr. Xia, what's to be done with the project manager

565
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
while you've come to see me?

566
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
Don't bother about him.

567
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,760
Hop on.

568
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you want me to carry you in my arms?

569
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,800
Come on.

570
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Sit tight.

571
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,160
Mr. Xia, you've really had a long and hard day today.

572
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,040
Actually you just have a sharp tongue and a tender heart.

573
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,000
I remember on the New Year's Eve last year,

574
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
all the company staff were asked
to stay for overtime by the operator,

575
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,880
and in the middle of the night, we received

576
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,880
luxury sushi combos ordered by an unknown person.

577
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,200
You ordered them to be sent, didn't you?

578
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,520
I know that sushi restaurant is your favorite.

579
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,100
What's more, Dongdong delayed the progress

580
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,760
after the breakup of a relationship last time.

581
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,160
Although you said

582
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,520
nothing can delay the progress of a project,

583
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,440
you gave Amy

584
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,640
a VVIP card of a bar in no time,

585
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,960
saying it was about to expire

586
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,800
and asking us to spend it.

587
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Amy checked it

588
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,640
and found there are still a few years left
before it expires.

589
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,400
Why are you talking so much?

590
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,160
Just let me go on.

591
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,480
In the movies I watched before,

592
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,200
the protagonists always have many lines before they die.

593
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,720
Now it's dawned on me

594
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,120
that they really don't want to die.

595
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,560
You are still far from death.

596
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,920
If I were abducted by the human trafficker today,

597
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,000
who knows what would be waiting for me?

598
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,040
The moment I was dragged away,

599
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,000
a lot of things occurred to me,

600
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,120
like scenes of a sped-up film running in my mind.

601
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,640
I think I've been quite happy

602
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,800
halfway through my life so far.

603
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,240
I have my parents who love me so much.

604
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,480
At work, I have a boss like you
who has a cold face and a warm heart.

605
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,600
I met Chu Nan the first time I started dating

606
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,320
who's willing to take me home to meet his parents.

607
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,520
Parents?

608
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,360
Yes.

609
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,120
I went to Chu Nan's home today.

610
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
It turns out he wanted to

611
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
introduce me to his parents.

612
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,560
I went on a blind date with Chu Nan

613
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,080
actually in a fit of pique at you at first,

614
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,300
because I wanted to prove

615
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,440
I can do a good job of the instance zones
for the game as well.

616
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,560
I started dating him accidentally.

617
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,920
Sometimes I feel sorry for him.

618
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
But having gone through the incident today,

619
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,800
I prayed to God at that moment

620
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
that if I could be saved,

621
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,800
I'd certainly cherish

622
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,920
everything I own now,

623
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,520
and I'd certainly cherish Chu Nan

624
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,080
and get along with him.

625
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,280
Well, when can you stop being so stupid?

626
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,600
You ran into the dangers tonight

627
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,880
exactly because of your shitty boyfriend!

628
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,680
Were it not for him,

629
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,700
how could you be left in the wilderness

630
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,240
without anybody caring about you?

631
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,840
He was too tired. I didn't let him give me a ride.

632
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,120
You are just deceiving yourself!

633
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
He's not what he's like now

634
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,280
when he loves someone.

635
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,680
Do you know Chu Nan?

636
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,720
No, I don't.

637
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Why... why do you say so?

638
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,560
I don't think you should

639
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,000
vilify someone you don't know for no reason at all.

640
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,040
I'm happy to!

641
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,920
Wait and see.

642
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm sure Mr. Xia will

643
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,640
do whatever he can to stop you tonight.

644
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,200
Hop on.

645
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Just a moment.

646
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,960
Mr. Xia, could it be there is no

647
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,440
project manager at all tonight?

648
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,800
In principle, for such a thing,
you should have asked Director Liu

649
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
or staff of Promotion Department to do it.

650
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,320
And you knew

651
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,840
I was going to visit Chu Nan's home tonight.

652
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,440
Were you joking me around again?

653
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,520
You were really jerking me around?

654
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,040
That man doesn't like you at all.

655
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,120
What about you?

656
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,800
Mr. Xia, I think we must

657
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
lay our cards on the table tonight.

658
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,760
No matter how you feel about me,

659
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,600
to me, you are just my superior and my friend.

660
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,720
Although your face is my cup of tea,

661
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,480
I'll never fall for you.

662
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,920
In other words,

663
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,520
I hate capitalists like you most!

664
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,040
What's more, I've sworn tonight

665
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,120
to cherish Chu Nan as best as I can.

666
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,040
I hope you can stop being so childish,

667
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,920
stop making such kind of
boring mischief again later on.

668
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
By the way,

669
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,440
I also hope you can be
more tolerant and magnanimous,

670
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,620
and not use your power to get even with me

671
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,640
for a private grudge and make things hard for me.

672
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,360
Xing Yun, is it because it's so dark today

673
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,240
that you failed to see
what you look like clearly?

674
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,680
Where have you been?

675
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,300
I saw your car running out of gas,

676
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,080
so I gassed it up for you on the way.

677
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,200
I didn't expect you'd be so quick.

678
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,240
Hello, I am He Yu, project manager of Jiawo.

679
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,040
Jiawo's project manager?

680
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,520
So he is...

681
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
So you are Xing Yun, aren't you?

682
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,920
I was waiting for you
on the golf course all night.

683
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,600
What happened to you guys?

684
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
Are you OK?

685
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,760
What's wrong with her?

686
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
It's supposed to be her first time
to have turned down a man,

687
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,960
she hasn't got over the excitement yet.

688
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,080
Is it your company's standard
for choosing employees

689
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,920
to have people who are dead
as a doornail like you?

690
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,240
Say something about the advertising plan.

691
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,040
Ah?

692
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,520
OK, OK, OK.

693
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,560
Our company has designed

694
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,320
several suspense posters

695
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,040
according to the character settings
of Infinite Unknown Love.

696
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,280
As to videos, have you thought of

697
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,080
having a star as your image ambassador?

698
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,200
Our TIG pays attention to the quality of our games.

699
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,560
I know. You always dislike those empty nothings.

700
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Although your face is my cup of tea,

701
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,040
I'll never fall for you.

702
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,760
In other words,

703
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,200
I hate capitalists like you most!

704
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,880
Xing Yun, what the heck is your brain used for?

705
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,660
It's really not unfair for you
to be sold to a mountain area

706
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,200
by a human trafficker.

707
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,500
(Job hunting)

708
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,800
Thank you, Mr. Xia. Thank you, Mr. He.

709
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm going home first.

710
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,760
Remain seated. Don't move.

711
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,760
You really needn't, Mr. Xia.

712
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,080
You can't keep Mr. He waiting here.

713
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,840
It's OK.

714
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,800
I'll leave the car to you and take a taxi.

715
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,360
Miss Xing, have a good rest.

716
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,560
He...

717
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,360
Let's go.

718
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,000
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

719
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,000
Don't you have the key with you?

720
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,120
My bag was robbed.

721
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
Make a call.

722
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
Ri... right.

723
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Nobody answers. Did something happen?

724
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,560
Can't you call their cellphone?

725
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,200
Hello.

726
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,360
Daughter, you are calling me
at such a late hour.

727
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
Don't you know I'm in the middle
of my beauty sleep?

728
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,680
Mom, open the door for me.

729
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
Didn't you go to Chu Nan's place?

730
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,280
Even so, I've got to go home.
Be quick to open the door.

731
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,360
I'm not at home.

732
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,880
We thought you'd come very late,

733
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,320
so your dad and I have come
to a hotel for a holiday.

734
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,760
What?

735
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,840
Open the door with your own key.

736
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,880
I lost my key.

737
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,640
Gee whiz, my goodness!

738
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,560
Women in love have zero IQ indeed.

739
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,520
You even lost your key as a grown-up.

740
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,600
What shall we do then?

741
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,280
How does this sound?

742
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,720
Go to Chu Nan's place
to put up for the night.

743
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,360
But I have to remind you,

744
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,840
since the two of you haven't known
each other for long,

745
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,720
you must learn to protect yourself.

746
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,840
Mom, what did you say?

747
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,240
Hello?

748
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:11,800
Hello?

749
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,600
What's up?

750
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,200
Mr. Xia, my mom is taking a shower.

751
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,040
Please go back first.

752
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
It's such a coincidence
that my dad is taking a dump.

753
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,800
Goodbye, Mr. Xia.

754
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,080
It's so late. Has he already gone to bed?

755
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,440
Forget it.

756
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,040
Isn't a boyfriend used for
offering timely help in the hour of distress?

757
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,540
(Xing Yun)

758
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Is it her?

759
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm going.

760
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,280
Don't go.

761
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,240
I've been sitting in the car all night,

762
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,160
you have to let me go home
to check in on my son, don't you?

763
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,320
Sit with me for a little while.

764
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
He's gone to bed as I expected.

765
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,600
I made a gaffe today.

766
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,880
Let's not see each other anymore later on.

767
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,680
It's so late,

768
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
Yiyi doesn't pick up the phone
and Amy switched off her phone,

769
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,840
God wants me to die.

770
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,040
Mr. Xia, actually I can stay in a hotel.

771
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
Do you have money?

772
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,400
Could you lend me some?

773
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,880
Do you have an ID card?

774
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,640
How does this sound?
Could you check into a room for me

775
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,960
and I'll transfer the money to you later?

776
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,440
I watched the news a couple of days ago

777
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,240
which says a girl was almost taken away

778
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,640
by a stranger when she was staying in a hotel.

779
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,120
Let's do it this way.

780
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,720
I'll drive you to your boyfriend's place.

781
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,320
No.

782
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,040
He lives with his parents,

783
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,000
and he didn't pick up the phone either.

784
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,640
So please help me, Mr. Xia.

785
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,800
Take care.

786
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,520
I'll go to the study.

787
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,040
As it happens, I've got to sort out
the character settings.

788
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,160
Stop.

789
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,640
You'd better look in the mirror

790
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,720
and sort out your own character setting.

791
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,880
Well, Mr. Xia, could I have some water?

792
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,080
Help yourself.

793
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,440
Gosh!

794
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,560
Why are you nervous?
It's not your first time being here.

795
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,960
This is different.

796
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,040
Before I came here with my colleagues
for meetings and overtime,

797
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,960
or I was shut in the study to modify sketches.

798
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,920
Now...

799
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,120
It's the same now.

800
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,200
Slice (the oranges).

801
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,760
Mr. Xia, oranges.

802
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,120
Dress your wounds yourself.

803
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,920
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

804
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,880
Be gentle, don't move.

805
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,520
Little did I think your painter's hands

806
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,320
could be so clumsy.

807
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,960
Wind down a little.

808
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,800
I can't wind down.

809
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,680
It won't work at all if you don't wind down.

810
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:00,920
Well then,

811
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,760
let me tell you a secret.

812
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,440
My first girlfriend

813
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,920
used to be a kendo coach,

814
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,440
so I'm quite experienced in this.

815
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,720
Did you often dress her wounds for her?

816
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,200
I dressed them for myself.
