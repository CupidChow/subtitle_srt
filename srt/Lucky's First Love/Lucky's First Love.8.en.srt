00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,550
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
Take a rest on the sofa for a while.

4
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,360
Is it an irony?

5
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,910
Are you testing me?

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,960
I feel very uncomfortable
when looking at your face.

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,160
It must be tough for you.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,880
Will you go or not?

9
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,960
Of course I'll go.

10
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,960
It's so comfortable.
You must always loaf on the job.

11
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,520
I wanna eat it, too.

12
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,270
Sweet and sour spare ribs.

13
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,360
Wonton.

14
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
Time to eat.

15
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,000
You really have a sensitive nose.

16
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,030
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.
Sweet and sour spare ribs.

17
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,030
Wonton. They are all of my favorite food.

18
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,910
Mr. Xia, you can't finish
so much food. Right?

19
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,160
Leftovers will block a person

20
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,480
to heaven.

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,350
Don't you see I prepare two bowls of rice?

22
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,790
Don't talk nonsense. Hurry to eat!

23
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,600
Are you still the Mr. Xia I know?

24
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,950
Don't you be attached by some creature?

25
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,670
No!

26
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Mr. Xia, why are you suddenly so good to me?

27
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,640
Do you know something?

28
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,670
What do you want me to know?

29
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,600
It's about last night

30
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,790
what happened to me in that KTV.

31
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,200
Go on.

32
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,390
My cousin came to find me again last night.

33
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,480
The one that sent me
the wrong information before.

34
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,390
She forced me to the KTV

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,350
with the name of celebrating
my disappointment in love.

36
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,110
And?

37
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,790
Then we sang to the middle of the night.

38
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,070
I fell asleep by accident.

39
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,320
But she left without waking me up.

40
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,510
Do you know?

41
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,160
I was almost taken away by a trafficker again.

42
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,000
Trafficker!

43
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,350
Eat quickly!

44
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,640
Go out with me after eating.

45
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,600
To do what?

46
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,000
Visit customers.

47
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh.

48
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,270
Believe it or not, it will disappear.

49
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,550
It will disappear soon.

50
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,000
It will disappear soon.

51
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,000
What's up?

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
I don't know either.

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,350
Mr. He is so brilliant.

54
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,040
Don't call me Mr. He.

55
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,760
Call me Hehe.

56
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,350
Let's go.

57
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,070
You are much better now.

58
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,880
Mr. Xia, remember to knock
at the door next time.

59
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,790
You! You! You!

60
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,070
I!

61
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,320
You!

62
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,600
I!

63
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,670
He! He! He！

64
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,320
He Yu, Jiawo's project manager.

65
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,070
You have met before on the golf course.

66
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,110
Hello, I am the project manager of Jiawo.

67
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,320
He Yu.

68
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,920
Jiawo's Project Manager?

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,600
Remember it? Miss Xing?

70
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,390
Mr. Xia, I still have something to do.
I gotta go.

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,230
Stop!

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,640
Apologize!

73
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Mr. He, I am sorry.

74
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,440
Miss Xing.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,670
I am particularly curious for one thing.
So I wanna ask you.

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,830
Please.

77
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
I kindly invited you to sing a song.

78
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,550
But you hit me with a microphone.

79
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,920
Who did you think I was?

80
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,720
It's a misunderstanding.

81
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,320
A drunkard or a playboy?

82
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,320
Or your ex-boyfriend?

83
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,270
Trafficker.

84
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,600
What did you say?

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,200
Do I look like a trafficker?

86
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,040
Sorry.

87
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,000
It's my fault. I am blind.

88
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,000
I am highly myopic.

89
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,830
Don't worry.

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,550
I'll be responsible for your medical expenses.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,640
Money matters nothing to me.

92
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,350
What matters is my life.

93
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,160
Because it will be rewritten
because of this accident.

94
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,550
The doctor said

95
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
I have a cerebral concussion by your hit.

96
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,070
There is blood stasis inside my brain.

97
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,510
I might have a sequela.

98
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,550
What?!

99
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,350
I'm going to get married next month.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,950
But now my head gets hurt.

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,070
Will my girlfriend marry me?

102
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
Sorry! Sorry!

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,600
I really didn't think it would be so serious.

104
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,640
If you really have any problems in the future,

105
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,830
I will be responsible for you.

106
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,230
No matter how much it costs,

107
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,720
I'll pay for your medical expenses.

108
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,510
How do you cure?

109
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
Can you cure the wounds of my heart?

110
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
Can you marry me?

111
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,550
Enough.

112
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,670
Can't stand it?

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
He just has a slight cerebral concussion.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,590
By the way, he is a celibatarin.

115
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,110
Really?

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,470
Do not worry.

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,910
Girls who want to marry me

118
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,320
even can be found in the southern hemisphere.

119
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
If you want to stand in line,

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,400
you must wait for a long time.

121
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,030
Birds of a feather flock together.

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,200
It is said that this Mr. He

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,790
is the classmate of Xia
when he studied abroad.

124
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,150
His arrogant look

125
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,640
is really like him.

126
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,150
It's good to see you're fine.

127
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,400
Give that back to her quickly.

128
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,790
The music.

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,790
The ringtone is really too outdated.

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,030
It was ringing.

131
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,080
So I shut it down.

132
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,710
Why did my parents call me so many times?

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,840
Mr. Xia, I'm going out to call back.

134
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,400
Interesting.

135
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,550
You!

136
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,470
My mobile phone was left in somewhere.

137
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,320
I just got it back.

138
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm in the hospital.

139
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,000
No, I'm not injured.

140
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,320
Mom, calm down.

141
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,760
I'll go back right away, okay?

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,350
What happened?

143
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,400
My parents don't know what happened.

144
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,790
They're worried because they

145
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,960
didn't contact me for a day.

146
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,320
He Yu gives your phone back

147
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
on the condition that he must see you.

148
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,400
I beat him like this.

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,710
It's reasonable that he is angry.

150
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,520
But Mr. Xia, are you explaining this to me?

151
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,110
Go back quickly.

152
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,400
So he?

153
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,880
I'll handle it.

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

155
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,910
If she goes through something terrible,

156
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,710
I won't live.

157
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,760
My daughter!

158
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,030
Finally you come back.

159
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,320
You scared me.

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,320
-Mom, what's wrong? -You're back.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,590
What happened?

162
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,470
Thank goodness, you are finally back.

163
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,440
If you don't come back,

164
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,670
we'll go to call the police.

165
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,440
You bad girl.

166
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,790
When did you leave?
Why didn't you wake me up?

167
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,790
Wasn't I drunk?

168
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,550
I woke up at night and went home unconsciously.

169
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Do you know how miserable I was
because of you?

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So you didn't answer the phone!

171
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,910
You didn't go back home without any news.

172
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,960
Have you thought about me and your mom?

173
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,960
Do you know how we went through last day?

174
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,280
Your mom has a high blood pressure again.

175
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,790
Don't shout at her.

176
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,230
Our daughter is just disappointed in love.

177
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,350
She is in a bad mood.

178
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,350
If you shout her,

179
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,150
what if she runs away from home?

180
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,590
I just want to wake her up.

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
She doesn't know how to love herself.

182
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,280
You run away from home for a man

183
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,790
who doesn't love you.

184
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,520
Do you consider your mom and dad?

185
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,470
Wait, who runs away from home?

186
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,960
You!

187
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,440
You know that I broke up with Chu Nan?

188
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,400
We can't contact you all the time.

189
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,000
So I came back and told them.

190
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,670
My darling!

191
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,030
So many people suicide for love.

192
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,550
You didn't answer the phone.

193
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,910
What if you're tired of living?

194
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,640
Mom! Dad!

195
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,790
Do you believe what Xing Cheng said?

196
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,470
I did break up with Chu Nan.

197
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,910
But we broke up peacefully.

198
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,710
Silly girl!

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,080
You should give us a call whatever happened.

200
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,150
My phone was

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
left in a KTV.

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,840
I just got it at night.

203
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Why don't you tell us that

204
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,080
you break up with him?

205
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,880
I was afraid that you would worry
and be disappointed.

206
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,200
Especially my mom.

207
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,640
Don't you always hope

208
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,840
I can fall in love and get married early?

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,230
I hope you fall in love

210
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,550
because I hope you can

211
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,790
communicate with other people

212
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,150
more in this way.

213
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,470
Who really hopes

214
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,520
her daughter marries early?

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,910
Mom.

216
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
Tell me the truth.

217
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,640
You really broke up with Chu Nan?

218
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,590
You don't like him?

219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
Actually I'm very grateful to him.

220
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,350
After this time,

221
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,840
next time I won't waste time

222
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,230
to fall in love with a Mr. Wrong.

223
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,080
This's also a good thing.

224
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,230
Oh, my god.

225
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,440
What's up?

226
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,280
Your dad is so worried.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,590
So he asked me to call Chu Nan.

228
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,520
Right!

229
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,960
Your dad just asked him to come here quickly.

230
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,910
He wants to claim justice for you.

231
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,590
I have to do it.

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
Dad, it's not Chu Nan's fault.

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,760
He is coming.

234
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,000
Chu Nan, I am back home.

235
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,910
You are downstairs?

236
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,030
Sorry about that.

237
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,080
It's my fault that you had to come here
and get scolded by my dad.

238
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,200
Nothing.

239
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,110
I should have come here

240
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,670
to make it clear to your parents formally.

241
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,110
Well.

242
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,520
How are you and Shen Qing?

243
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,350
No matter what happens,

244
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,760
I won't give up.

245
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,760
I can use the way she can accept

246
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,670
to wait for her and guard her.

247
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,200
I was supposed to be mad at you.

248
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,880
But now I find

249
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,760
you really love Shen Qing.

250
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,960
I just said to my parents

251
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,200
you let me know what a couple without love

252
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,960
should be.

253
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,280
But now I seem to understand

254
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,590
what it should be when you love someone.

255
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,320
You do not know.

256
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,150
Only when you meet the Mr. Right,

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
you will know it.

258
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,060
(Reply at once)

259
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
Let me pick up a call.

260
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,760
Hello?

261
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,550
Hello, is everything okay at your home?

262
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,710
Nothing.

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,880
That's it.

264
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,640
Wait.

265
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,150
Mr. Xia, are you caring about me?

266
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,670
I only care about whether you will ask for leave.

267
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,200
You're still that Mr. Xia.

268
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,400
Xing Yun, you're really a good girl.

269
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,200
You can't count me as your first love.

270
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,710
The world owes you a perfect first love.

271
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,520
Thank you.

272
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
What are you looking at?

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,670
Why do you crowd together?

274
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,520
So happy you are.

275
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,840
No. Shen Qing.

276
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,840
We receive a very strange order.

277
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,910
Strange?

278
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,280
He wants to order sweet ginger bread.

279
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,550
He requests that black coffee
should be added to the flour.

280
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,030
This's the first time we receive an order
with an instruction.

281
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,710
They really treat us as a private custom shop.

282
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,840
Where is the address? Show me.

283
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,110
Right here.

284
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,210
(To our past love and marriage)

285
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,230
Boss, where are you going?

286
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,440
What delicacy you're cooking?

287
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I am inventing a new bread.

288
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,280
Sweet ginger flavor.

289
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,470
Add your favorite black coffee inside.

290
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,350
Really?

291
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,670
So this is just for me.

292
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,110
OK.

293
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,150
From the scene we can see

294
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,790
this accident is quite serious.

295
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,550
The owner of the car, Mr. Ling,
is seriously injured.

296
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,640
He has been taken to the hospital for rescue.

297
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,440
It's reported that his wife's brother
raced with him.

298
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
The specific cause of the accident

299
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,640
is still under investigation by the police.

300
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,150
This is impossible.

301
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,320
He's gone.

302
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,880
Where did he go?

303
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,790
This child can't stay in the Xia's family.

304
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,880
I will arrange to send him away.

305
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,640
Send him away?

306
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:38,910
Where do you send him away?

307
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,320
Welfare house?

308
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,520
Do you hope Ling Shan's son

309
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,080
becomes an orphan?

310
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,230
He doesn't deserve to be a father.

311
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,400
Nobody can take my son away.

312
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,590
Mr. Ling booked sweet ginger bread

313
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,190
with a card saying

314
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,950
to our past love and marriage.

315
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,520
It's really you.

316
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,520
Long time no see.

317
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,830
How are you?

318
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,310
As you can see.

319
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,920
You're still so excellent.

320
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,430
I know whatever you do,

321
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,470
you will do the best.

322
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,880
Your legs are well-healed?

323
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
Shen Qing,

324
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,880
I know that you were looking for me.

325
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,710
So many years have passed.

326
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,590
Shen Qing, I owe you an apology

327
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,710
and an explanation.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,350
I left you because...

329
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,880
Forget it.

330
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,430
Actually, I come here today

331
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,190
because I wanna know

332
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,800
whether I let those things go or not.

333
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,950
When you are standing in front of me,

334
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,110
I'm glad that you are fine and can still walk.

335
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,400
Those misunderstandings,
resentments and disappointments

336
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,160
have been erased by time.

337
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,190
Right.

338
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,000
As for the bread you ordered,

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,520
our studio can't make it for the time being.

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because I forgot

341
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,040
how to make it.

342
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,310
Sorry.

343
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,800
May I see our son?

344
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,560
Mr. Xia.

345
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,710
I think you'd better arrange another staff

346
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,880
to communicate with Mr. He.

347
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
He doesn't talk to me at all.

348
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,070
Mr. Xia.

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,520
Is it so hard for you to knock at my door?

350
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,950
Where are your manners?

351
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,950
Does our project manager

352
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,230
make you so dissatisfied?

353
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,800
His name is very boring.

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
I'm not joking.

355
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,800
Me neither.

356
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,640
We know each other well.

357
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,400
Do we need others?

358
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,040
Me? You're not qualified enough.

359
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Well. You are a president now.

360
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,400
So you belittle a customer manager like me.

361
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,000
But you should understand what I mean.

362
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,000
There's no need

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,310
to arrange so many intermediaries between us.

364
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,430
Instead of getting staff
from the Planning Department

365
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,350
to send a message

366
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,310
you might as well let the instance project leader

367
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,040
to communicate with me.

368
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,470
So both parties can get into a groove more quickly.

369
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,560
You mean Xing Yun?

370
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,710
I forgot that she is the person in charge.

371
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,830
She is much more fun.

372
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Hello.

373
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,710
Is there a girl named Xing Yun?

374
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes, wait a moment.

375
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,680
Okay.

376
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,350
Xing Yun, a gentleman at the front desk
wants to see you.

377
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,280
Sorry, may I have your name?

378
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,190
My surname is Lin.

379
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,400
He said that his surname is Lin.

380
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,230
Ok.

381
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,920
She will come out soon.

382
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,920
Thank you.

383
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,160
Hello, Mr. Lin.

384
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,190
I am Xing Yun.

385
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,190
Hello.

386
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,190
You can call me Uncle Lin.

387
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,590
Okay, Uncle Lin.

388
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Let's find a cafe nearby

389
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,640
to have a chat.

390
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.

391
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
Give me a cup of Cafe Americano.

392
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,800
Ok, wait a moment, please.

393
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,590
Thank you.

394
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,280
Sorry to bother you with coming here

395
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,920
I'm really sorry.

396
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,350
It doesn't matter. You are busy at work.

397
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
No. No.

398
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,880
Then let's get to the point.

399
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,070
Well.

400
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,950
That.

401
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,920
I like small animals very much.

402
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,000
I always help some feral cats and dogs.

403
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,830
Their lives are really fragile.

404
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,040
They really need our help.

405
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,950
This shows that you are very caring.

406
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,230
Well.

407
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,350
Are you in good health?

408
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,430
You look like a little skinny.

409
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Although I look weak,

410
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,160
I am in very good health.
I rarely fall ill.

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,110
So good. Is your work busy?

412
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,400
A bit busy,

413
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,710
But I will try my best to take time out.

414
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,640
Good, apart from cats and dogs,

415
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
what other hobbies do you have?

416
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,160
I like reading comics.

417
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I usually stay at home when I am at rest.

418
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,040
I like the kind of girl like you.
Very stable.

419
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,230
You are different from other girls
who are fond of muddling along.

420
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,710
By the way, can you do housework?

421
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,560
A little.

422
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,280
Miss Xing, I am very satisfied with you.

423
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,710
When you are available,

424
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,920
you can come to our place to have a look.

425
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,430
How about tonight?

426
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
Or you can pick other time.

427
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
She doesn't have time any day.

428
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Mr. Xia.

429
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,400
It's not time to work.

430
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,680
Don't you have other choices?

431
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,710
What do you mean?

432
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,280
This is?

433
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,280
This is my boss.

434
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,640
Mr. Xia. I have something to do.

435
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
You can go back.

436
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,800
Go back with me.

437
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,310
No. No. No.

438
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,680
Don't do that. I have something serious to do.

439
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,920
He can be your father at this age.

440
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,400
No! What are you thinking?

441
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,190
I. This.

442
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,920
I tell you.

443
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,640
I really want to be her father.

444
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,800
You're right.

445
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,070
I come here to have a blind date for my son.

446
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,880
This is my son.

447
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,280
Very sorry.

448
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,830
I come directly to you without a middleman.

449
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,190
My son is very brilliant.

450
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,710
You two are especially matched.

451
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,830
Wait a minute.

452
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,470
You are not that

453
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,640
Mr. Lin in charge of the stray cat house?

454
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,230
What stray cat?

455
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,040
I just sent my resume to you.

456
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,470
The stray cat home.

457
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,710
Don't you come to interview me?

458
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,350
Miss Xing, you, you said this.

459
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,070
I really don't know what's going on.

460
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Wait.

461
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,760
How do you get her contact?

462
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,360
(Xing Yun, 24, an employee in TIG.
Phone number: 13839574916)

463
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,800
Xing Cheng is really getting too much.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,190
Xing Cheng, your cousin?

465
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,230
Since I broke up with Chu Nan,

466
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,310
she has kept saying that she owes me a boyfriend.

467
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,760
She introduces me to many blind dates.

468
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,800
Now she even posts my personal information online.

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,680
Let's go.

470
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,830
Young man,

471
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,920
can you give me a copy of your information?

472
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,640
I know you are a talent when I first see you.

473
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,950
How old are you? My daughter can be
your girlfriend, is that okay?

474
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,640
Young man, what do you do?

475
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,280
Young man, this is my daughter's WeChat.

476
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,950
Just add her.

477
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
You two can have a chat.

478
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,760
Your daughter is 30 years old.

479
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,070
How young this young man is!

480
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Young man, my daughter is only 28 years old.

481
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,640
She is a famous university graduate.

482
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,280
My daughter is better.

483
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,640
My daughter is 25 years old. She just graduated.

484
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,000
Also graduated from a famous university.

485
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,310
Mr. Xia, I am sorry today.

486
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,760
Apologize? Forget it.

487
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,160
I am going to a Game Company in Shanghai next week

488
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,710
for communication.

489
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,950
What should you do? I don't need to tell you.

490
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,160
Why me again?

491
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Because you're particularly talented

492
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,680
to do this kind of thing.

493
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,310
You are exploiting workforce.

494
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,590
Get it.

495
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,830
By the way,

496
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,190
if your cousin arranges

497
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,800
some activity for you,

498
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,070
just refuse her.

499
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,000
Jiawo's project is handed down to you.

500
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,680
You let me communicate with Mr. He?

501
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,640
But I hit him before.

502
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,230
Just make up for it.

503
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,470
Or do you think the busy work

504
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,640
will affect your blind date?

505
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,590
No. No.

506
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm going to prepare for it.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,470
What's up again? Mr. Xia?

508
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,710
Replacing the person to communicate

509
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,800
is done as you request.

510
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,430
Mom.

511
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,520
Mom.

512
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,880
Mom, who is this uncle?

513
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,350
Xiaoxi, he is...

514
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,710
I am your dad. Come over.

515
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,590
Come on!

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,110
I have no dad.

517
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,400
Don't scare him. Let me talk to him slowly.

518
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,470
I'm just too excited.

519
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,430
Mom, is he really my dad?

520
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,760
He is your dad.

521
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,400
Eat more.

522
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,760
Let me buy you a cream cake, okay?

523
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,400
No.

524
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,190
No need to be so polite to me.

525
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,520
No matter the cake who makes it,

526
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,070
it's not as delicious as the cake my mom make.

527
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,880
Right. Your mom makes the best cake.

528
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,280
How about buying you an ice cream?

529
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,520
He can't eat that much. Don't waste food.

530
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,470
You don't understand my mood now.

531
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
I never imagined that I

532
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,310
can be a dad one day.

533
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,920
You know

534
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,920
I haven't seen my parents or relatives
since I was a child.

535
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,640
I am an orphan.

536
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,350
But today I have Xiaoxi.

537
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,350
He is my only son in my life.

538
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,760
What do you mean?

539
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,350
Nothing.

540
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,280
I'm just too happy.

541
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,470
Shen Qing.

542
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,880
Hi! Chu Nan, I am Shen Xiaoxi.

543
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,640
Xiaoxi, where's your mom?

544
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,950
Chu Nan, come to find my mom.

545
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,400
Otherwise my mom will like another guy.

546
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,560
Xiaoxi, don't talk nonsense.

547
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,800
Your mother has the freedom to make friends.

548
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,110
But that enemy is too strong.

549
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,400
More terrible than the most terrible monster.

550
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,920
He is my dad, my biological dad.

551
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,560
What did you say?

552
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,710
I said my dad is back.

553
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,760
Biological dad.

554
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,280
He Yu requests to directly communicate
with the project team.

555
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,000
Because many intermediate links

556
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,950
lead to information distortion.

557
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,400
So Xing Yun

558
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,880
must have an accurate understanding of our style

559
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,950
and pass on our needs to him

560
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,760
without error.

561
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,190
Everything he needs

562
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,040
should be provided by you.

563
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,680
To be precise, on call at any hour.

564
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Assist her.

565
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,520
I will.

566
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,760
Mr. Xia, time to go to the airport.

567
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,710
Right, cancel all of your

568
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,470
trivial matters.

569
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,950
Mr. Xia, I'll definitely remember your teachings.

570
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,160
You can go away at ease.

571
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,560
You really hope I go away?

572
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,470
How could it be?

573
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,400
Cheers!

574
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,880
I certainly hope that he goes away soon.

575
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm going to treat you tonight. Suit yourself.

576
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't you know that we shouldn't
eat anything after noon?

577
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,430
You order so much food.

578
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,400
What do you know?

579
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,000
Mr. Xia is away on a business trip.

580
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,560
Without his exploitation,

581
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,070
she can't be happier.

582
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,520
Xing Yun, answer me.

583
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,830
Did Mr. Xia ask you to do that this time?

584
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,230
Of course.

585
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,710
I stayed up late to finish it.

586
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,920
What is it?

587
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,280
Generally speaking, when the president
is on a business trip,

588
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,310
our administrative department
is supposed to arrange

589
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,760
his basic necessities of life.

590
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,000
But Mr. Xia said

591
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
he arranged Xing Yun to do it.

592
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,800
Xing Yun is really talented

593
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
in taking care of Mr. Xia.

594
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,590
Tell us about it.

595
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,760
Do you have any tips

596
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,800
to arrange schedule for Mr. Xia?

597
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,830
Very simple.

598
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,880
What he wants is not a schedule

599
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,000
but a guide to life.

600
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,160
What do you mean?

601
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,590
For example, book a flight ticket.

602
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,400
In addition to choosing the right time,

603
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,190
the choice of seat is also very important.

604
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,400
He always travels in first class.

605
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,430
What's the difference?

606
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,520
There's a big difference.

607
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,950
When Mr. Xia works on the plane,

608
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,190
he's most afraid of being disturbed by others.

609
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,110
So it's better to choose the position by the window.

610
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,310
So that nobody will come in and go out

611
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,070
to disturb him.

612
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
And?

613
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,160
The hotel should have a quiet environment.

614
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,520
Be sure to put lemon in the room

615
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,560
instead of fresh flowers.

616
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
He has a pollen allergy.

617
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,680
In order to ensure his quality of sleep,

618
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,800
the curtains are lightproof.

619
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,760
But the scenery outside the window
cannot be ignored.

620
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:35,710
Besides,

621
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,950
the pillow can't be too high or too soft.

622
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,040
Memory pillow is the best.

623
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
Anything else?

624
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,310
There must be a place near the hotel

625
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,680
which is suitable for night running.

626
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,230
With level road surface,
less branch roads and intersections.

627
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,070
It should be quiet with street lighting
and pleasant environment.

628
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,070
There should be a convenience store

629
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,280
away a 3-minute walk from the hotel.

630
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,640
So he can buy the beer he drinks the most.

631
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,920
He always drinks this brand of beer?

632
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,070
It's not tasty at all, wanna try it?

633
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,520
So why do you buy it?

634
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,400
Because it is expensive.

635
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,280
I need to spend money to relieve my pressure.

636
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,040
Give it to you!

637
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,000
Is there anything else?

638
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,800
And nearby cinema, pharmacy,

639
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,350
restaurant, pub, shopping mall,

640
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,160
nearest subway station and taxi station

641
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,190
should be near to his hotel.

642
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,470
I have to take all of these into account.

643
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,640
I finally understand that

644
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,680
detail determines one's fate.

645
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,880
OK, that's it.

646
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,230
Anyway, finally I can

647
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,920
handle my work

648
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
with nobody bothering me.

649
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,880
Come on! Cheers!

650
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,040
It's worth celebrating!

651
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,680
Yeah.

652
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
Cheers.

653
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,400
Wait.

654
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,070
Mr. He from Jiawo will come soon, right?

655
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,760
How is this guy?

656
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,950
I almost forgot this guy.

657
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,400
He...

658
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,350
Let's continue.

659
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,920
What's wrong with him?

660
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,430
Don't wanna talk about him.

661
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:09,950
Let's eat.

662
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Hello, I am He Yu from Jiawo.

663
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,920
Hello.

664
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,830
Register.

665
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,230
I don't want you to be punished
for missing the registration.

666
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,430
Mr. He.

667
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,760
Let me do it.

668
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,920
No, how could I bother you with it?

669
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,350
This is a man's job.

670
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,040
Thank you.

671
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,040
Put it over there.

672
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,800
Do it well.

673
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,000
Bye bye.

674
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,190
It's said that Mr. He
is the college mate of Mr. Xia.

675
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
But they have different styles.

676
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,800
Compared with sober Mr. Xia,

677
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,920
Mr. He is such a warm man.

678
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,040
He is just like a breath of spring wind.

679
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,590
Don't know that?

680
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,000
I heard that Mr. He

681
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,710
is a love master.

682
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,350
He's skilled at hitting on a girl.

683
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,070
Be careful, silly girl.

684
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,520
It's none of your business.

685
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,680
Mr. He, these are what I sort

686
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,070
about the instance of Infinite.

687
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,950
You can have a look.

688
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,400
Tell me if you need something.

689
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,800
As you said, anything I need.

690
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,640
Mr. Xia arranged me to

691
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,800
on your call at any time before he left.

692
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,590
So bring me a meal for lunch.

693
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,280
Anything is fine. I'm not a picky eater.

694
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,160
But I don't like chopped green onion, spicy food,

695
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,800
pluck or high-calorie food.

696
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm working out in fitness.

697
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,430
Mr. He! It's only 10:30 am.

698
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,390
Why don't we discuss about

699
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,230
the design firstly?

700
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,430
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

701
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,190
I mean,

702
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,040
hypoglycemia is not conducive to my thinking.

703
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,320
Right. Buy me some peppermint candy

704
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,360
and a cup of hot cocoa.

705
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,910
More sugar. More Cocoa.

706
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,520
Go ahead.

707
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,950
Xia Ke, you are amazing.

708
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,470
I don't know this restaurant even I am local.

709
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,910
Too authentic.

710
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,560
Because I have a secret weapon.

711
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,950
Come on! Cheers.

712
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,320
Where are you going to go after the exchange?

713
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,870
You can walk around.

714
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,040
Suzhou, Hangzhou, Anji
and Mogan Mount are good choices.

715
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,080
The weather here is comfortable in this season.

716
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,560
In a few days,

717
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,430
there is a Japanese game expo.

718
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,670
You might as well see it before you leave.

719
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,950
Remember to bring your secret weapon.

720
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,760
As you require, double sugar.

721
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,040
Mr. He, how long will you finish it?

722
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,230
It depends.

723
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,320
Anyway, it will not exceed 12 am.

724
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,600
Man also need keep in good health.

725
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
No matter how urgent it is,

726
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,280
it can't stop me from beauty sleep.

727
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,520
You can finish it before 12 am?

728
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,710
How is this possible?

729
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,120
Don't you know I just start to do it?

730
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,870
It will take me a week to finish it.

731
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,230
What have you been doing these days?

732
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,800
Heal my wound.

733
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,150
Maybe it's because of my head.

734
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,320
It's still not healed.

735
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,630
It hurts when I think.

736
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,470
So I just delay the process.

737
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,910
Then I will go back.

738
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,430
If my memory serves me right,

739
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,000
Mr. Xia arranged you

740
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,190
to assist me. Right?

741
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,560
So?

742
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Bring me a sticky note.

743
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:58,600
You!

744
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,150
Don't be angry.

745
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm not familiar because I first came here.

746
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
You should do me a little favor. Right?

747
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,190
Right?

748
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,600
So troublesome!

749
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,670
What happened?

750
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,080
Snake!

751
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,430
Where is the snake?

752
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,840
Keep away from it.
What if it is poisonous?

753
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,950
What should I do?

754
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,870
Lower your voice.

755
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,080
At this time we'd better keep quiet.

756
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,120
Generally it will not actively attack people.

757
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,560
What are you doing?

758
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,430
I'll cover it with my clothes.

759
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,710
Then we run to seek help
to security personnel.

760
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,470
Run!

761
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:03,840
No!

762
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Just run!

763
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,150
You really have a strong survival ability.

764
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,080
Last night in a bar,

765
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
I won this by playing darts.

766
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,560
I didn't think it is interesting.

767
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,150
But now it's different.

768
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,280
Is it so lifelike?

769
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,910
So you put this in the cabinet,

770
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,190
and ask me to find some sticky notes on purpose?

771
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,630
I am kidding you.

772
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,320
I didn't expect your reaction was so real.

773
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,630
You are quite brave.

774
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,150
No.

775
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,950
You are angry? Really?

776
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,120
Mr. He, I have no obligation

777
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,600
to play a joke with you.

778
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,360
Goodbye!

779
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,560
Mr. Xia.

780
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
Is there any place interesting in Shanghai?

781
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,470
Why are you slow in reacting today?

782
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,670
Mr. Xia, I come to plan game,

783
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,800
not make itinerary for

784
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,430
you.

785
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,000
If you suspect that I am slow in reacting,

786
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,630
well, please give me a pay rise.

787
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,280
I will react quickly with getting a raise.

788
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,320
It really pisses me off.

789
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,280
Morning!

790
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,040
Mr. He! Morning!

791
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,190
What are you looking at?

792
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,080
This notification.

793
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,120
From 9 pm to 12 am this evening,

794
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,600
it will power cut in this building for overhaul.

795
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,150
It seems that we have to come off work
early this evening.

796
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,910
This can show

797
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,150
clear upgrade structure,

798
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,430
but I won't use it as the main screen.

799
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,840
Because it requires the audience

800
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,950
to know this game well.

801
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,120
Its purpose is to screen potential players.

802
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,470
How about this one?

803
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,390
This and this.

804
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,870
As for core group,

805
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,800
we will use internal activity idea.

806
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,040
How about it?

807
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,280
Are you fascinated by me when I work?

808
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,320
I can understand.
Most girls will react like this.

809
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm not so superficial

810
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
to think talent is justice.

811
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,950
Next time could you

812
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,280
not ask me to attend a meeting temporarily?

813
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,520
I have my own work to do.

814
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,470
Good idea bursts out all of a sudden.

815
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,710
It's fleeting.

816
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,670
The power is off.

817
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,190
I'm too busy to forget the time.

818
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,710
The building is under electrical maintenance at 9 pm.

819
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,950
They must get off work in advance, right?

820
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,710
Let's call it a day. Mr. He.

821
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,600
Can you do me a favor?

822
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,320
What?

823
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,230
Accompany me to the office to get something.

824
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,670
Listen!

825
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,360
What's that sound?

826
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,360
Before I called you in,

827
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,280
I was watching a horror film in the office.

828
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
I forgot to close it when I came out.

829
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,710
What do you mean?

830
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,470
I mean that it is still playing.

831
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,150
I dare not go in alone.

832
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,150
You're a man! Are you afraid of ghosts?

833
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,560
You are not afraid?

834
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
I am not so childish.

835
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
If you are afraid of ghosts,
why do you watch horror film?

836
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,150
I dare watch it in the light!

837
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,320
It's so dark outside now.

838
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,950
What's the film you watched?

839
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,670
So long.

840
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,080
"Call Back Ghosts". Don't you know that?

841
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,950
One of the world's top 10 horror films.

842
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,040
It tells a story that in an abandoned building,

843
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,800
people often hear the miserable crying for help.

844
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,430
Don't say it anymore.

845
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't want to say it.

846
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,520
Check it quickly!

847
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,150
Ok, I am going home.

848
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,630
You, you, you, help me one more time.

849
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,190
It's supposed to be wonderful
to shop on weekends.

850
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,000
Why do I have to accompany you
to see these strange toys?

851
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,040
Toys?

852
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,800
All of these are Garage Kits!

853
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
You're working at a game company.

854
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,630
Could you have some common sense?

855
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,360
Go on!

856
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,390
After the power off that day,

857
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,760
what happened between you and Mr. He?

858
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,280
He is really a coward.

859
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,390
He said that because the parking lot is far,

860
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,670
he dared not walk alone at night.

861
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,190
So I sent him to the parking lot.

862
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,800
Xing Yun, I thought you were fooled by him.

863
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,560
What do you mean?

864
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,760
When I meet a handsome guy like Mr. He,

865
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,840
I will browse his social account.

866
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,870
I found his Weibo account.

867
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,150
I found that in 2012.

868
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,040
You're so metamorphosis.

869
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,190
I find it. See?

870
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,190
When he and Mr. Xia were in college,

871
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,150
they went to a haunted house in Japan.

872
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,870
See?

873
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,230
If he dared to go to that place,

874
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,710
how could he be a coward?

875
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,760
My gosh!

876
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,120
Is this man at the gate of the haunted house
with a victory sign

877
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,710
the same as the person

878
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,710
who pulled my clothes yesterday?

879
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
Is he schizophrenic?

880
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,040
I think he revenges you

881
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,600
because you hit his head before.

882
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,470
Xing Yun! Xing Yun! Come on!

883
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,230
Come over!

884
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,710
Soul limit.

885
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,800
2013 edition.

886
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,910
How much is this, Miss?

887
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,360
This is an exhibit, not for sale.

888
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,630
Miss, where do you buy this?

889
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,230
Hangzhou, from a Garage Kits shop
run by a Japanese.

890
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,120
Hangzhou? What's the address?

891
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,150
Let me write it to you later.

892
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,430
Mr. Xia, right?

893
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,280
A young lady named Xing

894
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,560
booked a car for you online.

895
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,040
Very beautiful, right?

896
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,360
Most visitors will go to the Bund
when they go to Shanghai.

897
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,840
This is a secret place to enjoy the night view.

898
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,230
I know that you like watching the night scene.

899
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,600
So I specially chose it for you.

900
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,600
Look there!

901
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,800
Under each light

902
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,470
is hidden a different life.

903
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,230
Are you satisfied with your current life, Mr. Xia?

904
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,040
I believe that you

905
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,760
must be very satisfied with your life.

906
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,630
But I am not very satisfied.

907
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,870
Because a few days ago,

908
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,430
I offended my boss.

909
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,600
I don't know if he will forgive me.

910
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,300
(Reply at once)

911
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Hello, Mr. Xia.

912
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,230
Well arranged.

913
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,150
So glad to see you are satisfied.

914
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,320
In addition, the itinerary of leisure tours
in Shanghai and surrounding places

915
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,630
is sent to your mailbox.

916
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,390
I don't remember

917
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,630
I give you a second salary.

918
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,280
We're so familiar.
No need to talk about salary.

919
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,000
Just buy me a Garage Kits by the way.

920
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,600
Garage Kits?
