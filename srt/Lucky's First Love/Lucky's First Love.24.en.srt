00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,630
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,480
Xing Yun,

4
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,310
come and sit here.

5
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,040
Drink some wine.

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,910
You're really...

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,910
So great.

8
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,240
Cheers.

9
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,160
Come on.

10
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,240
Drink some water. Stop drinking wine.

11
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Eat fruit.

12
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,830
Why did you drink so much wine?

13
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,000
You flush.

14
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,190
Miss Zhang is coming.

15
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,270
Group Leader Zhang.

16
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, drink a cup of wine.

17
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,080
Drink a cup of wine.

18
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,600
Thank you for your hard work today.

19
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,000
Miss Zhang,

20
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
today you have to tell us

21
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,080
what happened to that investment project.

22
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,520
I heard it almost fell through before,

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
but now how does it become

24
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,110
an annual key project stressed by Mr. Qin?

25
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
Yes. Tell us now.

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,030
We are all curious about it. Tell us now.

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,830
I read the appraisal report.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
You have one day

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,270
to change the result.

30
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,520
Zhang Sirui,

31
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,030
you've always been the most trusted
and intimate subordinate to me.

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,960
Regardless of your family background

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,550
and what happened

34
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
to you and Xia Ke,

35
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,320
absolutely I won't allow anyone

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
to influence the company's judgment

37
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,160
because of his personal feelings.

38
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,270
Mr. Qin.

39
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,360
This is what Xia Ke sent to me.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,720
In fact,

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,960
(Valuation Adjustment Mechanism)
whatever the result of your appraisal report is,

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,270
I will invest in him.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
I just want you

44
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,470
to save face for yourself.

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,830
Everyone has his own master card.

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,750
Fine. Fine.

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,630
Don't be jealous of such things.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,470
Do you know the relationship
between Miss Zhang and Mr. Xia?

49
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,880
What is it?

50
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,800
Tell us. Tell us.

51
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,510
I think

52
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
with a honey-trap,

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,640
Mr. Xia can break the investment record of TIG.

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,920
It's a good deal to gain investment
with such a trap.

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,550
We all know the family background of Mr. Xia,

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,390
so I think Leader Zhang is the life winner

57
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,670
who catches a billionaire happily.

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,510
I didn't think so much about it.

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,790
I just want everyone to be happy.

60
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,790
When you and Mr. Xia be a family,

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you'll be the one on the top
of the world among us.

62
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,200
Come on, let's drink.

63
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,110
Well. Toast. A toast to you.

64
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,320
Cheers.

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,160
Congratulations.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,640
Xing Yun,

67
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,640
where are you going?

68
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,440
Xing Yun. Xing Yun.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Drink more.

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,830
OK.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,670
Miss Zhang, take care of us more later.

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,950
Come on. Drink again.

73
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,510
TIG got the investment with its own strength.

74
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,200
Take back what you said

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,920
just now.

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,760
Don't insult Xia Ke like that.

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,230
What?

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,440
Do you still want to act that you're loyal?

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
When Xia Ke's family was in trouble

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,000
and he suffered, where were you?

81
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,390
You're just a pet around him.

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,320
You'll never be accepted by the Xia Family.

83
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,670
At least I won't

84
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,600
insult his dream

85
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,350
and eradicate his efforts like you.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,550
At least I haven't approached him

87
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,790
with purpose for his status and background.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
Pet?

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,670
What's wrong with the pet?

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,320
The pet is the most sincere animal in the world.

91
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,880
It won't make choice or care about meaning.

92
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,880
As long as it identifies its owner,

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,830
it'll stay with him all its life.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,670
Trust will always be around him.

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,440
The cat you abandoned before

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,950
still knows you after so many years, right?

97
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,720
Even if Xia Ke

98
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,230
really regards me as a pet,

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,920
my love is more sincere

100
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,720
and noble than yours.

101
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,070
If he chooses you instead of me,

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
he is blind.

103
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,510
Stay away from my fiancée.

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,480
Mr. Xia is really handsome.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I really like you.

106
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,950
Kiss me.

107
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,950
Go.

108
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,920
OK.

109
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,950
Good morning, Mr. Xing, Mrs. Xing.

110
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,350
Are, are you here

111
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,880
to, to pick Xing Yun up?

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,670
She left early in the morning.

113
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
Then I'm leaving.

114
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,760
Wait.

115
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,230
Listen, young man,

116
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,600
if you still let her drink,

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,550
drink so much wine...

118
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,350
Ah...

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,390
Drink less. Drink less.

120
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,600
We've already talked about

121
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,790
the launch time with the channel side.

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,270
It'll probably take more than twenty days.

123
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,230
When will software testing be completed?

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Hu said he would try to make it in this week.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,830
Let's have lunch together this noon.

126
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,760
I booked the restaurant you like.

127
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,110
Is there any comment from other departments?

128
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,600
Mr. Xia, what else do you want to say?

129
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,920
Game discussion boards do need warm-up in advance

130
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,110
to increase bonding.

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,910
What do you mean?

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,320
You said you forget everything you said

133
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,110
at the signing party that day.

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,400
In the presence of looker-on employees
from both companies

135
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
and Mr. Xia,

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,670
you expressed your love to him

137
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,470
face to face.

138
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,440
Stop.

139
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
I was too drunk that day.

140
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
I don't want to know

141
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,350
anything ridiculous I did.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,550
So what is the relationship

143
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,710
between you and Mr. Xia now?

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Waiter, add dishes.

145
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,470
There is too much food to eat.

146
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,840
It's wasteful to order more.

147
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Yes. Too much.

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,080
I want this, this

149
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,350
and a bottle of these noodles.

150
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,320
All for taking away. Thank you.

151
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,960
Amy, can you please take these

152
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,840
to the President Office later?

153
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
Now you care that

154
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,470
he doesn't have lunch.

155
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,760
No.

156
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,110
Originally, he booked a restaurant

157
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,080
to have lunch with me this noon,

158
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,280
but I agreed you first,

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,440
so I didn't reply to his message.

160
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

161
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,150
You stand

162
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,840
Mr. Xia up for us.

163
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,280
We made an appointment first.

164
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,640
By the way, I have to send

165
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,350
materials to Jiawo this afternoon.

166
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,030
I'm leaving.

167
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,960
Remember to take food to him for me.

168
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,470
We're finished.

169
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,520
What does she mean?

170
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,150
Is she entrapping us?

171
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,280
We're finished. Do you know?

172
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,150
I don't understand.

173
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,670
Finally, you're back.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,520
What's wrong?

175
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,400
Mr. Xia asked me to wait here

176
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,470
and tell you to go to his office

177
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,000
as soon as you come back.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,320
I even didn't dare to have lunch.

179
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,910
What is the food you take here?

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
It's the only thing that

181
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,880
can save us now.

182
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,550
Last time as I said a few good words
for Manager He,

183
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,230
Mr. Xia punished me to sum up

184
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,840
game materials in the past ten years.

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,710
Wow.

186
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,670
(President's Office)

187
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,440
Mr. Xia, this is what Xing Yun ordered for you.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,760
She ordered for me?

189
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,280
Yes, Mr. Xia.

190
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,080
Well, Mr. Xia, you also know

191
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,710
Xing Yun has a bad memory.

192
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,150
When having lunch with us, she remembered

193
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,840
she should have dated you.

194
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,710
So she specially ordered your favorite food.

195
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
Try it while it's still hot.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,710
If there is nothing else, we're leaving.

197
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,710
Mr. Xia, take your time to enjoy it.

198
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,910
Wait.

199
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,150
Come back.

200
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,710
You can read tarot cards, right?

201
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes.

202
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,760
Read them and tell me what she is thinking.

203
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,400
Mr. Xia, we can't tell that with tarot cards.

204
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,400
Then find me

205
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,960
the one who can.

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,400
Mr. Xia, if you want to know

207
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,550
what she is thinking,

208
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,200
how about watching some psychodramas,

209
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,280
like “Lie to Me,”

210
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,960
“In Treatment”

211
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,440
and criminal psychology series?

212
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,320
Mr. Xia, recently I also read

213
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,230
a time-travel novel.

214
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,910
The hero is a master teacher
who can predict the future.

215
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,640
The heroine also has superpowers.

216
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,790
Are you two kidding me?

217
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,670
Mr. Xia, how about proposing to her directly?

218
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,030
Mr. Xia, propose to her.

219
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes, that day

220
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,200
you called her your fiancée

221
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,110
in the presence of so many people.

222
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,030
It'll be inappropriate if you don't

223
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,760
propose to her decently.

224
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,000
Hu.

225
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,350
Hu.

226
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
Why is our company so strange today?

227
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,790
Where have all the girls gone?

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,590
They have been

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,200
asked to do research on new games.

230
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,200
Why didn't you go?

231
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,440
Research?

232
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,790
No one told me. Who organizes it?

233
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,110
Mr. Xia.

234
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,840
No one else has such great appeal except him.

235
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,110
I see.

236
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,640
Has Mr. Xia never

237
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,320
regarded you as a girl?

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,760
Listen.

239
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,400
Definitely our company is going to

240
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,670
develop a very feminine game.

241
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Who says I'm not feminine?

242
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,760
What?

243
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,710
Let's play together. Don't cry if you lose.

244
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,350
I'm not afraid of you. Come on.

245
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,350
Mr. Xia, I got an idea.

246
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,470
What?

247
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,030
Dancing flash mobs.

248
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,440
Why hasn't Mengmeng come yet?

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Next. Next. Next.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,760
I got an idea.

251
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
My key words are

252
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,670
big screen, rose and focus.

253
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,080
Marry me.

254
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Sorry, Mr. Xia.

255
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,910
I forgot you were allergic to pollen.

256
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,960
Mr. Xia, don't bother.

257
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,880
Amy and Yiyi are close friends of Xing Yun.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,790
They can just ask her

259
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,200
what kind of proposal style she likes.

260
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
I'll repeat it again.

261
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,080
What we did today is a top-secret market research.

262
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,550
If any of you leak the news,

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,150
you won't get your year-end awards.

264
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,230
By the way, change Group B for me.

265
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,910
Don't. Don't, Mr. Xia.

266
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,030
Give us some more time.

267
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,200
We're sure to come up with it.

268
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,550
Come up, think about it.

269
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,760
Beautiful girl,

270
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,760
can you finish a questionnaire for us?

271
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,670
Thank you.

272
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,710
Brand and style of wedding rings,
most popular with girls.

273
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,910
Are you a wedding company?

274
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,960
We are a game company.

275
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Please finish it.

276
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,440
Guys in Group B,

277
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,590
let me remind you.

278
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,110
We'll go off work in three hours.

279
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,000
35% of the 500 questionnaires

280
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,880
hasn't been finished yet.

281
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,670
If you don't want to work overtime
or suffer, work hard now.

282
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,470
Thus, with several hundred questionnaires

283
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,230
and all-round data support,

284
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
finally such a moment is coming to girls in TIG

285
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,640
who have suffered a lot recently.

286
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Here's live report from the scene by Amy.

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Mr. Xia

288
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,840
is going to propose soon.

289
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,430
Mr. Xia is so handsome.

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,310
He is just like heroes

291
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,070
in Korean dramas.

292
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,800
What happens to Xing Yun

293
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,590
is really like that of idol dramas.

294
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,520
She is so lucky.

295
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,230
Is this the hidden plot

296
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,400
of Infinite that you want to discuss with me?

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Do you like it?

298
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,070
It's somewhat like “Up.”

299
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,680
The most magnificent adventure is to be with you.

300
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,280
Xing Yun,

301
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,920
marry me.

302
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,950
Marry him.

303
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,800
Marry him.

304
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
Marry him.

305
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,560
What's going on?

306
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,230
It keeps me in suspense.

307
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,880
Let me call her.

308
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,640
Sorry, the subscriber you dial is power off.

309
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,470
Her phone is off.

310
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,280
My cell phone makes me furious.

311
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,920
At such a critical moment,

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,640
it's dead.

313
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,880
Later?

314
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,800
Later I stood there

315
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
alone watching

316
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,590
my handsome boss being heartbroken.

317
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,230
You mean he was rejected by Xing Yun.

318
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,950
She accepted all balloons

319
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,920
except that diamond ring.

320
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,920
I really want to see
what he looked like back then.

321
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Is it so happy to gossip about me
during working hours?

322
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,070
Mr. Xia, I'm leaving for my work.

323
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,560
I am your Party A.

324
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,310
All is fine, Brother.

325
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,880
I've had the same experience like you.

326
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,070
This is unavoidable.

327
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,110
But I heard that

328
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,470
you have already lived with Yao Qing.

329
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,110
Yes.

330
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,920
As to progress,

331
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,190
I'm a step ahead of you.

332
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,070
However,

333
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,430
she still hasn't accepted it.

334
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
You even take it with you.

335
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,760
Sure.

336
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,430
Chances only favor prepared minds!

337
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,000
Whenever we feel it's appropriate,
we should try to propose.

338
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,880
Do you think I didn't try?

339
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,430
Do you like this cup?

340
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,680
Is it pretty?

341
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,710
A grey-and-white kitchen

342
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,350
will be a good match to it.

343
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,760
By the way, my kitchen is grey and white.

344
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,760
Why don't you move in?

345
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,710
No. Illicit cohabitation

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,190
will be gossiped about easily.

347
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,110
Let's get a marriage license,

348
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,040
so as to stop others from gossiping.

349
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,950
It's a good match to my kitchen.

350
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,070
Your computer isn't working.

351
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,000
Restore hard disk and all is fine.

352
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,880
I know, but...

353
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,040
Generally speaking,

354
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,830
girls are not as good at such things

355
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,230
as boys do.

356
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,590
But few boys will be at your back and call

357
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,680
except your husband.

358
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,310
Hu, my computer doesn't work.

359
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,830
I'm in my seat.

360
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,470
Thanks, Mr. Xia.

361
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,800
Mr. Xia, here are the eye drops, tea

362
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,950
and mosquito repellent for your business trip.

363
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,800
I put them here for you.

364
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
There are so many temptations outside.

365
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Don't you worry about me?

366
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,310
I heard that marriage

367
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,070
is an effective way to bind men.

368
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,230
In this regard, I think rope will work better.

369
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,280
Should I prepare it for you?

370
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,760
I didn't expect that

371
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,830
Xing Yun seemingly innocent at ordinary times

372
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,040
is more destructive than Yao Qing.

373
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,950
Brother, I have an idea for you.

374
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,230
I think we can just knock them out

375
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,040
and take them to entrance
to civil affairs bureau directly.

376
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,190
I think that's a good idea.

377
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,400
Very good, right?

378
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,880
The one intentionally injuring others' body

379
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,190
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment
of not more than three years

380
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,430
or criminal detention or control.

381
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,560
If you kidnap, it'll be a more serious crime.

382
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,350
Why are you here?

383
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,280
If I don't come here,

384
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,190
I won't know what

385
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,560
you two are up to.

386
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
I don't come here alone.

387
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,470
Someone also came to see you.

388
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,590
Xia Ke,

389
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,920
I came to you by the earliest plane.

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
I have to work.

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,830
What's up?

392
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,400
I specially come here to extend my regard.

393
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,920
You look somewhat disappointed.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,070
With the excuse of visiting me,

395
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,590
obviously you come here for relaxing.

396
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,230
You know me.

397
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,040
What do you think?

398
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,880
I designed this illustration.

399
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,920
It'll be cooler with lightning in the evening.

400
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,230
Now it reminds me of the time

401
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,680
when we worked together before.

402
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,310
What? Are you going to be Manager Yao

403
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
and guide me in my work?

404
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,800
As you mentioned it,

405
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,920
I also feel that

406
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,830
the setting is somewhat strange.

407
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,590
He Yu.

408
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,230
Be gentle. It hurts.

409
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,590
The wound on the back has been treated.

410
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Try not to get it wet in following days.

411
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,800
No one received an anaesthetic
to treat such a minor injury.

412
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,520
Uncle He Yu isn't brave at all.

413
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,310
Yes.

414
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,800
Xiaoxi, you can't learn from him.

415
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,310
I never cry after an injection.

416
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,280
Go.

417
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,470
I, I can't put it on.

418
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
Are you very touched?

419
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,110
You saved me before.

420
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Now I save you.

421
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,800
If you still don't agree to marry me,

422
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,950
it won't make sense.

423
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,470
I didn't ask you to save me.

424
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,160
She practices kendo

425
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,680
so she is more agile than you.

426
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,830
What do you mean?

427
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,950
If you didn't try to save her,

428
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,000
no one will be hurt today.

429
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,280
No. Are you

430
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,560
still sympathetic?

431
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
OK. Put an end to it.

432
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,110
Now go back and rest.

433
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,640
Am I very stupid?

434
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,710
You, you wear it.

435
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,950
It fell out of your pocket on the way here.

436
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,310
I can't let you

437
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,430
put such a precious thing
in your pocket all the time

438
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,680
and lose it.

439
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Be careful.

440
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,000
Not for children.

441
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
Be careful.

442
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,070
Take care of Xiaoxi for me first.

443
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,880
Xia Ke, come here.

444
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,350
Little gooseberry.

445
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,760
Come on. I still want to hug you.

446
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,190
Hurry up. I still want to hug you.

447
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,280
Be careful.

448
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,230
Be careful.

449
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,040
Envy? You can, too.

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,800
The ruse of self-injury.

451
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,040
Forget it. I don't want to make her worry.

452
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,470
Then you have to ask me for

453
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,590
some inside information.

454
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,830
Do you remember

455
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,680
the first time you came to make a cake?

456
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,920
Sure.

457
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,520
Back then someone said that I was so clumsy

458
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,950
that I didn't look like an art learner.

459
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,590
As an art learner,

460
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,680
you are even so clumsy.

461
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,230
I...

462
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Actually, after you left,

463
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,880
the silly boy who said you were clumsy

464
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,160
tasted the cake you dropped on the table secretly.

465
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,350
Really?

466
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,470
During that time, my grandma was in hospital.

467
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,880
Director Su was so aggressive that

468
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,920
he wanted to occupy the company's

469
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
shares by acquisition.

470
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,950
We were attacked from all sides and anxious.

471
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,710
Director Su was really troublesome.

472
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,280
Also media reporters

473
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,800
kept an eye on my family.

474
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,430
Xia Ke stayed away from you for protecting you.

475
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,160
Zhang Sirui

476
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,710
went to my family every day,

477
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,160
but Xia Ke didn't meet her.

478
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,830
Instead, she drank almost all tea in my family.

479
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,880
OK. I admit that

480
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm very angry at the matter of him and Zhang Sirui.

481
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,560
But I'm angry that

482
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,800
he didn't believe me

483
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,560
instead of tidbits everywhere.

484
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,920
As I choose to be with him,

485
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,280
will I be afraid of being disturbed?

486
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,070
Will I be his soft spot

487
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,000
that the enemy would take advantage of?

488
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,310
In his heart,

489
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,070
am I the one who should stand behind him

490
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,040
and be protected by him

491
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,280
instead of the one who can support him

492
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,590
and fight together with him?

493
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,400
For girls,

494
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,710
being needed and relied on

495
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,280
is also a sense of security.

496
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,310
So there is a long way for you to go

497
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,430
to turn into her husband

498
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,070
from her boss.

(Different kinds of questions from Reply at once)

500
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,640
Well, don't play cell phone.

501
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,280
Your cervical spine isn't in a good condition.

502
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,310
Do you want to be hospitalized?

503
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,520
No, Mom.

504
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,190
There are a few questions I don't understand.

505
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,000
What are they? I can tell you.

506
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,160
Well, if you have five million yuan in cash

507
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,000
for managing,

508
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,110
will you buy a fund or trust it?

509
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,190
And if you want to change a new car

510
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
at one-million-yuan level,

511
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
do you value its luxury, performance

512
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,520
or maneuverability and horsepower?

513
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,000
Xing Yun, don't, don't scare me.

514
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
Did you win the lottery?

515
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
No, perhaps

516
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,280
something is wrong with Xia Ke.

517
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
He asks me all things,

518
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,470
from financial management plans

519
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
to colors of T-shirts and what to have for lunch.

520
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,350
I doubt whether he is afraid to make a choice.

521
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,040
Go next door and choose for him.

522
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,680
Next door?

523
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Yes.

524
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,350
Isn't there a new buyer for next door?

525
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,640
I also heard that.

526
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,350
Do you have nothing to explain to me?

527
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,800
You mean this house?

528
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,880
Yes, I bought it,

529
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,070

530
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,880

I don't mean that.

532

Zhang Sirui?

533
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,040
I've clarified it on media websites.

534
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,920
And I have urged Mr. Qin to send

535
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,070
her back to the US.

536
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
What's that?

537
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,110
I mean this.

538
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,470
It doesn't look like the one I made at all.

539
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,070
You are so clumsy.

540
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,560
Are you really a perfectionist?

542
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:05,950
OK.

the number of active users per month

increased by 42.9% year-on-year.

also shows an upward trend.

Xia Ke excluded me from the project group.

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,110
Everyone laughs at me.

563
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,710
It seems to have nothing to do with Xia Ke.

564
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,070
Excuse me.

565
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Don't you think you didn't separate
the public from the private?

566
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,430
In this regard,

567
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,920
no one seems to be superior to you.

568
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,710
Do you think after I leave,

569
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,710
you can live happily and peacefully

570
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,560
all your life with Xia Ke?

571
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,190
You are too naive.

572
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,000
Xia Ke is such an excellent man that

573
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,470
he'll always be in the spotlight
wherever he goes.

574
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,470
What do you think you can do

575
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,800
to defeat so many women

576
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,350
who want to be with him in the world ?

577
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,400
How strange you are!

578
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,800
Why should I defeat others?

579
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,560
Isn't our happiness

580
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
decided by

581
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,000
our own hands?

582
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm satisfied with your performance now,

583
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,880
but I don't agree that Xing Yun

584
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,950
will be the future leader of Infinite.

585
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,040
Instead of being promoted,

586
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,040
she should leave the project team of Infinite.

587
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,350
Why?

588
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,110
You kicked away Zhang Sirui,

589
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,110
my best subordinate.

590
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,190
Can I revenge on Xing Yun?

591
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,640
Given the relationship between you and Xing Yun,

592
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,350
I don't think

593
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,950
you can be completely fair

594
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,880
to her work.

595
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,400
Once someone tries to seek private gain
from this project,

596
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,880
it may be the biggest hidden danger

597
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,400
in the future of the project.

598
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,950
I understand your concerns.

599
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,230
But Xing Yun has

600
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,040
been dedicated to this game.

601
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,760
I can never let her leave.

602
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,800
I have to remind you.

603
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,160
You seem to have forgotten

604
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,950
who is the boss between you and me.

605
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,840
Sure.

606
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,000
You can go back to where you were.

607
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,390
It's no big deal that we split up.

608
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,190
I also heard that

609
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,760
your sister inherits the whole family business.

610
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,390
You're not short of money.

611
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,430
However, as our project has just hit the market,

612
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
it'll be embarrassing

613
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,910
if we can't get along at this critical moment.

614
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,390
I didn't ask you to fire her.

615
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,360
You don't have to answer me now.

616
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,670
Go back and think about it.

617
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,670
Are you all right?

618
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
Yes.

619
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,910
But I find you've been depressed

620
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,000
after meeting Mr. Qin.

621
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
What did he say to you?

622
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,710
I'm really fine.

623
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,840
What, what's wrong?

624
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,230
Go with me.

625
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,950
Xing Yun,

626
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,320
tell Mr. Qin

627
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,390
the whole process of your participation
in the game Infinite

628
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,150
and your passion for it.

629
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,430
Mr. Qin thinks

630
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,190
our relationship

631
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,430
may make me

632
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,840
lose my judgment on this project.

633
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,080
If I don't agree,

634
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,670
he may quit.

635
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,870
That's possible.

636
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
I think the most important thing
for a game manager

637
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,080
is not only her ability

638
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
but also her love for the game.

639
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,280
I think no one in the company

640
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,870
loves this game more than Xing Yun does.

641
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,910
Xing Yun, prove it to Mr. Qin by yourself.

642
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,520
Hahaha.

643
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,760
Dad, you lose.

644
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Give me money.

645
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,710
OK. Admit defeat for bet.

646
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,630
Though I lose, I'm happy.

647
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,760
We're tricked?

648
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,520
It isn't a trick,

649
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,120
but a test.

650
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,040
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

651
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,670
What's going on?

652
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,320
I just want to know

653
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,280
if you finally learn to believe me

654
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
and believe that I can get what I want

655
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,280
with my own strength.

656
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,670
Xia Ke, I have no choice.

657
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,560
As my dear daughter asked me for help,

658
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,870
I could just pretend to be

659
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,470
a mercenary and unreasonable villain.

660
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,390
Xia Ke, are you angry?

661
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,630
If so,

662
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,150
I apologize to you.

663
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
I know that I shouldn't test you,

664
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,560
but I want you to know that

665
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,800
trust

666
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,470
doesn't mean you ask me the color of suits to wear,

667
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,950
the style of ties to buy

668
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,670
what to have for lunch,

669
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,670
beef rice or chicken rice,

670
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,390
or if I like sport cars or closed cars.

671
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,280
Instead, it means you will

672
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,000
tie your life to mine.

673
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,950
We'll move in and out together.

674
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,150
Now I think it's great

675
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,320
to have somebody to share it with me.

676
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you all right?

677
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,040
I won.

678
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,000
You said that as long as I made progress,

679
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
I would be rewarded.

680
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,520
I think you're better at acting shamelessly.

681
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,520
This is called nothing is too deceitful in war.

682
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,670
This is called sophistry.

683
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,870
OK.

684
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,910
Tell me what rewards you want.

685
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,390
Do you know Yao Qing and He Yu

686
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,040
have decided to get married?

687
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,390
So I have promised Yao Qing

688
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,870
to attend our wedding.

689
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,560
OK.

690
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,320
Wait. Who is attending our wedding?

691
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,000
Will you always like me?

692
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,840
I'll let you know

693
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,000
if there's any change

694
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,710
about the matter that I like you,

695
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
but it'll never happen

696
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,230
for the rest of your life.

697
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,870
You are not allergic today.

698
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,080
You have sent so many flowers,

699
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,320
but don't you know
there is preserved fresh flower?

700
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,000
You know what?

701
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Yao Qing once swore to aurora borealis
in Norway that

702
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,840
she would walk into the palace of marriage with you,

703
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,280
otherwise she would keep single all her life.

704
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,600
Helplessly,

705
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,230
we can only marry on the same day with you

706
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,320
to break the promise.

707
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,870
As a man,

708
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,870
you even don't mind that.

709
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,000
Nonsense.

710
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,040
It'll be lively and exciting enough

711
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,230
to marry on the same day with good brother.

712
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,320
But, Xia Ke,

713
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,630
I should apologize to you.

714
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,360
After all, I was so selfish that

715
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,560
I tried to destroy your feelings.

716
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,150
As to that,

717
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,560
you don't have the strength.

718
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,280
Anyway, no one can take away
whatever belongs to me.

719
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,000
You're really…

720
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,870
They are coming.

721
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,280
Brides, grooms, please exchange your rings.

722
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,120

I read some words before that

740
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,040
one has to reject 37% of people

741
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,390
he first meets in his life

742
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,560
before he meets his true love.

743
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,320
So?

744
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,840
So I don't think

745
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,670
first love is the first one we date,

746
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,430
but the first one we really love.

747
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,710
Do you remember

748
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,190
the hidden plot in Instance Zones of Infinite
I told you?

749
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,320
You just made it up casually for

750
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,040
tricking me to the restaurant…

751
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,950
Is there really a hidden plot?

752
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,120
Many people think that

753
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,950
wedding is the end of the love game.

754
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,630
But I asked Hu and other colleagues

755
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,760
to set a new scene outside the church.

756
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,120
Only those lucky enough
to walk out of the church

757
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,600
have a chance to trigger it.

758
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,910
Like me now.

759
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,080
So do you want to trigger a new plot?

760
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,230
I'll try.

761
00:44:59,150 --> 00:44:59,760
I want a divorce.

762
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,670
Nonsense.

763
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,080
You don't love me at all.

764
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,840
I love you.

765
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,870
So why don't you let me in the guest room

766
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,230
since I moved in?

767
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,040
Dear, let me cut you an orange.

768
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:11,840
No.

769
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,080
Try some.

770
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,520
Well,

771
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,120
I'll show you something, OK?

772
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,390
I might have been so happy

773
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,520
when I first married you that

774
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,760
I did a silly thing.

775
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,190
I've been looking forward to our baby.

776
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,760
Then don't hide it from me.

777
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,040
I also want a baby.

778
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,040
I'm worried that you don't want to

779
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,430
be a dad at an early age out of work reason.

780
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,600
Really?

781
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,800
What, what are you doing?

782
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,950
Now that we both want a baby,

783
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,910
let's move without delay.

784
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,150
Xia Ke.

785
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,560
You're really heavy.
