00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,580
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
My idol's room is exactly the same

4
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,480
as I imagined.

5
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,800
Abstinence-styled in decoration

6
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,880
and with a little bit of sex appeal.

7
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,760
Come on!

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
He is your bestie's boyfriend now.

9
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,360
Keep your greedy eyes off him.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,440
Excuse me. I just forgot myself.

11
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
This is also gorgeous!

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Is it earthquake?

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Stop!

14
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,520
Hold it!

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,560
Stay put!

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
Wow, Mr. Xia's bed!

17
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,600
So this is Mr. Xia's luxurious grand cloakroom.

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,440
So many ties.

19
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,240
This brand is so expensive.

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,440
Xing Yun, shall we give it up?

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,600
No way!

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's start it now!

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,720
You see?

24
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Come on!

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,720
The sheet!

26
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Xing Yun, did you pick this?

27
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
The expression he will have when he sees this.

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
Xing Yun, look at this.

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
Mr. Xia will be like this...

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,360
Stop kidding! This would be his expression.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,720
No, this will be it.

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,680
Wow, this is so adorable.

33
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,640
Xu Yiyi,

34
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,040
do you think Mr. Xia will be mad

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,720
when he finds out

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,840
we turned his house into this?

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,480
How could Xing Yun come up with this idea?!

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,400
In the world of romance,

39
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
people just get unrestrained
once they're lavished with love.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Judging from how bold she is,

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,240
we can tell how Mr. Xia pampered her in general.

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
What's this on the picture?

43
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,880
A cat.

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,520
This cat is very expensive.

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:03,960
Really?

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,160
It is super cute.

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
It's a good breed.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,920
Look! It's very cute!

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,680
A kitten in the picture.

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,880
So cute! Whose is it?

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,280
We don't know. We found it between the sofa.

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,720
Right here!

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
Perhaps it's his friend's.

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
Any more pictures?

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,480
Let me figure it out.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Why does it look so familiar?

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,280
There isn't any more left.

59
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
Where are you going?

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,280
Wait for me!

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,040
I knew it!

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Mr. Xia asked me to book a bed the other day,

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,520
but it wasn't the one from the picture.

64
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,080
Wait a second.

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
What do you mean?

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,000
(Reply at once)

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
What are you up to?

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
Nothing!

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,880
You must be missing me,

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
but too shy to speak it out loud.

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
Not really.

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,320
It's early in the morning there, isn't it?

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Are you going out?

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
Yeah, it's early in the morning.

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,440
Mr. Qin invited me to go with him
to buy a private plane.

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,040
He wants me to be his first guest.

77
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
Private plane?

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,920
So you have made a deal with him.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Right?

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, I have,

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
but the process is beyond description.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,200
By the way, I have a question to ask.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Yeah?

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
Have you ever got a cat?

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah.

86
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,920
When was that? Why didn't you let me know?

87
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Oh, don't you know that?

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
It is a round fluffy abandoned cat,

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
both thriving to the family and interesting.

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,360
Oh, right! You'll see it
when you look into the mirror.

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm not kidding with you.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,640
He is knocking on my door.

93
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,600
I've gotta go.

94
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,320
Take a good rest. I'll call you tomorrow.

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,920
What's the point of going back?

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
You'll get nothing but being friendzoned.

97
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
You might as well be a nice guy out here.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,480
But we have a lot of business to do recently.

99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,080
We barely finish our own project.

100
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Yet, we have to take over Manager Yao's work.

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,320
What?!

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,320
No!

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,280
From today on,

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
we'd better

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
draw a neat line with them.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
Not needed.

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
Manager Yao has already resigned.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He Yu, where are you going?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
cannot be reached.

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
Please dial again later.

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
(Jiawo Media Advertising Company)

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,600
I've been absent for a few days.

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,840
That doesn't mean you can bully my teammate.

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,760
I have no clue about what you are talking about.

115
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
Why did Yao Qing resign?

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
Did you force her?

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,120
Those who should leave stayed,

118
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,720
and those who should stay left.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
So you planned to leave

120
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
from the very start.

121
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
What are the odds!
Don't you want to have some fun?

122
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,080
I feel that life is so dull.

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
I want something thrilling.

124
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Sure. I have prepared it.

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,160
This cocktail is named as "tomorrow",

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
because after you take it,

127
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,200
you will realize

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,880
it's already tomorrow.

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,840
Really?

130
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
Do you know what it likes

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,800
to really love someone?

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Sorry, I can't.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,680
This is not the thrill I want.

134
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,240
Half an hour left before boarding.

135
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Let's meet after I go back.

136
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
You need to report such trivial matters
to your girlfriend?

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
She's quite tight on you.

138
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
It works between families.

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
I've lost the feeling of being concerned

140
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
for more than 20 years.

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Families?

142
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
After the incident of TIG,

143
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
I'll propose to her.

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
I really appreciate you more and more

145
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,480
as an affectionate person,

146
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,080
just like when I was young.

147
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,600
Trust me!

148
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
I bought this plane

149
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,320
for my wife.

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,760
She likes travelling around the world.

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,600
So I gift her a plane.

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,800
But I figured out a principle

153
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
from all these years of in and out and arguing.

154
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,400
Never give a lady

155
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,680
what you think is the best,

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,760
but the thing she wants the most.

157
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Mr. Qin, your return is long-waited.

158
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,480
Stop it!

159
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
It's always the same words

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,120
no matter who comes to pick me up.

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,960
The earth

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,920
will rotate just the same without me.

163
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
Mr. Qin, could you introduce him to me?

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
This is Mr. Xia from TIG.

165
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
He has contacted Manager Xu

166
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,680
from investment department.

167
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,600
Manager Xu is on a long-term leave.

168
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,680
It seems his Dad is sick.

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Is it serious?

170
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
It's said to be cancer.

171
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,080
He won't be back in a short while.

172
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,240
Alright then.

173
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,720
Tell him

174
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,240
to take good care of his father.

175
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
After you get back,

176
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,280
transfer Zhang Sirui's group here immediately

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
for TIG project.

178
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,520
Lucky you, Xia Ke.

179
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
The assessment team I give you

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,720
is the best team in Tiange.

181
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,400
Thank you!

182
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,000
Do you need a ride?

183
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,080
No, I've got my own pickup.

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,040
OK.

185
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,680
Let's go!

186
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Long time no see.

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Don't you feel tired to stare at me like that?

188
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Tell me about the progress in these days...

189
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,600
We have 2 more colleagues coming back this week.

190
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,360
The revised sample of Instance Zones is also live now.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Everyone has restored

192
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
to the regular working hours.

193
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Just waiting for your acceptance check.

194
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,840
I want you

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,280
to report on my girlfriend.

196
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240
All good. Nothing worth of any description.

197
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,280
Did anyone send you flowers?

198
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,880
How is that possible?

199
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Then did anyone send you gifts?

200
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Neither!

201
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
Did anyone ask you out for dinner?

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Mr. Xia,

203
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
don't you feel bored

204
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
to ask these questions every day?

205
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
It's been 9 hours already

206
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,800
since I asked these last time.

207
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,760
That's only enough for me to have a sleep.

208
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,040
Speaking of sleep,

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,960
don't you need a sleep?

210
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
You've got work to do in the company.

211
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,080
The time difference won't be a problem to me.

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,560
Don't worry!

213
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,160
You'll have a good rest tonight.

214
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,800
Welcome Mr. Xia's victorious return.

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,080
Welcome!

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,200
It's still too early to say it's a victory.

217
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,200
We must be fully prepared

218
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,800
for the last battle.

219
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,680
Everybody, go for it!

220
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,360
Yeah!

221
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,800
Yeah!

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,680
Amy.

223
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,560
Come here.

224
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
The assessment team of Tiange

225
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,280
will join TIG next week.

226
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
Get prepared for it.

227
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,120
The team leader is called Zhang Sirui.

228
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,520
Check out her flight details.

229
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,360
Sure!

230
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,520
Thanks!

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
What?

232
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,160
Mr. Xia, I found you become very sweet

233
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,040
since you fell in love with Xing Yun.

234
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
So you told them about it?

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,880
Don't worry! I'll keep it a secret.

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,400
Excuse me!

237
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Very good!

238
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Are you going back?

239
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Will you come with me?

240
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm no boss.

241
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
I can't be so free to leave at any time.

242
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,000
By the way,

243
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,440
I need to tell you something.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm afraid you have to
find another place to live tonight.

245
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,400
What does that mean?

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,880
After you left,

247
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,880
I cleaned the room next to it.

248
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,160
The cleaning hasn't finished yet.

249
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,760
The curtain is still at the laundry shop.

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,680
The mattress is still out for dedusting.

251
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,160
When can I live there then?

252
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,800
I'll let you know.

253
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,600
Find a place for rest.

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,000
You must be very tired

255
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,880
after such a long journey and a whole day's work.

256
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,440
Alright!

257
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,800
Go!

258
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,640
Off I go!

259
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,320
Go!

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,480
Off I go!

261
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
The buyer

262
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,160
used the date of our first meeting

263
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,440
as the password.

264
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
What a coincidence!

265
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
Obviously, you don't have no place to go,

266
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,040
but you lied to me!

267
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,720
I never said

268
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
I have no place to go.

269
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,040
Why didn't you refuse it

270
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,960
when I said you sold the house?

271
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
And you changed the password.

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,800
I did sell an apartment,

273
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
except that it is not this one.

274
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
And the password was changed

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,640
while you were still with He Yu.

276
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,520
Stop quibbling!

277
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,480
Do you know what's most important in a relationship?

278
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,520
Sincerity!

279
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,400
No matter what happened, no lying!

280
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
That's basic principle.

281
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,920
How can you not know that
since you have so much experience of romance?

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
I don't have much experience.

283
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,440
Is that my point?

284
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,800
My point is why did you lie.

285
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,440
I wanted to come closer to you.

286
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Nothing was clear back then.

287
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,360
You had Chu Nan one day,

288
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,640
and He Yu next day,

289
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
and probably Wang Yu, Li Yu, Zhang Yu
in the days after.

290
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
I don't want to lose you to someone else,

291
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
so I just took the chance.

292
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
Do you know how much efforts I made

293
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,800
to make up that chance?

294
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
It not only used up my money,

295
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,280
but also took me plenty of time.

296
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
The Ms. Wang next door sent someone
to check out the house, didn't she?

297
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,080
All you need to do is just cleaning it up.

298
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,440
One yuan of management fee for one square meter

299
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
won't use up your money.

300
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,120
Am I that harsh to you?

301
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Then we're even now.

302
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,760
So you drove me back

303
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,400
and wanted to destroy me spiritually 
like this?

304
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,880
I wanted to wash your soul

305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
with all these little cuties.

306
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
I think that's pretty much it.

307
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,520
Could you get me things back?

308
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,880
Not now!

309
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
Before that,

310
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,560
you must do one thing.

311
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,360
On the furnishing temperament and taste of a CEO
from a game company. Mew!

312
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Mr. Xia!

313
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,760
This is a bit too cute!

314
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,360
What a surprise from Mr. Xia!

315
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
Satisfied now?

316
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
As a person who never

317
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,360
sends any post on WeChat moment,

318
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,240
you attract a lot of response with your first one.

319
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
All because of you!

320
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,920
You should be grateful
that I brought your feet onto the ground

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
so that you can feel the pulse of the masses.

322
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,480
I don't care about what the masses think.

323
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,440
Where on earth did you put my stuff?

324
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,800
In the guest room.

325
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,160
Oh, why is the guest room empty now?

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,280
It's always been empty.

327
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,040
Have you never had any guest?

328
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,240
Oh right,

329
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
how is the arrangement for the assessment team?

330
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,320
It's all set.

331
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,040
They are sending 3 persons.

332
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
We spare the first meeting room for them

333
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
as an office during this period.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
And the second meeting room for the team lead.

335
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,760
Zhang Sirui comes directly from the United States?

336
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah! I discussed with Mr. Wang and Amy.

337
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm going to borrow your car on that day

338
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,600
to pick her up.

339
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,560
You?

340
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
It's said that she hasn't come back
for a number of years

341
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,800
and can't get used to a lot of things.

342
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
She seems to be roughly the age as me.

343
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,080
I think I might help her better

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
as a contemporary.

345
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,360
That's right!

346
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,400
You reminded me of something.

347
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,160
I need to buy the stuff she might need

348
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,640
and put them in the office.

349
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,480
See you later.

350
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,320
Thief!

351
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Stop the thief!

352
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,640
Freeze!

353
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,360
Stay put!

354
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,360
Let me go!

355
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,720
Freeze!

356
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,280
On your feet!

357
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,880
Excuse me, miss!

358
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
Have you ever learned martial art?

359
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,720
That's not martial art.

360
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
It must be western fencing.

361
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,400
Stay put.

362
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's go!

363
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,560
Go!

364
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,640
Thank you so much!

365
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
You're amazing!

366
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,240
I've put my passport and a lot of valuable stuff

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
in this bag.

368
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
If I lose it,

369
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,520
god knows how worried I will be.

370
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,760
Thanks to you!

371
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
Can I follow you on WeChat?

372
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,520
I must thank you with something.

373
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,320
How about a dinner?

374
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,960
It's nothing but a lift of the finger.

375
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,120
Eh, she is a foreigner.

376
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Are you her driver?

377
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,800
Could you translate for me?

378
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,720
Or could you give her contact to me?

379
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,440
Sorry, I can't understand her either.

380
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,600
How about your contact?

381
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,440
Sorry!

382
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,400
Let's have dinner.

383
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,720
It was so cool

384
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,320
when you refused to speak to that guy.

385
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,680
He was totally muted

386
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,480
by your murmuring.

387
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
That was Portuguese.

388
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,920
Really? So you also speak Portuguese?

389
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,840
You're so amazing!

390
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,440
Are you also proficient at martial art?

391
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,160
Fencing!

392
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
What are the odds!

393
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,200
I have a friend who also fences.

394
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,680
So you're a driver?

395
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,360
First, you need to let her know

396
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
your distinctive position and role

397
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
so that she can see how much we care about her.

398
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
I forgot to introduce myself.

399
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm Xing Yun.

400
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm in charge of the newest Instance Zones in TIG.

401
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,240
I'm also the first employee of TIG.

402
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,560
First employee?

403
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,840
You must have a good relationship with Xia Ke then?

404
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,440
When she asks about Mr. Xia,

405
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,160
only pick the good words

406
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,120
to show your loyalty to him

407
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,400
and the unitedness of TIG.

408
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,560
Yeah, I know him better than anyone else.

409
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,480
You can ask me whatever you want to know about him.

410
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,040
Is Xia Ke single?

411
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,480
It's quite normal if you don't know.

412
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,480
He should not be a person

413
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,160
who wants to share his personal information with others.

414
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
No,

415
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,560
I think this question is a bit too private.

416
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,960
Is that related to investment?

417
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,760
If he has girlfriend or family,

418
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,240
then he has distractions,

419
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,440
weaknesses and a whole lot of uncertainties.

420
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
Mr. Xia is still single.

421
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,000
He's fully devoted to TIG right now.

422
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,520
Oh really!

423
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,960
Your evasion today is pointless.

424
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,080
He didn't come for the pickup.

425
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
So you haven't met him yet?

426
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,600
All the information about him

427
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,520
in recent year is here.

428
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,280
However, due to the tight schedule,

429
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,480
I didn't get much information about him personally.

430
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Xia Ke is pretty competent.

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,840
He started everything with barehand

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,240
and achieved such great height.

433
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,600
Hello!

434
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,720
Hello!

435
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
You were inquiring about

436
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,360
terminating the tenancy, right?

437
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,000
Here is a very good piece of news for you.

438
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Someone is willing to take over the tenancy.

439
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,760
You can take your cash pledge back.

440
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,600
Really?

441
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,520
Do I need to move everything out immediately?

442
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,680
No!

443
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,520
He wants to keep all the furniture

444
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
in your house

445
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,960
and will give you an extra sum of money
as the settlement allowance.

446
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,320
However much you paid for decoration,

447
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,600
he will make it up to you.

448
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
Let me think about it.

449
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Why are you here?

450
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,120
The water supply is off in my house.

451
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,480
Does that happen to such high-end apartment?

452
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,840
The tenancy here hasn't expired yet.

453
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
It's vacant anyway.

454
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,640
Alright! You could stay for a few more days.

455
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,560
Anyway, it'll be taken over by someone else
after a few days.

456
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Actually, you could move in with me.

457
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,000
I mean it's so inconvenient for you

458
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,880
to live with you parents every day.

459
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,120
Not at all.

460
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,640
My mom prepares all the meals and cleans the house.

461
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,040
What's inconvenient about that?

462
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,280
My life will be a mess without her.

463
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,840
Foreigners become independent at 18.

464
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,560
When do you plan

465
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
to be independent of your parents.

466
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,720
That makes sense.

467
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,640
Really?

468
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
Then spare your guest room for me.

469
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,600
It is vacant anyway.

470
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,800
I'll take it as your repayment to the rent.

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,360
No!

472
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Why not?

473
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
I like keeping the guest room vacant.

474
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,320
Why are you so contradictory?!

475
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,520
You want me to move in
but you don't give me any room.

476
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,080
I don't care!

477
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
If you want me to move in,

478
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,760
I must re-arrange the room layout.

479
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,240
I can't leave my prototypes, posters.

480
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,120
and all the colorful collections.

481
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,600
I move in, they move in.

482
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
That's not possible.

483
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,600
You!

484
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,000
Hello, dad!

485
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,120
Sweetie, why don't you come back?

486
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
Where are you right now?

487
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,080
I'm...outside.

488
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,520
I seemed to hear your voice just now.

489
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,000
in the corridor.

490
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Dad, you must have made a mistake.

491
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,240
Are you with your boss again?

492
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,880
No! Don't worry about me.

493
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Nobody in!

494
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,760
Mr. Xing, what are you doing there?

495
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,560
Come on in!

496
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,160
Xing Yun, it's time

497
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,160
for you to come back.

498
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
How ridiculous!

499
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,680
Sure!

500
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,320
When do you plan to

501
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
make our relationship public?

502
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,720
At least after the investment rolls out.

503
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,960
Did everything go fine today?

504
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,960
I figured out

505
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,920
why Mr. Qin appreciates Miss Zhang so much.

506
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,320
She is not only beautiful,

507
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,440
but also can speak fluent Portuguese.

508
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,160
She conquered a thief

509
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,280
in front of me today.

510
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
She was calm and brave.
Not even a single strand of hair was disturbed.

511
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,680
She was so cool.

512
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,080
So you are finally conquered by the one

513
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,160
who you wanted to conquer in the first place, aren't you?

514
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,040
It seems

515
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,920
I really didn't leave any good impression on her.

516
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,520
TIG wins the investment

517
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
with its actual strength.

518
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,640
Don't think too much.

519
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,320
Amy and Yiyi said

520
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,360
such type of assessment

521
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,400
is decided by the subjective consciousness
of the assessment team,

522
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,760
so I have to leave a good impression on her.

523
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,080
Enough talk.

524
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,840
I've gotta go now,

525
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,400
or else my dad will really wait outside your door.

526
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,120
See you!

527
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,120
Good morning, Miss Zhang!

528
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,800
This way please, Miss Zhang!

529
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
So that's the Miss Zhang!

530
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,840
Isn't she very beautiful and elegant?

531
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,080
True!

532
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,160
She gives out the signal that

533
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
no approaching for earthlings from head to toe.

534
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
Sir, here comes Miss Zhang.

535
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,800
Where is this beauty from?

536
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,200
She takes my soul away.

537
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,880
Xing Yun, how did you get to know her?

538
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
She is not from assessment team, is she?

539
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,120
I need her contact details.

540
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
What an idiot you are!

541
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
Don't you see her in Mr. Xia's arms?

542
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,600
She's from the US.

543
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
That's just an expression of politeness, OK?!

544
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
Long time no see, Xia Ke!

545
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
It is you!

546
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
Fate is a tricky thing.

547
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,480
Mr. Qin transferred me back particularly

548
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,320
for a case that holds great promise.

549
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,680
I found your name

550
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,120
after I reviewed the file.

551
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,320
It's such a surprise that

552
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,920
you're the boss of a game company now.

553
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,720
Zhang Sirui!

554
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,920
Excuse me!

555
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,120
I'll leave you alone.

556
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,000
Why do you change your name, Zhang Rui?

557
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
After breaking up with you.

558
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,720
Don't you laugh at me.

559
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
I've been single all these years

560
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,280
and forced to go to the fortune teller.

561
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,040
I was told that I couldn't find my true love

562
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,200
because of the name.

563
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,520
So I changed it.

564
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,320
You know what?

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,880
I would never learn the way

566
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,160
she looked at Mr. Xia just now.

567
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,120
How was it like?

568
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,040
It feels like

569
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,560
she has a hundred stories in her eyes

570
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,880
and a load of words in her heart.

571
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,760
But she just shows a small tip of it

572
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,480
with a little bit of solitude.

573
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,080
It makes you want to hold her in your arms in no time.

574
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Leave these dog food, will you?

575
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,880
I think you should think of a complete plan

576
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,600
to protect your boyfriend.

577
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,480
What does it have to do with skin protections?

578
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Boyfriend!

579
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
I think someone else should be appointed
as the assessment team lead.

580
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,680
We are old friends.

581
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,800
The assessment result will lose impartiality.

582
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,040
I said the same to Mr. Qin before,

583
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,080
but he thinks old friends can assess
each other much better

584
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
which is already the best arrangement.

585
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,520
Don't worry. I'll help you for sure!

586
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,560
Mr. Wang, come here please.

587
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,520
Mr. Wang will come soon.

588
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,200
He will take charge of all the things
about the assessment.

589
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
Do you hate to talk to me this much?!

590
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Or you are still mad at me

591
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,840
at present?

592
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,960
No!

593
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,680
I heard you're still single.

594
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,560
No, the one who picked you up yesterday

595
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
is my girlfriend, Xing Yun.

596
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,160
Mr. Wang!

597
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,240
Mr. Xia.

598
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,320
This is the lead of the assessment team,

599
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,320
Miss Zhang!

600
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Nice to meet you, Miss Zhang!

601
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
We have prepared the makeshift office

602
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,440
a long time ago.

603
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,600
Please come with me.

604
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,600
I think Mr. Xia can make full use of his handsomeness

605
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,800
whenever necessary.

606
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Perhaps a handsome smile

607
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,600
can increase the investment by ten millions.

608
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,080
I believe he has such charisma.

609
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
Are you kidding?

610
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,720
What if you lose Mr. Xia

611
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,880
even if you help TIG to win the capital?!

612
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,960
No, I trust him.

613
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,520
Miss Zhang!

614
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,840
Miss Zhang!

615
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,600
This is Amy.

616
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Mr. Xia knows

617
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,240
you're away from China for many years.

618
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
He appoints his personal assistant, Amy,

619
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,240
to help you get familiar with the place.

620
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,640
This girl is the one
who picked me up yesterday, right?

621
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,520
I enjoy talking to her.

622
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,520
Can you let her to do it instead?

623
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,440
Er...

624
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,960
Xing Yun is in charge of very important work

625
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,720
in TIG right now.

626
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,280
Yes, I can.

627
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,920
It's better to seek Mr. Xia's consent.

628
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,720
Not needed.

629
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,040
Helping the assessment team

630
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
to know TIG business

631
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,240
and make decision on the investment is top priority,

632
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,720
but I have limited capability.

633
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,800
I only can do something easy,

634
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,040
but not professional things...

635
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,760
There is nothing professional involved.

636
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,080
I just need a favor from you.

637
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,240
I really can't understand.

638
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
That's just a temporary office.

639
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,720
Why does she want to buy new cushion, table lamp,

640
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,720
laptop, cup and everything else?

641
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
And yet she is so picky on them.

642
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,920
That's her pursuit on life quality,

643
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,720
but her taste is very similar to Mr. Xia's.

644
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Now I understand

645
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,680
why she requires you to help her.

646
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,720
She has the same taste as Mr. Xia.

647
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,800
She has just come here

648
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,920
without any friends.

649
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,400
It's totally normal to ask me for a favor.

650
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,400
What's wrong with that?!

651
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Are you and Amy habitually hostile

652
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,120
to beauties?

653
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,560
It's almost done.

654
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,680
I've got a meeting in a while.

655
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,680
I have one more item left.

656
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,600
I'll be back after I get that.

657
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,720
Sure, see you later then.

658
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm taking these back for you.

659
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,040
Bye!

660
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
So you need me

661
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
to deliver just one afternoon tea

662
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
for Xia Ke's company from today on?

663
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,080
I'm just confirming with you on this.

664
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,520
Not sure if you have the time.

665
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,160
Of course I can.

666
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,320
Why not

667
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
if this can help Xia Ke get the investment.

668
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,480
Are you serious?

669
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,760
That's so great.

670
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,080
The assessment lady only eats Black Forest,

671
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,360
either in form of cupcake or slices.

672
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,240
That's not a problem.

673
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
I happen to have clients for afternoon tea.

674
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,400
I'll spare one portion for you.

675
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,800
Thank you, Shen Qing!

676
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,720
By the way,

677
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,720
do you know the tea set brand, Fortnum Mason,

678
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,480
for afternoon tea?

679
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,520
Where is that available?

680
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,840
So she requires designated tea set?

681
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,720
She wants the tea of that brand.

682
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,320
The so-called Royal Blend.

683
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,720
They are pretty hard to attain.

684
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,320
But you could lend the set from Xia Ke

685
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,240
to her.

686
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,720
If I don't remember it wrong,

687
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,360
Xia Ke has a set of that,

688
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,320
except that he doesn't use it much.

689
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Xia Ke's?

690
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,720
Fortnum Mason is an old shop in London

691
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,240
with a history of over 300 years.

692
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
The afternoon tea there is very famous.

693
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,040
Xia Ke went there a lot when he studied there.

694
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,720
As for the Royal Blend,

695
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,920
Xia Ke might have it very rarely.

696
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,840
He should have some stock of it.

697
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
But I'm a bit curious

698
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,920
about the background of this assessment lady.

699
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
Mr. He, Xing Yun is not available now.

700
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,160
I'll meet Xia Ke then.

701
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,480
We haven't got the investment yet,

702
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,880
so I guess you're here not for company business.

703
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Give me your phone!

704
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,480
(Yao Qing. Location: Scotland)

705
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,720
When was that?

706
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,480
I don't know. It's already like that
when I realized.

707
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,400
Same like me.

708
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,920
What?

709
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Staying together for too long

710
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,600
makes it difficult to notice

711
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,160
if there is no external driving force

712
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
or changes of the daily mode.

713
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,880
You and Yao Qing

714
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,280
are my important friends.

715
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
You must show your sincerity for 100%.

716
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,920
Stop lessoning on me.

717
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm a lot more worried about her than you.

718
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Forward the picture with a hotel to me

719
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,920
from her WeChat moment.

720
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
Hello, I'd like to book a plane ticket.

721
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,000
Hey, what's up?

722
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,640
Miss Zhang sent an email of requests

723
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
for a load of material suddenly,

724
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
and she requested you to be the contact

725
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
to beautify the reports.

726
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,720
Now we are all prepared

727
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,280
to work overnight for it.

728
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Beibei, send me that email again!

729
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
-The last one is not good. -OK

730
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
I heard you have the tea set and tea leaf

731
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,240
of the brand, Fortnum Mason.

732
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,920
Why do you need them?

733
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,400
Miss Zhang wants them to have afternoon tea.

734
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,640
You should offer them up!

735
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,120
I don't have them.

736
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,200
But Shen Qing told me you have.

737
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,680
She's bluffingâ€¦

738
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,400
Thanks to everyone!

739
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,960
Since we asked for speedup all of a sudden,

740
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,320
you had to work overtime till now.

741
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,440
So I bought some sushi for you.

742
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,240
Thanks for your hard work.

743
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,600
Let's enjoy it!

744
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,760
The sushi from this restaurant

745
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,960
have very similar taste

746
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
with the ones from the restaurant nearby our school.

747
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,440
Miss Zhang, are you alumni?

748
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,800
Which school are you from?

749
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,520
Why do you have so many beauties and handsome boys?

750
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,880
You must have a lot of stories

751
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,920
to tell from your school.

752
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,480
Why don't you tell us a few

753
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,720
so we can enjoy the sushi better?

754
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,720
The boss is here!

755
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,720
Stop gossiping.

756
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,280
Go with your food!

757
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,600
Come on!

758
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,920
Stop talking!

759
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,440
Maggie!

760
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,760
Xia Ke didn't have good sleep.

761
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
He could only fall asleep away from the apartment,

762
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,640
so he was often seen in places like

763
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,280
library, classroom, and bench.

764
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,920
I also bring you some supplements

765
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,880
that can help you sleep better.

766
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,040
That's not necessary.

767
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,440
My girlfriend

768
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
prepared a good bed for me.

769
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
If I can't sleep well,

770
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,360
I'll go to her place.

771
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,680
Mr. Xia, you have girlfriend already?

772
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
That's breaking news.

773
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,160
When was that, Mr. Xia?

774
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,320
Some time ago.

775
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,800
Who is she? Do we know her?

776
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,680
Does everybody know her?

777
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,160
Perhaps no.

778
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,760
Perhaps yes.

779
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,880
My girlfriend

780
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,800
will come to the company and meet everyone

781
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,720
after the investment capital

782
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,080
is finally settled.

783
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
Then it's totally dependent on Miss Zhang now.

784
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
I'm really curious about how she looks like.

785
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,480
What type is she?

786
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,120
She is a...

787
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,600
What's that sound?!

788
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
Something exploded.

789
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,320
I'll go get the broom.

790
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,320
Are you alright?

791
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
That was just an accident.

792
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,920
I just feel a bit jealous inside.

793
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,880
Do you still remember
that you said magnanimously that

794
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,960
you want Mr. Xia to exchange the investment
with his handsomeness?

795
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Now you are daunted by a simple hug.

796
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,600
Come on! Let's take up the weapon
and go back to the battlefield.

797
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,120
Mr. Xia is so excellent.

798
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,280
Fighting against girls of different walks of life

799
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,520
would possibly be common for you.

800
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,320
Let's go!

801
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,680
Clean this up!

802
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,320
The takeaway is spoiled.

803
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,560
I'll get something else for you.

804
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,000
Thank you, boss!

805
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,280
Thank you, boss!

806
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,080
Let's go!

807
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,280
I'll come with you.

808
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,800
No, thank you!

809
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,920
Xia Ke!

810
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,080
Xia Ke!

811
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,040
Sorry, Miss Zhang!

812
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,400
Sorry!

813
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,080
Xia Ke!

814
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,240
You never told me she is your alumnus.

815
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,400
Are you jealous?

816
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,920
No, I'm not.

817
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,480
I don't know what happened just now.

818
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,880
She jumped into my arms in the dark.

819
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,880
It was just like that when the lights were on.

820
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,560
I know that

821
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,440
a lot of girls have shown affection to you

822
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,320
and you never allow them to approach,

823
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,600
but that was just too close.

824
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,600
Just now...

825
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,840
You'd better call her back.

826
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,680
No!

827
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,560
Tell me

828
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,280
how can I make you happy?

829
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,640
How can I make it up?

830
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,640
An eye for an eye.

831
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,640
At least, I need to hug a man

832
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,720
in front of you.

833
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,320
Let me think.

834
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,440
Will it be Ronald McDonald

835
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
or Colonel Sanders?

836
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,720
Speaking of food, I'm really hungry.

837
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,720
Shall we go for a midnight snack?

838
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,080
I know a good place.

839
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:15,880
Let's go!

840
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Thanks for coming.

841
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,040
Auntie Huang!

842
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,000
Xing Yun!

843
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,040
You come alone?

844
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,760
Sir, how many persons?

845
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
Auntie, he comes with me.

846
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,400
You both are together.

847
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,320
Sorry for my mistake.

848
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,600
Look at you!

849
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,040
What a pair! Take your seats!

850
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Come on! Take your seats.

851
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,720
We'll take away.

852
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,000
Who is this guy?

853
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,680
Is he a star? He's so handsome.

854
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,480
He's my boss.

855
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,360
Xing Yun has told you

856
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,240
you're ordering overtime meal for 12 persons.

857
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,760
Please remain seated.
You'll surely be satisfied.

858
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,920
The best food of a restaurant

859
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,760
won't be there on the menu.

860
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,920
Unlocking the hidden menu is not a technique

861
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,360
only for rich people.

862
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,160
Do you feel attracted by me now?

863
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,240
Kind of!

864
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,120
Only kind of?

865
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,520
Have some food. The takeaway is being made.

866
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,440
Help yourselves.

867
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,400
Thank you, uncle Huang.

868
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,080
Try uncle Huang's cuisine.

869
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,600
My mom and dad come here every week

870
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,600
for more than 10 years.

871
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,400
Yeah!

872
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,600
Her mom and I were colleagues

873
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,760
of great relation.

874
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,600
I watched her growing up.

875
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,680
Before we started this restaurant,

876
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,880
this girl

877
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,840
loved the Dapanji and braised noodles

878
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,520
by him.

879
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,840
She doesn't take spicy food.

880
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,880
Try this frozen crayfish.

881
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,440
You'll love its original taste.

882
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,320
Yeah!

883
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,840
Help yourselves!

884
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,480
Enjoy it!

885
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,120
Thank you, uncle and auntie Huang!

886
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,240
My god!

887
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,440
Is this the same hand which made the cakes?

888
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,320
There are skills behind this.

889
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,040
Come on! Let me teach you.

890
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,040
See! Do it like this.

891
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,720
Wait a second.

892
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,000
Knuckle the crevice at its head.

893
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,400
Then pull your right hand gently.

894
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Clean it up for me!

895
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Is it clean now?

896
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,920
Yeah!

897
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,320
How annoying you are!

898
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:06,960
What are you looking at?

899
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
I think this place

900
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,600
should be the NO. 1 place for dating.

901
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,920
Is this romantic to your standard?

902
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,560
Come on! You have a long way to go.

903
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Not for you!
