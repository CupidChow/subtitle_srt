=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,580
=Episode 12=

3
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,860
What's up?

4
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,980
My car can't be used today due to
the traffic restrictions. I want to borrow yours.

5
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
No. I have an appointment.

6
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,620
I know

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,060
you've made an appointment with Peter from TIG

8
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,500
to inspect the site. He is very boring.

9
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,820
I don't think so.

10
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,500
Peter is very rigorous

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,060
and does things in a down-to-earth way.

12
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,660
So, invite him to the company.

13
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,180
Chat with him over coffee.

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,580
Such a sticky business

15
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,340
should be done by me.

16
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,300
No, no! Hold on!

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,900
You are going out for business for me

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,140
but I think you have another purpose.

19
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,940
You'd keep to yourself.

20
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,300
You went to the Sword Fighting Gym
to get close to him.

21
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,420
How can you bear to see me suffer?

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,900
This shopping mall mainly composes of

23
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
medium-and high-end brands and niche brands.

24
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,180
70% of them are women's products.

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,180
Downstairs is an supermarket to sell imported goods.

26
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,780
On the two floors above are catering businesses.

27
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,100
Some netizens' favorite restaurants are among them.

28
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,220
Within a distance of three kilometers from it
are all office buildings.

29
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,340
We can say the number of the customers here
on weekdays

30
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,980
is higher than on weekends.

31
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,700
So, the targeted customers of this shopping mall

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,660
are the white-collar women working nearby.

33
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,780
You are so smart.

34
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,980
These women aged between 24

35
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,060
and 35

36
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,420
with moderate or above consuming ability

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,220
are the main potential customers of

38
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,580
our Infinite Unknown Love.

39
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
So, it will be a pretty good choice

40
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,420
if we hold an off-line activity here.

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,580
You've come to talk about this matter

42
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,500
with me?

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,300
If not,

44
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,140
what do you think we'll talk about?

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,900
Or what're you looking forward to?

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,500
But it's not within my duty at all.

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,740
It's useless talking with me about it.

48
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,380
I'm leaving now.

49
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,980
What?

50
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,180
I need you.

51
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,540
Based on the design style of this shopping mall,

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,460
you can provide me a field data

53
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,780
which suits the site most.

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,020
Besides,

55
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,500
you are good at fine arts

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,900
and you are the planner of the game instance.

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,180
Your opinion is most valuable.

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,140
Of course,

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,820
I'll take the opportunity to have dinner with you.

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,260
What shall we eat?

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,820
How about Spanish food?

62
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,500
I just want to treat you to a dinner.

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,420
It's not a big deal.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,780
What's the big deal?

65
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,340
I am not as idle as you.

66
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,460
The second round of closed Beta test will start.

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,380
You see,

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,540
as a mature professional,

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,460
you should learn how to relax.

70
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,980
You'd learn to live a happy life

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,020
even under a lot of pressure.

72
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,340
Learn to survive

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,300
the hardships.

74
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,660
Let's make a bet.

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,620
If I win, you'll have dinner with me.

76
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
If I lose, I'll give you a ride to the company.

77
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,740
Okay?

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,100
What's the bet?

79
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,260
Let's guess

80
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,700
what that woman's occupation is.

81
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,500
I don't know.

82
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,460
She's wearing glasses. A teacher?

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,460
I guess she is a financial worker.

84
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,060
Miss Liu, what did you buy?

85
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,580
Let's go.

86
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,660
Why did you know that?

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,940
When I observed her trying on the shoes just now,

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,060
she put every pair of shoes she tried on in place.

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,780
It showed she had OCD.

90
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,980
This store will refund 30 yuan
if the customer consumes 300 yuan or above.

91
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,660
The VIP of the mall can enjoy a 15% discount.

92
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,060
If you pay online, you can enjoy more discounts.

93
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,860
Just now I saw her pressing the calculator

94
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,100
very skillfully.

95
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,180
So, she must use a computer frequently in her life.

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,420
Besides, she didn't put the shopping receipts

97
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,500
in her bag casually.

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Instead, she put them in her wallet very neatly.

99
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,260
It shows that she has the occupational disease of

100
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,500
putting her receipts neatly.

101
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,420
Are you admiring me?

102
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,060
Actually I meant

103
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,940
I am a good judge of character.

104
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,700
Since we worked together,

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,780
you've really been a

106
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,700
responsible

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,100
and promising game planner

108
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,020
according to your job performance.

109
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,660
I mean it.

110
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,620
The game instance is bound to make a hit.

111
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,500
So, where shall we eat?

112
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,900
I doubt it

113
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,460
you know that woman.

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm not trustworthy?

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,900
Of course you are.

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,900
So, let's change a target.

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,940
That guy. That…

118
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,180
Shen Qing's ex-husband?

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,060
Our acquaintance.

120
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,220
He wants to buy something for Shen Qing
in the jewelry store,

121
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,980
doesn't he?

122
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,780
We'd better not make a crazy guess.

123
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,460
Let's go.

124
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,820
I have ever bought a diamond ring in the store.

125
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,860
Can you tell me whether your store
has a ring of this kind?

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
Sir, you are lucky.

127
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,340
We've stopped producing this kind of rings.

128
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,020
But our store has this kind of rings in stock.

129
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,860
Wait a minute, please.

130
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,460
Thank you.

131
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,220
You're welcome.

132
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,300
He wants to move his ex-wife in this way. Shame on him!

133
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,260
What can I do for you?

134
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,540
Lovers' rings.

135
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,180
Okay.

136
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,140
Shen Qing, I'll pick you up later.

137
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,420
I'll take you to a place.

138
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,660
See you later.

139
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,140
Okay.

140
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
He made an appointment with Shen Qing
and prepared a ring.

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,140
Is he going to make a proposal?

142
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,300
I have no idea.

143
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,060
This is the ring you want. Please keep it.

144
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,380
Thank you.

145
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,660
You're welcome. Take care!

146
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,820
What are you doing? Be serious, okay?

147
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,300
My girlfriend has only one shortcoming.

148
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,540
She is too picky.

149
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,380
Why do we come here?

150
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,740
Having been away from here for too long,
I always think of here.

151
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,980
At the time this restaurant's food
was our favorite.

152
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,580
Do you remember it?

153
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,540
The boss of the restaurant has
the same family name-Shen as you.

154
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,460
You might be disappointed.

155
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,820
This restaurant has been closed for a long time.

156
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,140
Miss Shen!

157
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,100
Mr. Shen!

158
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,780
Long time no see!

159
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,980
What brought you here?

160
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,620
Has the restaurant been…?

161
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,700
Yes, yes.

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,380
I closed it last year.

163
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,740
Then I went back to my hometown
to enjoy my remaining years.

164
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,420
Before long, Mr. Ling came to my hometown
to see me

165
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,940
by driving a car.

166
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,780
He wanted me to come back

167
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,220
to cook a big dinner for you.

168
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,180
He said it's in my small restaurant that

169
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,100
he made a proposal to you.

170
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,180
He misses here very much.

171
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,140
What a sweet couple you are! Good!

172
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,540
Okay. Sir, let's come in.

173
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
Yes, yes.

174
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,380
Please come in.

175
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,940
Who do you want to see?

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,500
We come here for dinner.

177
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,180
Our restaurant has been closed for a long time.

178
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,980
It's not open for business now.

179
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,900
But I saw somebody come in.

180
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,260
That's our boss' friend.

181
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm sorry. Please leave here.

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,020
What should we do?

183
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,820
What should we do?

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,660
Everything here hasn't changed at all.

185
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Mr. Ling asked me to recover

186
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,060
its original look.

187
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,300
Mr. Shen,

188
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,300
if I didn't see your current appearance,

189
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,940
I would really think we've gone back to the past.

190
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,820
Really?

191
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,580
You are interesting.

192
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,460
I’ll leave you to talk.

193
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,300
The dinner has been prepared.

194
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,020
Okay.

195
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,540
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

196
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,060
You're welcome.

197
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,860
Have you heard that person say

198
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,500
Ling Shan made a proposal to Shen Qing

199
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,740
that year?

200
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,500
What he did really surprised me.

201
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,060
I'm afraid it's hard for any woman

202
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,300
to resist his tricks.

203
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,460
What should we do? She won't agree, will she?

204
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,620
Xia Ke is my brother.

205
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,780
That jerk wants to date my brother's elder sister again.

206
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,980
I'll surely figure it out.

207
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,700
Aren't you facing a daunting task?

208
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,660
Why are you still here

209
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,940
to care about the privacy of your boss?

210
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Who says I am caring about Mr. Xia?

211
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm concerned about Chu Nan.

212
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
He's also my friend.

213
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,780
Besides,

214
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,260
he and Shen Qing love each other.

215
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,140
Chu Nan? Your ex-boyfriend?

216
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,500
To be frank,

217
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,460
compared with the relationship
between you and your ex-boyfriend,

218
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,700
I feel humble.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,060
So, why not call him

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,220
to inform him now?

221
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,420
Once the ring is worn around her finger,

222
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,540
it'll be too late.

223
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,020
Yes.

224
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,940
Where are you going?

225
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,700
I am trying to get in.

226
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,420
Chu Nan, the ex-husband of Shen Qing

227
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,540
intends to make a proposal to her.

228
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,700
If you don't want to regret it,

229
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,060
hurry here.

230
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,560
(Reply at once)

231
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,740
Hello, Mr. Xia!

232
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,540
Can you come to the Jinhu Road?

233
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,140
I am busy now.

234
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,980
Shen Qing and Ling Shan are here.

235
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,100
Let me drop you a pin.

236
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,350
How did you know Ling Shan?

237
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,340
Anyway,

238
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,780
they might marry each other again.

239
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,620
Will you come here?

240
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,220
How did you get the ladder?

241
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,100
I have great magic power.

242
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,060
I can get whatever I want.

243
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,980
I know

244
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,300
you can't have done such a thing.

245
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,180
But don't worry.

246
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,020
When I was a child, I often played truant
by climbing the wall.

247
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,340
So?

248
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,660
So, I'll jump first.

249
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,820
Let me protect you at the foot of the wall.

250
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,700
You can jump in my arms.

251
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,660
He. When I jump, you'd catch me.

252
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,980
Don't worry! I'll catch you.

253
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,340
He He! You are amazing!

254
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,100
What a nerve!

255
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,100
You…you don't enter it?

256
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,460
You enter it and then open the door for me.

257
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,140
You…you'd hold the ladder for me at least.

258
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,420
Help yourselves, please!

259
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:35,980
Thank you.

260
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
I haven't tasted such a flavor

261
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,380
for a long time.

262
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,340
I'm able to find the flavor you used to like

263
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,540
and I can also find the most beautiful memories
we have shared.

264
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,660
Have a taste!

265
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,620
Help yourself! I've eaten too much.

266
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,820
It's okay. Help yourself!

267
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,700
Shen Qing!

268
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,260
I can't treat you to a big dinner
in a luxury restaurant.

269
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,940
I just treat you to such home-cooking dishes.

270
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,260
Will you dislike them?

271
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,500
I like it here very much.

272
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,060
You know, I've eaten the delicacies
from land to sea.

273
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,940
Few people cook such food for me.

274
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,540
It's similar to the food my mother cooks.

275
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,860
I hope to be with you forever.

276
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,260
Although we can only eat such simple food now,

277
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,340
I promise

278
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,860
I'll give you the feeling of a warm home

279
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,340
forever.

280
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,460
Shen Qing, please marry me!

281
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,180
Shen Qing,

282
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,740
forgive me for leaving you.

283
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,180
But from today on,

284
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
I'll give all my life to you

285
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,300
and give you and Xiaoxi a happy home.

286
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,580
Let's marry each other again.

287
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,780
Shen Qing, don't say yes to him.

288
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Xing Yun! He Yu!

289
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,460
Long time no see, Shen Qing!

290
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
You…

291
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,740
You…

292
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:16,940
Are we a good match?

293
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,300
Yes. My taste is also changing.

294
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,980
There are thousands of flavors out there.

295
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,700
Why should I always bear the former favor in mind?

296
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,580
Am I right, Shen Qing?

297
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Shen Qing, anyway,

298
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,700
let's stop to wait for Xia Ke to come here, okay?

299
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,340
There are so many things you don't know at all.

300
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
What things?

301
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,340
I…I can't tell you.

302
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,140
We have to wait for Xia Ke

303
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,860
to tell you about the matter.

304
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,540
Believe me. He is on the way here.

305
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,060
Shen Qing, will you bear to let your brother

306
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,740
separate us again?

307
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,060
Shen Qing, Xia Ke has never done anything wrong

308
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,020
to you.

309
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,300
But for him, we wouldn't have divorced.

310
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,180
And Shen Xiaoxi wouldn't have grown up

311
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,540
in a family without his father.

312
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,260
It's enough!

313
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,980
Ling Shan, I'm sorry

314
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,380
I can't marry you.

315
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,380
Shen Qing,

316
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,580
do you really believe these outsiders?

317
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,660
Yes. I admit

318
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,420
what you did today

319
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,980
reminds me of our past.

320
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,180
But they are only memories.

321
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I have fallen in love with

322
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,540
another man.

323
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,980
Who? That Chu Nan?

324
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,780
You don't love him at all.

325
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,220
Yes, I do.

326
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,940
Yes. I used to see him

327
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,980
as my asylum.

328
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,580
When I had no way out,

329
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,860
I would turn to him.

330
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,740
But when I recover myself,

331
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,420
my self-esteem will become

332
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,660
my most powerful weapon.

333
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,740
I hurt him and pushed him away

334
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,300
with various bitter words.

335
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,700
Actually I know

336
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,380
he is the man who saved me.

337
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,860
Without him, there is no today's Shen Qing.

338
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,100
Perhaps I won't abandon my pride,

339
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,020
but the innermost part of my heart

340
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,820
belongs to him.

341
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,540
Chu Nan?

342
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,620
You won't have to abandon your pride.

343
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,020
Seeing your ex-boyfriend find his true love,

344
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,820
how do you feel?

345
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,300
Do you need my shoulder to cry on?

346
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,700
No!

347
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
Don't pretend to be strong.
My chest muscle is very…

348
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,060
Take your hand away.

349
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,220
Mr. Xia.

350
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,180
Chu Nan.

351
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,500
Where is Ling Shan?

352
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,420
You've come late.

353
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,180
But everything is under my control.

354
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,940
He was here just now.

355
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,100
I don't know when he left.

356
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,620
I have something to tell you.

357
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,620
Go ahead.

358
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,180
Do you remember Hu Ranran

359
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,780
who used to work in the company?

360
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,500
You mean

361
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,420
the business assistant working for Ling Shan?

362
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,340
Yes.

363
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,660
Will they fight?

364
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,620
It's hard to predict since one is a volcano
and the other is a firecracker.

365
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,740
They won't.

366
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,780
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,020
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,540
Shen Qing,

369
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,460
I really want to protect you.

370
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,780
I should have made a self-introduction.

371
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm He Yu.

372
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
I'm Xia Ke's brother and classmate

373
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,140
as well as the wooer of Xing Yun.

374
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,940
I'm your successor.

375
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,020
Successor?

376
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,820
Yes.

377
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
If so,

378
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,980
you will be a loser.

379
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,500
Come and sit in my car. I'll give you a lift.

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,820
Mr. He.

381
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,460
She seems not to be an employee of Jiawo.

382
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,100
You knew the big secret of

383
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,540
your boss just now.

384
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,180
Be careful! He will kill you to keep the secret.

385
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,380
Okay. You can sit in his car.

386
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,540
But you will be recorded as absenteeism today.

387
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Mr. Xia, I came out with Mr. He

388
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
for the sake of my work.

389
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,980
But I looked through his Moments

390
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
and I don't think

391
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,900
you both came here for work.

392
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,820
You did something for yourselves.

393
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,220
(He Yu: For the first time,
I want to belong to someone)

394
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:52,860
You…

395
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,060
Mr. Xia, it's a mistake.

396
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,420
We stayed in the jewelry store

397
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,340
to spy on

398
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,540
Shen Qing and Ling Shan.

399
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,180
Delete it!

400
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,860
No!

401
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,740
Delete it!

402
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,500
No!

403
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,060
Delete it or not?

404
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,580
I won't.

405
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,700
-Give your phone to me. -No. No.

406
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,420
Give your phone to me.

407
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,860
No!

408
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,500
Give your phone to me!

409
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,700
Give it to me!

410
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,140
Hello!

411
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,140
Calm down! What's wrong with Xiaoxi?

412
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,140
Get in the car.

413
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,420
What's wrong?

414
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,300
Ling Shan took away Xiaoxi from the kindergarten.

415
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,940
Ah?

416
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,260
You…you…

417
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,540
Will we go to find my mom?

418
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,900
Mom said I couldn't go with you alone.

419
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,780
Have you forgotten it?

420
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,100
I'm asking you. where's my mom?

421
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,380
Where's my mom?

422
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:46,900
Shut up!

423
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,580
Sit up!

424
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,180
How careless I was!

425
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,060
I went to the kindergarten to pick up Xiaoxi

426
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,980
together with him.

427
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,460
So, the teachers all knew him.

428
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,220
He is Xiaoxi's biological father.

429
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,260
He shouldn't treat the kid badly.

430
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,260
(Xia Ke)

431
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,300
Hello, sister!

432
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,820
What car is Ling Shan driving?

433
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,660
A black one. Perhaps it's a Honda.

434
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,620
What's its plate number?

435
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,500
I don't know. The last figure might be one.

436
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,700
X51.

437
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,700
Yes. X51.

438
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,700
Xia Ke, you must find Ling Shan.

439
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,140
He has a debt of more than 10 million yuan

440
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
and has a lot of loans.

441
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,100
He did so perhaps for money.

442
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,460
I gave Xiaoxi a watch

443
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,380
which has a locating device.

444
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,260
Did he wear it?

445
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,180
Yes, yes.

446
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,580
He wears it when he goes to school.

447
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,500
Okay. Please check his location and drop me a pin.

448
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,380
Okay.

449
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,500
Have you dropped a pin?

450
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,180
I've received it.

451
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,300
It's that one.

452
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,060
Please sit up.

453
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,380
Shen Qing?

454
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,700
I've seen Ling Shan's car.

455
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,420
Be careful.

456
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,940
Xia Ke, Xiaoxi is in the car.

457
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,060
We can't make a slip-up again.

458
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,020
Xia Ke, please save Xiaoxi!

459
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,820
Shen Qing, believe me.

460
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,620
If we continue to follow him,
we'll enter the mountains.

461
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,580
It'll be harder for us to catch up with him
on the winding mountain road.

462
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,820
Xiaoxi!

463
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
The kid is in the car.

464
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,100
Aren't you afraid of hurting him?

465
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,700
Mom! Mom!

466
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,700
Shen Qing, Shen Qing! I'm wrong. Please forgive me.

467
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,660
I shouldn't have believed that woman.

468
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,980
She hooked up with me

469
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,860
due to my being the son-in-law of the Xia family.

470
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,660
When she ran out of my money,
she ran away with another guy.

471
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,540
Later I got a loan from the bank.

472
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,700
I intended to do some business,

473
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,700
but I didn't expected
I was cheated out of my money.

474
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,340
I've come to a dead end, Shen Qing.

475
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,660
Where did you want to take him?

476
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,140
I'm his father.

477
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,860
I won't hurt him.

478
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,900
I wanted to exchange him for some money
from your grandma.

479
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,740
Shen Qing, I'm wrong.

480
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,340
I did it on impulse.

481
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,860
Forgive me for the sake of the fact
that we used to be a couple.

482
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,980
I am lucky for one thing.

483
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,580
It's that I gave him Shen instead of Ling
as his family name.

484
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,100
You can leave now.

485
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,300
I don't want to see you again.

486
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:12,980
Get out of here!

487
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,100
Shen Qing!

488
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,620
Do you know that?

489
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,140
She broke up with her parents

490
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,260
for the sake of you and Shen Xiaoxi.

491
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,220
Mrs. Xia won't be scared by your threat.

492
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,180
Mr. Xia, could you stop for a while?

493
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,300
I want to buy something.

494
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,580
Wait a minute.

495
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,140
Mr. Xia, your hand.

496
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,300
I see there is a park ahead.

497
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
How about parking the car over there?

498
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,340
Let's go there to deal with your wound.

499
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,460
Thank you.

500
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,540
Don't mention it.

501
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,860
Thank you for having stopped Shen Qing.

502
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,700
I didn't expect that you would try to

503
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,860
help Shen Qing and Chu Nan so much.

504
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,540
Can I think

505
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,500
you have walked out of

506
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,220
the shadow of your last relationship?

507
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,540
No shadow at all.

508
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,660
It's because I'm Chu Nan's ex-girlfriend

509
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,740
that I am more clear that

510
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,820
he and Shen Qing truly love each other.

511
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,740
I've figured out a thing recently.

512
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,140
Being lonely in the rest of my life is horrible,

513
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,900
but it's more than I can bear to

514
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,660
live with a man who makes me lonely

515
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,380
all my life.

516
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,420
So, I hope Shen Qing has found
her Mr. Right this time.

517
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,860
But I don't understand

518
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,980
why you keep the secret of Ling Shan having an affair

519
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,740
with another woman for many years

520
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,100
and would rather make Shen Qing get you wrong.

521
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,220
When he got to know Shen Qing,

522
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,500
she was seven years old.

523
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,780
They went to school together
and then studied abroad and graduated together.

524
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,820
They traveled and married.

525
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,260
It can be said that Ling Shan

526
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,540
took up my sister's whole youth.

527
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,580
I always think as long
as his or her first love is beautiful,

528
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,980
this person will have the longing for

529
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,500
love all his or her life.

530
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,580
So, I don't want to see

531
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,340
she loses the ability to love a man.

532
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,180
Besides, when Ling Shan broke up with her,

533
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,140
she had been pregnant with Xiaoxi.

534
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,660
She knew that grandma wouldn't allow her
to give birth to the baby.

535
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,460
So, she went abroad alone to give birth to Xiaoxi.

536
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,420
When she brought Xiaoxi back,

537
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,380
I couldn't bear to tell her the truth.

538
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,540
Actually I don't hope to see
she will think he has a jerk dad

539
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,660
at the sight of Xiaoxi.

540
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Do you know why I got so angry

541
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,340
when you concealed the matter about Chu Nan

542
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,820
from me?

543
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,260
Because compared with dating someone stupidly

544
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,820
while being kept in the dark,

545
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,180
I would rather know the truth.

546
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,340
Which will make Shen Qing more sad,

547
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,260
suffering from knowing

548
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,780
what the jerk is really like

549
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,540
or mistaking her dear brother

550
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,380
for so many years?

551
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,860
I didn't give it a thought.

552
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,500
Forget it. it happened many years ago.

553
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,620
I don't want to explain it.

554
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,900
But it's good to see

555
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,580
Shen Qing and Chu Nan become a sweet couple.

556
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,940
She won't get hurt anymore in future.

557
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,380
Are you okay?

558
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,060
Chu Nan called me just now.

559
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,260
I've found what you want.

560
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,220
Xiaoxi!

561
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,340
Please take Xiaoxi in.

562
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,700
Xiaoxi, come here.

563
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,140
Let's go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
to register for marriage.

564
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,740
Chu Nan!

565
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,540
I am not sure about our love.

566
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,100
I'm tired.

567
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,820
I'll head for my room.

568
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,420
I will never cheat you or hurt you.

569
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,340
Where there are you and Shen Xiaoxi,
there is me.

570
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,940
You will never feel it raining

571
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,900
since I will hold the umbrella for you.

572
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,300
You will never feel cold

573
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,980
because I will give you warmth.

574
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,740
You will never feel scared or sad.

575
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,060
Yes. I thought I would stand by you

576
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,020
silently.

577
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,260
But now I can't wait anymore.

578
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
I must be with you

579
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,580
and I will never allow anyone to hurt you and Xiaoxi.

580
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,020
Shen Qing!

581
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,740
Marry me!

582
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,020
Thank you, Mr. Xia!

583
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,620
We are not boss and employee today, aren't we?

584
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,300
I don't want to hear the rumor in the company

585
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,260
about the Xia family's sister and brother

586
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,420
tomorrow.

587
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,300
Will I gossip like that?

588
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,060
Won't you?

589
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,980
Last time it was an accident.

590
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,740
Okay. I promise

591
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,260
I won't reveal this secret to anyone,

592
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,060
even Yiyi and Amy.

593
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,580
It's only between you and me.

594
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,420
I'm leaving now.

595
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,100
Bye, Mr. Xia! Take care!

596
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,180
It's only between you and me.

597
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,900
If a secret is between two people,

598
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,380
it shows that their relationship is very special.

599
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,340
So what?

600
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,420
So,

601
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,020
we keep such a big secret of

602
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Love League.

603
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,380
Can you stop staying aloof away from the affair?

604
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,020
I've come to tell you the top secret hurriedly.

605
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,860
Can you have pity for me

606
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,940
and give me comfort?

607
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,180
I lent my car to you

608
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,700
and you took away the reason I worked.

609
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,340
But it turned out that

610
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
you let Xia Ke and Xing Yun experience

611
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,700
the test of the Fast and the Furious.

612
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,580
How do you have the face to let me comfort you?

613
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,340
I'm nice enough not to treat you
as a stupid friend.

614
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,860
How can I comfort you?

615
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,460
But I should thank Xing Yun.

616
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,900
What regrets Xia Ke most is his sister's matter.

617
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,380
If Shen Qing had said yes to

618
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,180
Ling Shan's proposal

619
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,460
or Xiaoxi had been kidnapped by him,

620
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,540
Xia Ke would have blamed himself
in the rest of his life.

621
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,180
You've really pissed me off!

622
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,780
You are caring about him

623
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,460
but he can't hear you.

624
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,820
Besides,

625
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,140
as a girl,

626
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,220
you always come here.

627
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,220
You always come

628
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,020
here.

629
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,740
Do you think Xia Ke is still missing

630
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,060
that kung fu master?

631
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,660
Everything is changing.

632
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,300
It's a long time since Xia Ke's taste changed.

633
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,340
The girls he likes

634
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,340
are such soft and lovely girls as Xing Yun.

635
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,820
Nowadays lovely girls are popular everywhere.

636
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,620
No one dislikes that type of girls.

637
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,900
You'd get rid of

638
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,500
your aggressive side.

639
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,860
I can't change

640
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,700
my nature,

641
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,260
but you can redefine

642
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,020
what kind of woman I am.

643
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
(Marriage Certificate Holders:
Shen Qing, Chu Nan)

644
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,780
What does it mean?

645
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,180
How stupid you are!

646
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,540
It means Chu Nan has become my dad.

647
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,820
Yes. You are too stupid.

648
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,460
Give us a red packet as a punishment.

649
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,460
He hasn't given me lucky money yet.

650
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,620
But how will you deal with your mom?

651
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,580
My mom…

652
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,780
Don't tell me that

653
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,900
you want to marry my sister

654
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,780
without persuading your mom.

655
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,540
How dare you say that to your brother-in-law?

656
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,900
Don't forget we have a secret weapon.

657
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,100
What secret weapon?

658
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,740
It's me.

659
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,620
My son is

660
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,260
so lovely.

661
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,220
While in the hospital,

662
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,500
he managed to persuade my mother-in-law.

663
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,860
Xia Ke, I will declare that

664
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,180
I have found my true love.

665
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,020
I've lifted all the original spells on you.

666
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,860
From now on you needn't be responsible for me

667
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,500
or feel sorry for me.

668
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,460
I'll cherish the life

669
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,420
I choose.

670
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,580
So, thank you very much, Chu Nan.

671
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,020
I'll leave her in your care.

672
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,540
Xia Ke, what toy is this?

673
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,980
Put it down.

674
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,900
I want to play with it.

675
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,380
If not, Shen Xiaoxi,

676
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,380
I won't buy any new toys for you.

677
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,460
Mom, Xia Ke is so mean!

678
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,980
When did you begin to
love this kind of cartoon toys?

679
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,300
I bought it for someone else.

680
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,580
I saw many such things in Xing Yun's home.

681
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,060
Xiaoxi, it's not a toy.

682
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,300
It's called Garage Kits.

683
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,380
What are Garage Kits?

684
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,820
Garage Kits…

685
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,500
Mom, will Xing Yun come today?

686
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,220
Yes. Besides her,

687
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,300
Xia Ke and He Yu

688
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,020
will come, too.

689
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,700
So, can I ask Xing Yun

690
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,820
to teach me how to draw?

691
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,060
Of course.

692
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
Xiaoxi,

693
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,780
since you like Xing Yun so much,

694
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,140
why not let her be your aunt?

695
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,140
Aunt?

696
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,460
Don't talk nonsense!

697
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,860
I've found Mr. He

698
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,340
is determined to win her heart.

699
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,860
Really?

700
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,380
But I think Xia Ke

701
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,380
has affections for Xing Yun, too.

702
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,900
Your words remind me that

703
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,220
they behaved differently

704
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,740
in the last team building activity.

705
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,140
My brother is a silent guy.

706
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,620
He always keeps everything to himself.

707
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,740
So, I asked them to come over

708
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,660
to join our house-warming party.

709
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,460
I want to see

710
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
what Xia Ke

711
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,260
thinks of Xing Yun.

712
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,540
Mr. Xia, is there anybody following you?

713
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,460
Are you imitating Tunnel Warfare?

714
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,220
Didn't you tell me

715
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,180
you didn't want others
to know your private affairs?

716
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,500
So, I must keep low key

717
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,260
since we are invited to Shen Qing's home
for dinner today.

718
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,340
If I am caught

719
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,380
getting a ride from you to commute,

720
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I will surely be questioned.

721
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,220
It shows you have a guilty conscience.

722
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,100
Don't you often get a ride from me?

723
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,540
You are right.

724
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,380
Safety belt!

725
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,940
I don't agree.

726
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,460
Such advertising with the purpose of quick success

727
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,740
won't not only work well

728
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,820
but also harm the customers' opinions on our brand.

729
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,780
Why?

730
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,020
Only if our promotion is expanded,

731
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,860
can the game of TIG quickly
attract the customers' attention

732
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,260
in such a fiercely competitive market.

733
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,940
The 60-second promotion keeps circulating
for 24 hours.

734
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,940
It's not attracting the customers' attention.

735
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,940
Instead, it's a torture for the customers.

736
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,460
He Yu, let me tell you.

737
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,060
Don't do anything to hurt our team

738
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,900
just because

739
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,940
you are Xia Ke's good friend.

740
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,500
TIG isn't short of money.

741
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,660
Besides,

742
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,540
Just calculate how many days do we have

743
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,500
by the end of this year?

744
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,100
Good data are helpful

745
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,940
to our project team.

746
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,540
It's because Xia Ke is my friend that

747
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,780
I'll never make such data that cost a lot of money

748
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,580
to deal with our customers.

749
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,180
Besides, I'd remind you that

750
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,940
Xia Ke is not easy to make fool of.

751
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,580
He Yu, how dare you say that?

752
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,540
Where are you going?

753
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,980
Miss Yao!

754
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,460
Are you still working? No date?

755
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,100
I haven't finished my work.
How dare I knock off?

756
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,180
But looking at the way you dress,

757
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,740
do you have a date tonight?

758
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,340
We will go to Xia Ke's sister's home for dinner.

759
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,300
Why not go there with me?

760
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,580
Forget it! I have something else to handle later.

761
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,460
You mean the online activity tomorrow?

762
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,940
I've planned it ahead of time.

763
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,620
Let's go.

764
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,740
Don't you think you've had trouble

765
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,460
with Mr. Qian recently?

766
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,500
He is so narrow-minded.

767
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,260
What he cares every day is how to

768
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,100
stop me from removing him from his position as director.

769
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,660
Last time Xia Ke protected me
with his identity of the first party

770
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,140
in the incident of Liu Shunyu.

771
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,580
Do you think he will take advantage of

772
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,220
the project of TIG to make a fuss?

773
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,060
You are really smart.

774
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,820
I don't want to waste time on him.

775
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,580
Let's go.

776
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,780
Let's go.

777
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,380
No.

778
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,620
Okay.

779
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,620
I wonder when you can win Xia Ke back

780
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,820
depending on your peculiar character.

781
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,180
We've got the picture of a goat.

782
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,420
Xiaoxi, what else do you want me to draw?

783
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,660
Draw Xia Ke.

784
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,140
Xia Ke? Let me see.

785
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,460
Give me ten more seconds.

786
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,380
Why?

787
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,940
If not, you are bullying the weak.

788
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,580
Don't think I will give in to you in anything.

789
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,700
Did you mean it?

790
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
Of course.

791
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,980
Okay. So, let's compete fairly

792
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,980
with our own skills.

793
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,700
It's done.

794
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,300
Xia Ke is a big lion.

795
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,380
Keep it down!

796
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,780
Don't be heard by the big lion.

797
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,580
Or he will eat us.

798
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,780
Okay. Let's color the lion.

799
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,620
Color here.

800
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,860
Have a try.

801
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,180
Xing Yun is really good at
getting along with children,

802
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,860
isn't she?

803
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,060
Xia Ke is an idiot.

804
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,420
He tried to date her for two years but failed.

805
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,340
But He Yu succeeded dating her ahead of him.

806
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,500
Actually, there is no order of precedence

807
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,980
but proper time for such things

808
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,020
Besides,

809
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,940
it's their own business.

810
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,620
Let nature take its course.

811
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,100
But I'd also remind

812
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,740
my stubborn brother.

813
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,740
He Yu,

814
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,220
help me take the fruit to Xiaoxi and Xing Yun.

815
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,900
No problem.

816
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,020
How can a guest do such chores?

817
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,820
No. I am not a guest.

818
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,500
Shen Qing, please regard me as your dear brother.

819
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,180
I am willing to do so.

820
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,260
Don't hesitate to tell me to do such chores.

821
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,660
You said you were not a guest, right?

822
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,380
So, go to chop the vegetables.

823
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,380
You scared me.

824
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,340
Come to eat some fruit.

825
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,780
Xiaoxi, I want to ask you a question.

826
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,580
Do you have a little girl you like very much?

827
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,740
What do you mean?

828
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,500
But I have one. She's here.

829
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,020
-Come for dinner. -I'm coming.

830
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,980
Sit across the table.

831
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,220
Why?

832
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,020
Neither of us like eating spicy food.

833
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,780
But you do.

834
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,820
So, you'd sit there.

835
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,900
I'm suffering from excessive internal heat.
I can't eat spicy food, either.

836
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,220
Really?

837
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,060
I bought the time-honored brand
Chongqing hot pot ingredients

838
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,300
for you.

839
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,460
Mr. Xia is suffering from excessive internal heat recently.

840
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,260
I can testify that.

841
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,100
Mr. Xia, sit here.

842
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,620
I can sit there to eat spicy food.

843
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,020
Stop!

844
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,460
Xing Yun, let me tell you.

845
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,500
No spicy food, no life.

846
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,580
Please do taste

847
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,980
the time-honored brand beef tallow
hot pot ingredients I bought.

848
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,780
It's hard to buy.

849
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:18,900
Okay.

850
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,180
Today, I'll thank you

851
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,060
for coming to our house-warming party.

852
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,820
I haven't experienced the feeling of home

853
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,020
for ages.

854
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,180
I cherish the atmosphere
of eating at table very much today.

855
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,100
Thank you for what you have done for me and Chu Nan.

856
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,140
Cheers!

857
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,940
Thanks! Thanks!

858
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,860
Cheers! Cheers!

859
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,740
Eat this quickly!

860
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,300
(Qing, do you have game props
for Infinite Unknown Love?)

861
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,860
Momo wants me to ask you for game props again.

862
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,140
Okay, okay. I know why even if you don't tell me.

863
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,060
Who is Momo?

864
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,260
The assistant in my studio.

865
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Recently she has been addicted
to the new game of their company.

866
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,980
You can ask her to go on X website

867
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,540
to rush for the game props tomorrow morning.

868
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,620
The props can be seen as the advance sale promotion of

869
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,300
before our project goes online.

870
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,380
Only 1,000 props.

871
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,540
You can rush for the prop card
worth 99 yuan with one yuan.

872
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,900
The card can be used in the game instance.

873
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,500
Where can we get them?

874
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,500
Right here.

875
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,900
This is the cooperation between X website and us.

876
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,500
Only 1,000 copies.

877
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,500
(One yuan for props worth 99 yuan.
Selling. Stocks: 99135)

878
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,900
What ten o'clock?

879
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,260
Obviously the prop cards can be gotten now.

880
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,220
It's impossible!

881
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,020
(Stocks: 83472)

882
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,420
Sorry. The number you dialed is not answered.

883
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,980
Still no answer?

884
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,060
Xing Yun, what's wrong?

885
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,100
Not only has the time changed,

886
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,260
but also the existing stock has changed
from 1,000 to 100,000.

887
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,260
100,000?

888
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,180
If every prop needs to be bought

889
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,580
with one yuan,

890
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,980
we'll lose one million yuan.

891
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,100
Now the system has broken down.

892
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,180
Yao Qing, have you heard the news?

893
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,020
Mr. Qian has come.

894
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,940
He's waiting for you in the office.

895
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,820
What's most important now is
to solve the problem first.

896
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,060
Have the personnel
from the Back-Stage Promotion Department come?

897
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,980
First, close the trading range.

898
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,940
Try to reduce the loss to the minimum.

899
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,460
We don't have to solve the problem.
