00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,620
=Episode 14=

3
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,420
What did you dream?

4
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,820
What did you dream?

5
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,060
Mom, you scared me.

6
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,180
Why did I scare you?

7
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,380
What did you dream?

8
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,220
You seemed to enjoy it.

9
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,740
-Here. -No.

10
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,780
You also said

11
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,060
Xia Ke. Xia Ke.

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,340
I can guess what you dreamed.

13
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,500
How do you know it?

14
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,940
You must dream that he promoted you
and increased your salary.

15
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,380
Mom, my head hurts.

16
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,540
It's because you drank so much last night.

17
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,660
You came back drunk, so your head aches.

18
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,020
Is it real?

19
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,420
Mom, how did I come back last night?

20
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,220
You even forgot this?

21
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,420
Yun. Yun.

22
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Mom, I miss you so much.

23
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,820
How come you are so drunk?

24
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,620
Yes.

25
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,820
Who, who are you?

26
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
How come she is so drunk?

27
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,860
I'm her friend. I'm called He Yu.

28
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,460
Sorry, Mr Xing.

29
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Such a thing won't happen again.

30
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,540
Too embarrassing.

31
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
I won't drink any more.

32
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,020
But He Yu is pretty polite.

33
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,140
I think he cares about you.

34
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,180
Mom, you've thought too much.

35
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,820
He is our company's customer now.

36
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,620
Customer?

37
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,180
Didn't you say

38
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,100
you went to participate
in the classmate reunion yesterday?

39
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,580
Mom, I suddenly realize that I need to take a bath.

40
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,500
I will be late.

41
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,220
I have to take a bath now.

42
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,620
I'm late. I'm late. I'm late.

43
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,140
I'm late.

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,220
Morning.

45
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,620
You also live in this community?
How coincidental!

46
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,100
How can this be possible?

47
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,420
Is my intention not obvious enough?

48
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,420
I came to pick you up for work.

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,860
Don't be so polite.

50
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,060
Aren't you going to talk to me?

51
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,780
For what?

52
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,700
For the thing last night.

53
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,980
Last night?

54
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
Last, last night…

55
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,420
Last night,

56
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,540
I shouldn't meet Xia Ke.

57
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,660
Did I kiss him?

58
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,780
Well, last night…

59
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
You haven't had breakfast, right?

60
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,860
This sandwich is delicious.

61
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,020
No. Bu-but…

62
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,900
Eat it.

63
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,220
Thank you.

64
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,260
Did we always stay together last night?

65
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,940
Sure.

66
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,740
I, I want to ask

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,140
whether we met some acquaintances.

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,060
Staying with me,

69
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,300
you also want to meet an acquaintance?

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,240
Then besides drinking wine,

71
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,220
did we do other things last night?

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,700
You don't remember it?

73
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,340
This expression, this line…

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
Over, over.

75
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,460
I really kissed him.

76
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,260
You want to ask me

77
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,900
to pretend nothing had happened

78
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,500
as you were drunk last night?

79
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,540
Xing Yun, Xing Yun,

80
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,700
you acted shamelessly after you got drunk.

81
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,140
How can you tell him

82
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,180
that you took him as Xia Ke

83
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,980
when you kissed him?

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,580
That will hurt him a lot.

85
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,900
You don't really want to deny it, right?

86
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,140
No. I didn't mean to ask you

87
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,140
to pretend nothing had happened.

88
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,100
But I didn't mean that indeed.

89
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,780
I've been working for

90
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,100
the game related to love.

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,820
And I've tried to experience it.

92
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
So I'm a little bit confused now.

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,500
So you said a lot

94
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,780
to get rid of your responsibility?

95
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,700
Re-responsible? Is it so serious?

96
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,980
Then, then, let me think about it.

97
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,700
I can consider

98
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,620
how to take the responsibility.

99
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,020
Just be my girlfriend.

100
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,940
All right. I won't force you.

101
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,380
Think about it.

102
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,100
I can give you one week.

103
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,500
One week later,

104
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,060
give me a satisfactory answer.

105
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,940
Wait!

106
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,980
Mr. Xia, what a coincidence.

107
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,460
I'm going to be late.

108
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,540
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

109
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,300
No. I really, I really need…

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,540
I'm going to be late.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,620
Don't close the door. No.

112
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,140
Mr. Xia, my attendance bonus of this month…

113
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Accompany me to buy a cup of coffee.

114
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
The company provides coffee.

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,260
Last night… Mr. Xia.

116
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,980
What happened last night?

117
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,820
How is your sleep last night?

118
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,260
Not bad, and you?

119
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,540
I failed to get asleep all night.

120
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,020
Why?

121
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,300
Sure, you can refuse to answer me if you like.

122
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,420
Don't you have anything to ask me?

123
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,020
Huh?

124
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,500
I mean what do you think in your mind?

125
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,460
I do have some load on my mind.

126
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,580
But you surely won't be interested in it.

127
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,220
Tell me first.

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,020
You asked me to tell you.

129
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,300
Here is the thing.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,660
First of all, it's not my business,

131
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,500
but my friend's.

132
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,100
Let me introduce the background first.

133
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,060
On a dark and windy night,

134
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,820
she got so drunk

135
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,020
that she couldn't even recognize

136
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,220
her real mom standing in front of her.

137
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,940
Got it?

138
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,900
Then,

139
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,940
then she actually

140
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,860
kissed with a man she doesn't like.

141
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,260
She doesn't like him?

142
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,660
She doesn't like him.

143
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,580
Although that man is good looking

144
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,660
with good conditions,

145
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,380
she doesn't like him.

146
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,260
Do you understand?

147
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,780
No, what should I understand?

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,100
If you don't like him,

149
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
would you kiss him so seriously?

150
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,020
I didn't tell you this.

151
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,460
Didn't, didn't you?

152
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,460
Yes.

153
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,340
But I also told you she was too drunk

154
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,740
to recognize her real mom.

155
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,460
So how could she recognize whom she kissed with?

156
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,140
You know what?

157
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,700
Let me explain this in this way.

158
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,140
It's like telling the truth after getting drunk.

159
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,580
In her sub-consciousness,

160
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,740
she wanted to kiss that man.

161
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,260
No. In fact, I…

162
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
my friend

163
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,740
took that man

164
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,220
for another man.

165
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,460
She said she did feel good for that kiss.

166
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,460
But now she doesn't know

167
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,500
that one who made her feel good

168
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,060
is that man she kissed

169
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,020
or that man she has in mind.

170
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,500
Surely it's that man she kissed.

171
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,260
Why?

172
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Let me use a metaphor.

173
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,660
They are like the latte you drink

174
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,660
and the mocha I drink.

175
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,900
You usually like latte.

176
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,700
But you suddenly bought mocha today.

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,740
After tasting it, you found

178
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,980
mocha also tastes pretty good.

179
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,020
But you also don't want to give up latte.

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,620
Then tell me.

181
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,220
Which one do you prefer, latte or mocha?

182
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,820
Mo-mocha?

183
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,180
Yes. Mocha.

184
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,900
So you must tell your friend

185
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,020
to cherish that man

186
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,340
who made her feel good after a kiss.

187
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,140
But is he experienced in date

188
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,020
so that she really enjoyed kissing him?

189
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,220
How come

190
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,060
he is experienced?

191
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,140
Even if he dated before,

192
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,220
he wouldn't feel anything special

193
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,580
if  his kiss isn't sincere.

194
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,620
So instead,

195
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,860
the man who made your friend feel so good

196
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,900
must also like her sincerely.

197
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,380
How did you know this?

198
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,100
Because when I fall in love with someone,

199
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,780
or when I hope I will be loved by someone,

200
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,060
I will take it seriously and sincerely.

201
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,900
You can tell your friend

202
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,460
my words.

203
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,780
Were I your friend,

204
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,940
I would go to find that man

205
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,580
to tell him her love.

206
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,020
But my friend hasn't been prepared for this yet.

207
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,020
She works with that man.

208
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,140
She might not be prepared for it.

209
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,060
You are right.

210
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,900
But this man

211
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,420
should also be willing to wait for her.

212
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,060
I just took a sip of it.

213
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,900
Would you like to continue to take it?

214
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,180
Mr. Xia, morning.

215
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,100
Don't you have something to tell me?

216
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,500
(Xing Yun: My boss keeps asking me "Don't you have
something to say to me?". What's the meaning?)

217
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,660
When did she post this?

218
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,980
Last night.

219
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,340
Why didn't I see this?

220
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,900
She must shield the boss

221
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,260
when she speaks ill of the boss.

222
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,100
However,

223
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,180
she forgot to shield the boss's sister.

224
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,020
You even laugh.

225
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,500
Why don't you tell her that you love her?

226
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,740
I've discussed this with her.

227
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,220
She cares about our business relationship.

228
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,020
So I think

229
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
I can wait

230
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,540
until she thinks it through.

231
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,980
Do you want her to think it through?

232
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,380
You asked her questions all day long.

233
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,460
Does she have time to think about this?

234
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,740
You know what?

235
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,300
Man should be mighty

236
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,660
and considerate when needed.

237
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,540
So?

238
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,780
So, so you should give her some time.

239
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,860
Don't disturb her.

240
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,940
Anyway, turning the boss into boyfriend

241
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,300
still brings some pressure to her.

242
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,380
This is the last revised edition

243
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,620
of our promotion video.

244
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,220
If you don't have any suggestion,

245
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,340
we will begin to prepare to

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,900
release the  work later.

247
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,900
I believe this promotion video

248
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,660
should bring a nice forecast effect

249
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,300
to the final release of our instance zones.

250
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,900
All right. Everybody.

251
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,700
That's it today.

252
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,420
Thank you for your hard work.

253
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,060
Dismiss.

254
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,100
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

255
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,220
Mr. Xia, and the question of Technology Department.

256
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,700
I…

257
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,940
Discuss it with Director Wang.

258
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,740
Let's go.

259
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,500
This…

260
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,180
How is it? Is it good?

261
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,740
He Yu chose this.

262
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,500
He finally did something seriously now.

263
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,460
I've checked it.

264
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,860
The outside environment is good.

265
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,980
There is also a pretty big dining room inside.

266
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,860
Underground is the wine cellar.

267
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,820
Where is he?

268
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,100
He left for Shanghai for a business trip.

269
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,100
Well, let me introduce.

270
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
This is the owner of the manor, Mr. Zhuang.

271
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,260
He is also a master in tasting wine.

272
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,020
And Mr. Zhuang,

273
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,380
this is General Manager Xia of our TIG.

274
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,020
Uncle Zhuang, long time no see.

275
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,820
Yes.

276
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,660
You haven't been here for a while.

277
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,660
Yes.

278
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,860
You know each other?

279
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,140
We are family friends.

280
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
I watched him grow up.

281
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,540
Well, and his friend called He Yu.

282
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,620
They often come to my place.

283
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,660
I made a mistake.

284
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,420
You must be familiar

285
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,660
with those He Yu knows.

286
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,340
Mr. Zhuang, please forgive my ignorance.

287
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,220
Never mind.

288
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,860
I didn't expect you also know Miss Yao.

289
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,100
Xia Ke, you must seize

290
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,580
smart and excellent girls

291
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,100
like Miss Yao.

292
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,060
Excuse me. I'd like to go pick some wine.

293
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,420
Okay.

294
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,220
Here. Xia Ke. Take a walk.

295
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,860
I didn't expect He Yu would order your place.

296
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,260
We'll trouble you again.

297
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,260
Don't be so polite.

298
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,260
I also didn't expect

299
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,340
my manor would be your secret base actually.

300
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,700
He told me later

301
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,780
why he chose my manor

302
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,340
to hold the company's party.

303
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,540
For chasing a girl.

304
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,500
His tricks of chasing girls

305
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,020
are enough for writing a book.

306
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,260
But this time he prepares such a great scene,

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,700
which shows that he likes that girl sincerely.

308
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,540
Is it good, Xing Yun?

309
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,940
It looks good.

310
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,340
But won't it be too formal?

311
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,900
I want a good look. Good look means everything.

312
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,020
So expensive.

313
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Didn't you check the price inside?

314
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,660
I saw it.

315
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,620
I can bear it.

316
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,060
After all, this Thursday, we are going…

317
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,460
What will you do?

318
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,060
For live broadcast, right?

319
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,980
The live broadcast industry has been
so competitive recently.

320
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,220
You will have no audience if you don't dress well.

321
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,940
Yes. You are pretty.

322
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,540
But the cost is not low.

323
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,220
What do you like?

324
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,020
Is it okay for you to wear this?

325
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
I want to change my style.

326
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,580
To be serious,

327
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,380
how about we go to have hot pot on Thursday after work?

328
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,020
Thu-Thursday?

329
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,260
I have an engagement.

330
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,780
What's going on?

331
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,300
Didn't we make a deal that

332
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,540
Thursday is the activity day for us
three house girls in our lifetime?

333
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,300
But you have live broadcast and you have an appointment.

334
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,580
What do you mean?

335
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,980
So-sorry. It's a special situation.

336
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,420
How about I treat you next week?

337
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,340
Okay? Next week.

338
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes, yes, yes.

339
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,100
You don't have high-heeled shoes?

340
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,500
I don't have any.

341
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,540
Then let's go buy shoes later.

342
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,660
Come on.

343
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,700
I'll try on clothes first.

344
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,860
Get changed back.

345
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,620
Go.

346
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,740
Is my lipstick nice?

347
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,180
I think it's not bright enough.

348
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,940
Try mine.

349
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,060
I've brought my own lipsticks here.

350
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,580
Isn't it Thursday today?

351
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,340
Why do all people have engagements?

352
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,980
Hu.

353
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,740
Xing Yun.

354
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,460
This is not your style.

355
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,020
Really?

356
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
You look handsome.

357
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,380
Where are you going tonight?

358
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,420
I'm busy. I have to go.

359
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,380
Okay.

360
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,380
(He Yu: I'm waiting for you downstairs)

361
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,280
(He Yu: I'm waiting for you downstairs)

362
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,300
Why is he here?

363
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,660
I heard that you left for a business trip.

364
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,060
Yes.

365
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,140
I flew back this morning.

366
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,060
Do you miss me?

367
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,620
You're thinking too much.

368
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,660
Is this what you will wear tonight?

369
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,900
Is there any problem?

370
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,380
If you dress like this today,

371
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,060
you might regret.

372
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,460
What do you mean?

373
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,020
Never mind. We still have time.

374
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,020
Get in my car now.

375
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,420
What?

376
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,540
Do you know what a woman

377
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,580
worries about the most

378
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,660
when she learns she might become the focus?

379
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,620
She worries that she is not dressed well enough.

380
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,940
Try it.

381
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,500
What focus? What did you say?

382
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,980
I don't understand

383
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,140
what you are saying today.

384
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,540
I mean

385
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,060
you will become the focus tonight.

386
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,020
So please be responsible

387
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,940
for your image.

388
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,100
Me? Why?

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,340
Because you are in charge of the project.

390
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,460
You are bound to the focus of the party tonight.

391
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,820
What party?

392
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,780
The party of TIG and Jiawo.

393
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,180
You didn't know?

394
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,540
I know nothing of it.

395
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,020
Why do we hold a party?

396
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,220
It was decided last week.

397
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,260
Because we have a smooth cooperation.

398
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,540
Before the release of the video,

399
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,460
we two companies have a party in advance.

400
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,140
You really don't know this?

401
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,900
After all, this Thursday, we are going…

402
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,860
I have an engagement.

403
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,660
Where are you going tonight?

404
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,620
I have to go.

405
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,460
Okay.

406
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,340
But never mind.

407
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,460
I also want to invite you to be my female companion.

408
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,420
You agreed?

409
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,660
I just want to see

410
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,700
whether I'm betrayed by all of them.

411
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,620
Very good.

412
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,860
Xing Yun comes.

413
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,700
Mr. He Yu and Miss Xing Yun.

414
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,260
Xing Yun comes.

415
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,260
Xing Yun, hi.

416
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,780
Well, sit between us. Come here.

417
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,500
Take a seat.

418
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,820
Let me change one for you.

419
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,300
We've been waiting for you for long.

420
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,220
Here is a clean plate.

421
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,460
And clean knives and forks. Here you are.

422
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,940
Sit here for a while.

423
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,380
I have something to prepare.

424
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,700
Xing Yun, have some bread.

425
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,500
Here. Let me slice some for you.

426
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,260
Come on. Eat this.

427
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,780
This one.

428
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,340
Eat this one.

429
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,140
Xing Yun, have a taste.

430
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,180
I've sliced it for you.

431
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,860
Here, have a taste.

432
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,860
Xing Yun, don't be angry.

433
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,740
I didn't expect

434
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,020
you two also betrayed me.

435
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,220
We really were forced.

436
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,180
Mr. Xia asked us to hide it from you.

437
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,900
Did I offend him?

438
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm in charge

439
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,820
of this project anyway.

440
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,460
Does he really want
to kick me out of the project unit?

441
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,460
I don't think so.

442
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,020
Miss Yao.

443
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,460
He Yu has a good taste.

444
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,980
This skirt fits you so much.

445
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,460
Let's go.

446
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,780
In fact, I really think

447
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,060
Mr. Xia asked us to hide it from you

448
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,940
because of Miss Yao.

449
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,820
Miss Yao?

450
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,980
Right?

451
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,500
I think Mr. Xia

452
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,100
must have something to do with Miss Yao.

453
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,740
Isn't this fresh?

454
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,860
She, Mr. Xia and He Yu

455
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,420
were classmates as well as best friends

456
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,460
when they learned abroad.

457
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,140
What else do you know?

458
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
She takes a fancy on Mr. Xia.

459
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
I've learned this early before.

460
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,060
I heard that when Mr. Xia just came back from abroad,

461
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,340
he worked as an internship in Jiawo.

462
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,260
Then he resigned and started his own business

463
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,980
for Miss Yao.

464
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,700
Office romance is not permitted in Jiawo.

465
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,620
No way.

466
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,940
You know what?

467
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,820
Last time when Mr. Xia went to Shanghai
for a business trip,

468
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,300
I called his hotel room late at night.

469
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,740
And Yao Qing answered my call.

470
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,140
It makes sense.

471
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,260
Since Mr. Xia came back from Shanghai,

472
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,060
Miss Yao has been responsible
for the project of the instance zones.

473
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,660
Did she give up the job in Shanghai

474
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,780
for Mr. Xia?

475
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,740
That's pretty romantic.

476
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,420
Xing Yun, what do you think?

477
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,940
Her relationship with Xia Ke

478
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
has nothing to do with me.

479
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,060
Why am I isolated?

480
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,540
Well, maybe you worked as

481
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,340
his personal assistant before.

482
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,580
He may prevent Miss Yao
from misunderstanding this.

483
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,100
So that's clear

484
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,460
why Mr. Xia

485
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
is isolated from you this week.

486
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,220
Maybe he dates Yao Qing again

487
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,060
and isolates you
for avoiding arousing suspicion.

488
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,700
Avoid arousing suspicion?

489
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,540
Yes.

490
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,500
Let's have a meal first.

491
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,740
We are back.

492
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,180
Miss Xing, you are so beautiful today.

493
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,540
Thank you.

494
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,220
He Yu chose it for you, right?

495
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,660
He never took the morning flight before.

496
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,460
But for you, he took it

497
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,420
to rush back.

498
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,540
Come to the yard.

499
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,260
Someone lets off fireworks.

500
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,220
Go. Let's go to take some photos.

501
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,780
Go, go, go.

502
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,460
Go to have a look.

503
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,860
Go, go, go.

504
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,140
Hey.

505
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,020
You can't go out.

506
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,940
Mr. Xia, what do you mean exactly?

507
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,100
I also want to ask you

508
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,980
why you came here with him?

509
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,660
I want to ask you

510
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,100
why you hide the party thing from me?

511
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,460
Because I think you are not suitable for it.

512
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,580
I'm not suitable?

513
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,340
All people in the Project Department
except me came.

514
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,740
So they are suitable and I'm not?

515
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,940
Others didn't entangle with

516
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,180
the project manager of the cooperated company.

517
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,140
What?

518
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,020
You mean He Yu and me?

519
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,260
Didn't you come here to be his companion?

520
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,340
For such a thing,

521
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,940
I think you are not better than me.

522
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,260
If I want to meet He Yu,

523
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,660
I can meet him easily.

524
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,580
I don't need to make an excuse of work.

525
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,940
You also want to meet him all the time?

526
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,140
I mean I make a clear distinction
between public and personal things.

527
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,380
Since then,

528
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,220
why does he wait outside

529
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,060
to profess his love to you?

530
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,180
Does it have something to do with you?

531
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,100
You… Xia Ke.

532
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,900
Don't you go out to watch the fireworks?

533
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,820
Did I disturb you?

534
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,060
No. I'm leaving now.

535
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,380
Goodbye, Mr. Xia.

536
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,180
Go.

537
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,860
Where are you going?

538
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,700
Go home.

539
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,620
No. Don't, don't you look up to the sky?

540
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,700
This…

541
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,940
Before the fireworks end,

542
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,820
the hero and heroine elope.

543
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,180
Thank you. Take care on your way back.

544
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,660
Do you know

545
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,260
why I took the earliest flight

546
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,740
to come back?

547
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,580
No.

548
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Because it

549
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,860
has been a whole week today.

550
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,060
Think about it.

551
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,780
I give you one week.

552
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,220
One week later,

553
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,700
give me a satisfactory answer.

554
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,900
You haven't considered

555
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,660
our thing, right?

556
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
In, in fact, I'm not

557
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,820
good at dating.

558
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,500
I want a girlfriend,

559
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
not a dating tutor.

560
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,620
But I'm foolish and boring.

561
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,700
I want love

562
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,900
not a crosstalk show.

563
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,180
I know you are not sure

564
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,060
whether you love me or not.

565
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,940
But dating

566
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,060
will make it clear increasingly.

567
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,260
Don't worry.

568
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,380
I must let you fall in love with me.

569
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,060
Let's have a try.

570
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,700
But she doesn't know

571
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,660
that one who made her feel good

572
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,500
is that man she kissed

573
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,060
or that man she has in mind.

574
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,500
Surely it's that man she kissed.

575
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,980
Although that man is good looking

576
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,060
with good conditions,

577
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,900
she doesn't like him.

578
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,460
Sorry.

579
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,180
I know you are very good.

580
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,300
I even feel that I also like you.

581
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,180
But I need to tell you that,

582
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,420
when I kissed you in the restaurant that day,

583
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,460
I thought of another man.

584
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,820
Although I ordered latte,

585
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,700
I have mocha in my mind.

586
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,540
What are you talking about?

587
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,740
Anyway, don't waste time

588
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,620
on me.

589
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,460
I don't like you. Bye.

590
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,420
Waiter, one more bottle of liquor.

591
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,660
Stop drinking it.

592
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,500
It's not suitable for you to get drunk.

593
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,380
It's a rare chance.

594
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,900
None will give me

595
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,460
anti-alcoholic drug and honey water today.

596
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,340
If you want to know

597
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
whether she has promised He Yu or not,

598
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,100
you can just call her directly.

599
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,980
Here. Call her. Call her now.

600
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,020
Why didn't I realize

601
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,620
I like her so much?

602
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,500
Xia Ke.

603
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,340
If you really like someone,

604
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,500
you shouldn't keep it in your heart.

605
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,780
What if she has

606
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,540
promised He Yu tonight?

607
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,380
It doesn't depend on her but you.

608
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,740
How will you do?

609
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,580
I don't know.

610
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,060
Stop drinking.

611
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
My liquor! Quick!

612
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,740
After making a great scene,

613
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,180
you were declined with a good-man card.

614
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,780
Such an experience must

615
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,900
be rare for you.

616
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,220
Just a failed confession.

617
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,460
It's not the first time

618
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,660
and won't be the last time.

619
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,500
I haven't given up yet.

620
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,700
By the way,

621
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,220
did Xia Ke send you back yesterday?

622
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,700
I'm not sure.

623
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,700
I acted as Agony Aunt

624
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,900
in a bar for the whole night yesterday.

625
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,100
Did I hear that right?

626
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,500
Xia Ke has such a vulnerable moment?

627
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,420
He Yu, don't try to ignore it any more.

628
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,500
Xia Ke likes Xing Yun.

629
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,300
Didn't we know this before?

630
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,060
But Xia Ke didn't know this.

631
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,300
But I believe that, after last night,

632
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,900
Xia Ke has known it.

633
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,380
You and I have no doubt about

634
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,980
the fighting strength of Xia Ke
who has been wakened.

635
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,700
Since you are also declined,

636
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,580
I think we can just give up.

637
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,860
Come on, cheer up.

638
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,380
Okay?

639
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,100
You know what?

640
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,940
Your greatest weakness

641
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,140
is that you are too calm.

642
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I think you had a chance yesterday.

643
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,660
After he got drunk,

644
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,940
you should have pounced on him directly.

645
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,540
He was picked up by his sister.

646
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,300
Xia Ke, how come you are so drunk?

647
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,020
Miss Shen Qing.

648
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
Yao Qing, long time no see.

649
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,900
Just now Xia Ke texted me

650
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
and asked me to pick him up.

651
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,900
Go. I can give you a ride.

652
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,860
Okay. Thank you.

653
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,900
She said she sent me home on the way.

654
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,820
But in fact, we were like shifting of duty.

655
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,300
She kept telling me

656
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,660
how much her brother loves Xing Yun.

657
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,340
Miss Shen Qing is not simple.

658
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,860
The meeting this morning
has been cancelled as well.

659
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,300
We can't get in touch with him.

660
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,740
What's going on?

661
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,340
That's not like Mr. Xia's style.

662
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,380
We parted in discord yesterday.

663
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,460
And he doesn't come to work today.

664
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Does this have something to do with me?

665
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,420
(Shen Qing)

666
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,100
Hello, Miss Shen Qing.

667
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,540
Xing Yun.

668
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,740
Can you please go to Xia Ke's house?

669
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,180
He seems to be in trouble.

670
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,500
What's up?

671
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
I don't know it either.

672
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,100
Xiaoxi's teacher asked me to go to school.

673
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,540
And Chu Nan can't ask for leave.

674
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,860
He sounds very terrible.

675
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,100
He seems seriously ill.

676
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay, I know.

677
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,300
I'll get there right away.

678
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,100
Amy, I have to leave for some business.

679
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,900
Help me to ask for leave.

680
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,980
Where are you going?

681
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,820
You are cheating Xing Yun.

682
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,820
You sent Xia Ke home yesterday.

683
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,580
How come you told her
you know nothing about him?

684
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,300
In addition, we have time.

685
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,540
Xia Ke never made

686
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
himself drunk like that.

687
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,180
He got drunk

688
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,180
because of Xing Yun only.

689
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,220
Their problem should be solved by themselves.

690
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,420
Moreover, I didn't lie totally.

691
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,100
He sounds very decadent in the phone this morning.

692
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,180
Compared with giving Xia Ke medicine,

693
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,900
we'd better send Xing Yun to him.

694
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,540
No wonder he doesn't answer the calls.

695
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,740
Mr. Xia.

696
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,820
Mr. Xia.

697
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,780
Mr. Xia. I'm Xing Yun.

698
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,340
Are you inside?

699
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,660
Mr. Xia.

700
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,380
Then I come in.

701
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,060
Gosh, how much liquor did you drink?

702
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,740
Mr. Xia.

703
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Mr. Xia. You have a fever.

704
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,460
Unexpectedly, you having a lion of bad temper

705
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,860
would become a sick cat someday.

706
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,860
You always lose your temper for no reason.

707
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,380
Be fierce again if you can.

708
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,300
If it's not for the sake of Miss Shen Qing,

709
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,500
I won't care about you.

710
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,460
Hello, Mom.

711
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,340
Do me a favor.

712
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,780
Can you teach me how to cook some simple dishes?

713
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,820
Are you are a wandering ghost? You walk silently.

714
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,940
I didn't remember
that I summoned the mascot to my house.

715
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,780
If it wasn't Miss Shen Qing,

716
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,940
I wouldn't leave my work

717
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,220
and come here to challenge myself.

718
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,300
Mr. Xia, it seems that
you don't have a good capacity for liquor.

719
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,780
You got drunk twice in recent days.

720
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,100
Are, are you qualified for criticizing me?

721
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,820
I think someone…

722
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,180
Kiss.

723
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,740
I mean you and He Yu.

724
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,860
I, I, I want to say that,

725
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,540
the environment is easy to create illusion.

726
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,580
If you made a wrong decision

727
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,260
for the temporarily wonderful fireworks,

728
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,500
you will surely regret.

729
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,980
What did you say?

730
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,740
In other words,

731
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,300
it's naive for you to make a decision

732
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,500
to take revenge on me

733
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,700
because of getting angry with me.

734
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,260
What are you talking about?

735
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,740
Are you confused because of fever?

736
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,860
I don't understand what you said at all.

737
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,740
Did you promise He Yu?

738
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,300
You mean last night?

739
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,620
No.

740
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,100
Originally, I also wanted to consider it.

741
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,940
But because of the sudden changes in your attitude,

742
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,900
I didn't have time to think about it.

743
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,260
Mocha and la…

744
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,300
That's too hard for me.

745
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,380
I can't make it clear.

746
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,740
So I'd better follow my heart.

747
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,340
Although Manager He is pretty good,

748
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,100
I don't like him.

749
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,540
Then I want to tell you something.

750
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,980
Xing Yun. Mr. Xia.

751
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,060
Kicking down the ladder

752
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,180
is very shameful.

753
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,620
You won't transfer me back to the Art Unit, right?

754
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,220
Do you know what is called atmosphere?

755
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,180
Xing Yun, I seldom eat at home.

756
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,140
But just now I really feel

757
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,620
the domestic smoke you said.

758
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,100
I think we can…

759
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,300
Xing Yun, I want to say…

760
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,060
Why don't you answer the phone first?

761
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:46,900
Hello.

762
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,420
What did you say?

763
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,340
For Jiawo Media,

764
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,300
the most important thing is the advertising channel.

765
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,860
Besides He Yu and Yao Qing, others get out.

766
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,500
Quick!

767
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,860
Get away!

768
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,740
Do you have sore asses? Run away!

769
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,020
Director Qian.

770
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,220
What's your brilliant suggestion?

771
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,260
Are you still in the mood for a meeting?

772
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,380
I don't think

773
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,140
you can smile later.

774
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,860
Xing Yun. Xing Yun.

775
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,980
Xing Yun. Xing Yun. Sorry.

776
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,700
Director Wang asked me to pack all of your stuff

777
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,060
and place it in the meeting room just now.

778
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,380
Why?

779
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,340
Mr. Xia, people of Jiawo will come soon.

780
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,980
What do you mean?

781
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,620
Did I do something wrong?

782
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,100
Are you Xing Yun?

783
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,380
Do you know Lin Jing from Huize Game?

784
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,860
Mr. Xia, sorry.

785
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,420
There was a delay on the way.

786
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,100
Man-manager Duan, Director Wang, Director Qian.

787
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,860
All is here.

788
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,740
I think we can ask Xing Yun

789
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,620
to come in after we finish the discussion.

790
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,700
She is just a small planner
for the instance zones after all.

791
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,660
No.

792
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,740
She doesn't participate in the meeting

793
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,580
as the leader of instance zones.

794
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,740
She is now a leak suspect.
