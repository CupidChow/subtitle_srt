00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,590
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,510
Xiaoxi.

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,760
What's wrong?

5
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,480
He usually doesn't sleep at this time of day.

6
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,830
And he has a fever.

7
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,520
I'll get my mom here.

8
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,880
39°C.

9
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Nothing wrong with the wounds.

10
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,190
Post-operative fever is very common.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Don't be too nervous.

12
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,630
We'll check
if a bacterial infection has happened.

13
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll prescribe him some medicine
in time if necessary.

14
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,190
Observe carefully tonight.

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,470
You've stayed here for two nights.

16
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,470
You need to have a good rest.

17
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Let me take care of him tonight.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,630
No.

19
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,270
Let me do it.

20
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,080
Mr. Chu, it's none of your business.

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,390
You can leave.

22
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,720
Hello? This is Amy
from Administration Dept. of TIG.

23
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,390
It's me.

24
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,470
Mr. Xia, I was about to call you.

25
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,160
I've emailed you the materials

26
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,110
for the meeting at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

27
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,800
You haven't shown up by now.

28
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,110
Shall I postpone it a little?

29
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,030
Cancel it.

30
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
As for the meeting with operators,

31
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,520
use videoconferencing.

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,320
Okay. Got it.

33
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh. Take my computer

34
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,800
to Chaoxin Hospital.

35
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,390
Okay. Got it.

36
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,440
What's up? I'm in a hurry.

37
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,520
Take it.

38
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,270
What's up?

39
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,240
Period stains.

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,360
No wonder I have a stomachache.

41
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,320
My dress is stained?

42
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,190
Take the computer to Mr. Xia.

43
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
He's at Chaoxin Hospital. Hurry up.

44
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,440
Chaoxin Hospital.

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,600
Chaoxin Hospital.

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,200
(Are you alright?
I'll wait for your reply)

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,790
His condition is not bad.

48
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,200
He's getting better after the operation.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,300
(Xing Yun)

50
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,000
Why didn't Xia Ke answer the phone?

51
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,480
Is Xiaoxi hospitalized here?

52
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,320
But I think Shen Qing would take him

53
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,670
to go to a private hospital.

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,880
So, why is Mr. Xia here?

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,950
Has he really got a head injury?

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,510
If it's true, I'll get into big trouble.

57
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,040
Which Dept. should we go to treat head injuries?

58
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,760
Dept. of Brain. On the second floor.

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Come on.

60
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,280
(Five missed calls from Xing Yun
One missed call from Amy)

61
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,390
Mr. Xia, I have an emergency.

62
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,230
I've asked Xing Yun to take the computer to you.

63
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,510
She'll call you when she's there.

64
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,550
Sorry for any inconvenience.

65
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,510
Chu Nan, I hope you think carefully

66
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,670
before you say anything.

67
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,720
I won't let you hurt my sister

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,830
or Xing Yun.

69
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,160
Sorry. I didn't watch where I was going.

70
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,200
My bad.

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Hello? Mr. Xia.

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,160
Where are you?

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,920
Wait for me at the Registration Office
on the first floor.

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,230
Okay. Hold on.

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,760
Mr. Xia.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,830
Come on. Did I really guess right?

77
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,510
Are you here to treat a head injury?

78
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,440
No.

79
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,670
That'd be great.

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
So, why are you here?

81
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,270
Is Xiaoxi hospitalized here?

82
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,830
Yeah.

83
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,350
I have a meeting this afternoon.

84
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm going back.

85
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Tell Xiaoxi

86
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,230
I'll come see him some other day.

87
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,320
Hold on.

88
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,670
I'll send you home.

89
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,920
Xia Ke.

90
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
You don't need to see me off.

91
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,200
I'll take a taxi.

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,950
What's up?

93
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,920
Amy.

94
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,270
Where?

95
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,270
I mistook someone else for her.

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,950
Don't move. There is something on your head.

97
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,160
I just washed my…

98
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,160
Don't move.

99
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,070
…my hair this morning.

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,790
I'm telling you.

101
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,040
There is a traffic jam at the east gate.

102
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,600
It's better to go to the south gate.

103
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,200
Hello?

104
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Can you wait for me at the south gate?

105
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,320
That's right.

106
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,510
Can you stop pushing me? Mr. Xia.

107
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,760
Hurry up. There is no time.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,040
38°C.

109
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
The fever is going down finally.

110
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,070
Don't worry.

111
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,950
Ms. Lan usually deals with

112
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,440
difficult miscellaneous diseases.

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,080
Relax. Xiaoxi will be alright.

114
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,320
Thank you.

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:28,840
It's okay.

116
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,910
Isn't it the east gate?

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,350
Why are we here?

118
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,000
We usually go to the ring road
from the east gate.

119
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,200
It's the best route.

120
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,710
Isn't there a traffic jam here?

121
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,150
No. There isn't at this time of day.

122
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,200
Wait! Stop the car, please.

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,590
Sir, I'm sorry. I have to get off,

124
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,520
but I'll pay, anyway.

125
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
(Are you alright?
I'll wait for your reply)

126
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,030
Chu Nan!

127
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,550
It's really you.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,960
Why are you here?

129
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,000
You said something happened to your family.

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,520
Is anyone hospitalized?

131
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,550
Yeah. My brother is sick. I just went to see him.

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Is he alright?

133
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,760
Yes. Something is wrong with his heart,

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,640
but it's okay now.

135
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,230
Why are you here?

136
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
I just took something to Mr. Xia.

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,350
Shen Qing's son is also here.

138
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,590
Really?

139
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,150
Don't you know that?

140
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,760
Mr. Xia said

141
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,590
you saw Shen Qing get off here that evening.

142
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,150
Too many things have happened these days.
I can't remember.

143
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,400
Are you okay?

144
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,590
You look pale.

145
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,880
I'm okay.

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,590
Sorry. I didn't have time to send you a message.

147
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,840
Never mind. There is nothing important.

148
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,840
Well.

149
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,710
Just go home and have a good rest.

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,790
I'm going back to the office.

151
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,110
Bye.

152
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,320
Xing Yun.

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,710
Are you available tonight?

154
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's have dinner together.

155
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,550
Do you like to have some wine?

156
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,910
I'm good.

157
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,910
This one.

158
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,280
Thank you.

159
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,670
Okay.

160
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Chu Nan! It's a small world.

161
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,230
Who is she?

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
My girlfriend.

163
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,030
You know,

164
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,440
you have to help Chu Nan

165
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,550
get out of that bad relationship.

166
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,200
What are you talking about?

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
He's drunk. Sorry.

168
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,670
You're drunk. Let's go.

169
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,760
See you.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,760
Sorry.

171
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,080
What does he mean by a bad relationship?

172
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,030
Forget about it.

173
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,760
He's joking.

174
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,880
Why is dating more exhausting than working?

175
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,880
Miss, you forgot your stuff.

176
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,550
Thank you.

177
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,320
Mr. Xia, the driver is waiting for you downstairs.

178
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,910
You'll give a speech at 2:50 p.m.

179
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,400
You'll give another speech
before the dinner party starts.

180
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,880
As a special guest,

181
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
you can take one more person with you.

182
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,030
Who will you…

183
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,520
Xing Yun, come with me.

184
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,710
You're lucky.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,840
This is an annual forum for game developers.

186
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a rare chance. Go!

187
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,000
The so-called industry summit?

188
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,670
Exactly.

189
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,030
Hurry up. Follow Mr. Xia.

190
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,670
I'll send the agenda to you later.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,590
Okay!

192
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,290
(Mr. Xia's schedule)

193
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,290
(Special guest: Mr. Fuyu
The writer of many good-selling cartoons)

194
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,030
Mr. Xia, will we join the dinner party tonight?

195
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,550
Yeah. I'll make a speech.

196
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,440
What's up? Are you hungry?

197
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,910
No. I'm just checking.

198
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,470
Oh. Mr. Xia,

199
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,470
the agenda shows
that a lot of industry talents

200
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,000
will join the parallel sessions.

201
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,710
Parallel sessions?

202
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,840
I know you'll give a speech at the main venue.

203
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm asking for your permission.

204
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,280
Can I go to the parallel sessions?

205
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,470
I'll be back soon.

206
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,840
I just want to gather some information.

207
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,840
I hope I can do a good job on the project.

208
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,640
Go ahead.

209
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,840
Thank you, Mr. Xia!

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
Let's welcome Mr. Xia from TIG.

211
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,320
He'll talk about the latest industry trends.

212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Hi, everyone.

213
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,840
As the bellwether
of cultural and creative industries,

214
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,840
video games have been a pioneer

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,880
as for the integration of pan-entertainment sector.

216
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,000
The data analysis shows

217
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,960
60% of gamers are women.

218
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,840
How do you like it?

219
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,710
our VR games are not bad, right?

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
Actually, I don't think

221
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,590
VR technology is suitable

222
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,080
for shooting games at present.

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,400
It makes me very dizzy.

224
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
Miss, you don't understand.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,440
VR will become mainstream in the future.

226
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,470
All technical problems will be solved.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,230
You said it makes you feel dizzy.

228
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
Some extraordinary people in the industry

229
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,200
will solve the problem sooner or later.

230
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
What's most important

231
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,110
is to seize the initiative.

232
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,200
It'll be popularized

233
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,440
when omnidirectional treadmills get cheaper.

234
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,590
VR treadmills are a little like the Kinect.

235
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,960
It takes up too much space.

236
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,710
I remember it broke a Guinness world record

237
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,710
for the most sold electronic device in 2009.

238
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,790
But five years later,

239
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,150
it was discontinued

240
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,320
because of its high requirement for space

241
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,000
and weird operation.

242
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,640
You're a girl. You know nothing about it.

243
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,200
Which company do you work for?

244
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm from TIG.

245
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,590
Don't you focus on mobile games?

246
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,470
Stop making comments here.

247
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,230
Go away.

248
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,840
Miss.

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,640
I think you know a lot about gaming devices.

250
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,110
I'm flattered. I just love cartoons.

251
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,520
I learned all that from my boss.

252
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm Jeremy Yang from Huize. Nice to meet you.

253
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,710
Nice to meet you. I'm Xing Yun.

254
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
You said you work for TIG.

255
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
What do you do?

256
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,470
I used to be an original animation artist.

257
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,550
Now I'm a planner of Instance Zones.

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,760
TIG is the leader of the industry.

259
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,150
Oh. Are you available now?

260
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,880
Can we talk over coffee?

261
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm afraid not. Thanks.

262
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,440
I've drunk three cups.

263
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,550
How about juice?

264
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm good. Thank you.

265
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,840
Miss Xing.

266
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,440
You have a deep understanding
about the gaming industry.

267
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,200
And your job is meaningful.

268
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,590
You must be a valuable asset to the company.

269
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,590
I don't have a business card.

270
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,280
Just come to me if you want to get a new job.

271
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,670
Thank you, but I'm good.

272
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,400
We can also have business exchange.

273
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,910
It's okay.

274
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,710
Miss Xing.

275
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
Mr. Xia, what a coincidence!

276
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,670
I was going to the lounge to see you.

277
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,790
I want to thank you for joining the forum.

278
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,910
Thank you.

279
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,790
You gave a wonderful speech just now.

280
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,960
I just recited my speech draft.

281
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,670
The other two

282
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,400
did a better job.

283
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,710
Mr. Xia, you're humorous.

284
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,760
We just wanted to help them

285
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,640
avoid awkward silence.

286
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,710
I don't think it's necessary for me

287
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,470
to give a speech tonight.

288
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,320
No. Mr. Xia.

289
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,670
Just do it as a mere formality. Okay?

290
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,840
It won't take you much time.

291
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,840
If you don't do it,

292
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,080
I'll be scolded by my boss.

293
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,000
Tell them I don't feel well.

294
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,400
Mr. Xia.

295
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,200
Hold on. Mr. Xia.

296
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
We can have a talk about it.

297
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,280
All things have been arranged.

298
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,470
Mr. Xia.

299
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm very glad to meet you here

300
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,640
at the game industry forum.

301
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,440
Each of you present here

302
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,150
must be among the best of the industry.

303
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,670
Nowadays, the gaming industry keeps thriving,

304
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,440
which takes an extraordinary opportunity

305
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,080
to us and even the whole pan-entertainment sector.

306
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,150
You work for TIG?

307
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,550
I just heard the speech given by your boss

308
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,840
at the main venue.

309
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,320
He's so hot.

310
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,350
Do you work with him?

311
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,760
You're so lucky.

312
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,110
You'll get tired of something if you're exposed
to it too often, no matter how beautiful it is.

313
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,350
How could it happen?

314
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
He's cold-blooded and calculating.

315
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,760
Of course, he just looks cold-blooded.

316
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,800
Actually, he's very warm-hearted.

317
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,310
He treats us like his family.

318
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,190
That's the information you've gathered here?

319
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,400
Mr. Xia, I've drunk too much coffee.

320
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,280
I can't help talking nonsense.

321
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,760
Mr. Xia, can I have your autograph?

322
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,800
It can't help improve

323
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,950
the sales of your games.

324
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,110
Mr. Xia, are you going to get prepared
for the dinner party?

325
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,950
I want to join one more parallel session.

326
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,230
You don't need to wait for me.

327
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,880
It's cancelled. We're going back to the office.

328
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,430
What? Why?

329
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,160
Do you mean Mr. Fuyu, the author of "Haoda Team",

330
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,760
won't give a speech tonight?

331
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,070
I thought I'd have a chance to see him

332
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,040
in person.

333
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,710
I drank three cups of coffee

334
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,070
just to keep myself energetic

335
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,950
and memorize each word he says.

336
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,230
Why is it cancelled?

337
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,110
That's what makes you depressed?

338
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,590
Shen Qing.

339
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,710
Why are you back?

340
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,710
Xiaoxi can't stay in hospital alone, right?

341
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,350
It's okay.

342
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,230
The weather has been awful recently.

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,710
It's not easy to take a taxi.

344
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,590
Delivery has become more difficult, right?

345
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,880
It's not so bad.

346
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,640
Don't worry. Just take good care of your son.

347
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Don't lie to me.

348
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,590
Even deliverymen won't work on such bad days.

349
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,590
You'll have to do it yourselves.

350
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,640
And you don't have a car.

351
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,760
Well.

352
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll also do delivery these days.

353
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,800
You don't need to do that.

354
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,760
Mr. Chu has been helping us.

355
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,830
What?

356
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,590
Shen Qing, I know you've broken up.

357
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,800
I planned to say no at the very beginning,

358
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,280
but we've got so many orders.

359
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,590
As you know,

360
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,230
people usually order cakes to celebrate birthdays

361
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,040
or anniversaries.

362
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,230
If it's delivered late,

363
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
we'll not only be scolded by clients

364
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,280
but also receive complaints on the internet.

365
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,590
So…

366
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,680
Alright. It's not your fault.

367
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,920
Go. Let's work.

368
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,430
Hello? Amy.

369
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,070
Tell the sponsor I'm much better.

370
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,070
I'll give the speech tonight.

371
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh. Get one more seat

372
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,070
at the top table.

373
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Thank you again

374
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,230
for your support for "Infinite Unknown Love".

375
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,040
Next, let's welcome Mr. Fuyu.

376
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,280
Hi, everyone. I'm Jishin Fuyu.

377
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,470
It's a great honor to be here with you.

378
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,760
Many of my works

379
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,830
have been adapted to video games

380
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,400
and they are loved by you.

381
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,160
It makes me very happy.

382
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Mr. Fuyu!

383
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,520
I saw the legendary Jishin Fuyu.

384
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
And he's shaking hands with me.

385
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,310
He proves himself to be a great cartoonist.
I can feel the strength of his hand.

386
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm so happy!

387
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,520
Mr. Xia.

388
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,230
Shouldn't you be at the dinner party?

389
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,070
I asked you to wait for me at the top table.

390
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Why are you here?

391
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,800
I don't like that kind of occasion.

392
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Do you remember what happened last time?

393
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
A group of strangers sit together.

394
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,280
Instead of taking the dishes I like,

395
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,590
I have to look at them passing by.

396
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
It's kind of torture.

397
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,760
I prefer to stay here and make something do.

398
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,680
Go back.

399
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Now that it's more comfortable to stay here,

400
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,470
why do you ask me to go back?

401
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,230
Thank you.

402
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,070
I'll have the same.

403
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,040
Okay. Thank you.

404
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,920
Why are you looking at me like that?

405
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,470
Mr. Xia, I think

406
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,830
you're radiant tonight.

407
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
It's like every single hair is shining.

408
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,830
I've heard animals' eyes can
absorb different light sources

409
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,880
and reflect at night.

410
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,230
Do you think my eyes are particularly bright?

411
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,070
Idiot.

412
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,040
I'll enjoy my dinner.

413
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,280
Are you performing acrobatics?

414
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,590
I just shook hands with Mr. Fuyu.

415
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,520
I want to keep the lingering warmth longer.

416
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,400
I wiped my hand.

417
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,400
What are you doing?

418
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,040
You also shook hands with Mr. Fuyu, right?

419
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,310
Pass the lingering warmth to me.

420
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,640
Look at you!

421
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,040
Just for a second.

422
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,470
Aren't you Chu Nan's…

423
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,000
We met in the restaurant the other day.

424
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,280
Are you also here for the summit?

425
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,800
What a coincidence! It's you.

426
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,430
Don't worry. I won't tell Chu Nan about it.

427
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,160
We all want a little excitement occasionally.
I see.

428
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,760
You can also come to me if you're available.

429
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
Oh. You got me wrong.

430
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,000
He's my boss.

431
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,710
Right. Your boss.

432
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,950
You need to get well along with him, right?

433
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,430
Spend some time with me
when you're available. Okay?

434
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,110
What are you talking about?

435
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,110
Why can a person like you

436
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,470
join the summit?

437
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,470
Sorry? Can you repeat it?

438
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,640
I said, why can a person like you

439
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,680
join the summit?

440
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,590
You do not know who I am, right?

441
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,160
I'm the investor of the game.

442
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,040
No big deal.

443
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,070
Mr. Xia is the upstart of the gaming industry,

444
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,350
president of TIG.

445
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,710
So many people want to invest in our company.

446
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,280
You have to wait in a long queue to see him.

447
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Your mind is so dirty.

448
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,280
How could Chu Nan have a friend like you?

449
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,430
My mind is dirty?

450
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,350
You were touching your boss' hand.

451
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,160
I did it to get the lingering warmth of Mr. Fuyu.

452
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,680
Chu Nan will understand.

453
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Pervert!

454
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,470
Pervert?

455
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm not. He's just a freak.

456
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,520
So, you went out for a date the other day,

457
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
but you told me you'd go to work overtime.

458
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,470
I just had dinner with him.

459
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,800
Then I went back to the office.

460
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,680
Do you really like Chu Nan so much?

461
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,590
His brother is sick.

462
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
I think he's been in low spirits recently.

463
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,280
His brother?

464
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,280
He said it's a heart disease.

465
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,160
His brother is also at Chaoxin Hospital.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,350
I think it's serious.

467
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,760
He didn't say too much about it.

468
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh. Mr. Xia.

469
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,880
If your brother is sick,

470
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,430
what can your girlfriend do

471
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,470
to make you feel better?

472
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,710
If it were my brother,

473
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,160
I'd ask my girlfriend to see him.

474
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,760
Mr. Xia, thank you very much.

475
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
You let me see Mr. Fuyu in person.

476
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,470
It's true that something good will happen

477
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,470
as long as you live positively.

478
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm leaving.

479
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,190
Mr. Xia, bye.

480
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,760
Sorry. I came back too late.

481
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,430
It's okay. Xiaoxi is a good boy.

482
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,310
Do you know who took it here?

483
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,310
Nobody else but Chu Nan.

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,190
Alright. Eat!

485
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,400
It's late.

486
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,430
You couldn't get food
from the dining hall of the hospital.

487
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
The weather is terrible.

488
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,520
No parking is allowed downstairs.

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,640
I saw him wrap the porridge and dim sums

490
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,070
in his clothes.

491
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,950
Is it still hot?

492
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,760
He just left. I'm afraid he'll get caught in the rain.

493
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,040
You're stupid.

494
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
Why don't you take an umbrella on such a bad day?

495
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,430
You're off duty.

496
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,950
Are you here just to pick me up?

497
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I don't think so.

498
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,640
You came here every day.

499
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,110
Did Xing Yun complain about it?

500
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,680
She's the daughter-in-law I want.

501
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,400
Don't let her down.

502
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,310
Mom.

503
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,310
Xiaoxi is a pitiful child.

504
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,880
Life is not easy for his mom.

505
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,710
If it were somebody else,

506
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,000
I might give her a hand
after knowing all about this.

507
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,350
But you're my son.

508
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,710
She's divorced and she has a kid.

509
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,950
You even haven't entered a relationship.

510
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,310
I won't let you marry her.

511
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,070
Okay.

512
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,560
Wait!

513
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Sir, shouldn't it be a dining room?

514
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,520
It's No. 88, Shixing Avenue, right?

515
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,590
Yeah. That's right.

516
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,160
That's it.

517
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,000
Hi, Mr. Chu.

518
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,710
This way, please.

519
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,430
Chu Nan!

520
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,400
Aren't we going to have a meal?

521
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,680
Try them on before we go.

522
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,560
Try on wedding dresses?

523
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,520
It's said that

524
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,680
girls will want to get married

525
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,110
when they put on wedding gowns.

526
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,520
Actually, the shop belongs to one of my friends.

527
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,830
He asked me to take you here

528
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,160
and then give them some suggestions.

529
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,800
Don't feel pressured.

530
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,640
How could I feel no pressure?

531
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,800
Chu Nan has been acting weirdly
since we came back from the resort.

532
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,350
I'm telling you.

533
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,350
Man is most likely to think too much
when he's vulnerable.

534
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,590
He either wants to

535
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,950
change something of no importance

536
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,190
or change his own behaviors.

537
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,520
Actually, in the final analysis,

538
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,920
he wants to change the current situation.

539
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,160
Forget about it. Let's go back.

540
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,830
Wait. I'll try them on.

541
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,310
It's your friend's shop, right?

542
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,310
But I'll just try them on.

543
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,040
Okay.

544
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,680
Miss Xing.

545
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
These wedding gowns

546
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,280
are most suitable for you.

547
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,950
You can have a look.

548
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,190
I'll leave her to you.

549
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,160
So many styles.

550
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,160
Right. There are A-line and fishtail

551
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,520
as well as princess style wedding dresses.

552
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Which one do you like?

553
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,950
This is a hand-tailored one with crystals.

554
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,400
It's expensive,

555
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,830
but you can rent it.

556
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,760
In this way,

557
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,110
you'll also have a perfect wedding.

558
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,280
I'll try this on.

559
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,110
It's suitable for you, too.

560
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,830
It's simple and elegant. I'll get it for you.

561
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,640
The dinner party is very important for us.

562
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,710
Trust me. I'll try my best.

563
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,280
I trust you.

564
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,760
I'm leaving.

565
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,590
Okay.

566
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,430
Take care.

567
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,400
See you.

568
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,830
He took the ring in the drawer, right?

569
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,350
He didn't lie.

570
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,430
He said he'd go propose today

571
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,760
and he did.

572
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,230
She's beautiful in it, right?

573
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,160
It's like she's from a fairy tale.

574
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,110
Even I want to get married.

575
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,680
How do you like it?

576
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,110
How do you feel about wearing
a wedding gown for the first time?

577
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm not used to it.

578
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,710
I feel like I'm a walking umbrella.

579
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,230
Xiaoxi, where is your mom?

580
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,560
My mom has gone to work.

581
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,000
Xia Ke, my car doesn't work.

582
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,590
Is it out of power?

583
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,880
Let me get a new battery.

584
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,590
Xiaoxi, is it your mom's?

585
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
It's vitamin.

586
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,590
My mom takes it every evening.

587
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,920
She takes several pills.

588
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,920
Xia Ke, come and pick me up.

589
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,160
8777.

590
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,680
Mr. Xia.

591
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,430
Chu Nan.

592
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,350
Hello? Chu Nan.

593
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,590
What on earth is on your mind?

594
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,470
You know what?

595
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,710
Shen Qing has to take many sleeping pills

596
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,230
to fall asleep.

597
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,350
You have to make a decision now.

598
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,950
If you choose Xing Yun,

599
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,160
then never show up in front of Shen Qing.

600
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,560
If you choose Shen Qing,

601
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,280
come to Sanhuang Hotel immediately!

602
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,430
Do it now!

603
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,080
Sorry.

604
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,630
I asked her a few questions.

605
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,710
Mr. Xia said

606
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,150
Shen Qing has to take many sleeping pills

607
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,280
to fall asleep.

608
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,360
She's drunk a lot at Sanhuang Hotel.

609
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,670
He asked you to make a decision.

610
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,520
Where is she?

611
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
Sanhuang Hotel.

612
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,760
Shen Qing.

613
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,870
I've drunk too much.

614
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,470
Xia Ke, I even mistook you for Chu Nan.

615
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,670
Why did you drink so much?

616
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,040
You even sound like him.

617
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,710
Did it go well with your proposal?

618
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:33,910
No.

619
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,710
Why not?

620
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,280
She's simple and naive.

621
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,910
Actually, I'm very happy

622
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,390
to see you be together.

623
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,230
But I like a woman with terrible character.

624
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,630
See? You finally tell the truth.

625
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,150
You think I have terrible character.

626
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,000
Why hasn't Xia Ke shown up?

627
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,430
He said he'd take care of me.

628
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,950
Mom. Please come and help her son.

629
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,280
Please!

630
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,120
Why are you here?

631
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,000
That's the end of

632
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,670
my first love.

633
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,870
Xing Yun, it's not your first love.

634
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,670
You knew it,

635
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,280
right?

636
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,760
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,190
Calm down.

638
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,840
Calm down?

639
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,760
Right.

640
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,800
I'd understand if I stay calm.

641
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,000
You didn't want me to go on a blind date.

642
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,950
You didn't want me to go to Chu Nan's home.

643
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,840
He left ahead of time when we were at the resort.

644
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,760
He did it again when we were in the wedding shop.

645
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,280
You did all these

646
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,600
for the sake of your sister, right?

647
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,360
Xing Yun, I…

648
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,670
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

649
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,390
You did it.

650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,760
They're back together.

651
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,470
Thanks to you,

652
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,390
I'm standing here,

653
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,520
seeing the end of my relationship

654
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,430
on such a bad day.

655
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,630
I just don't want you to get hurt.

656
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,520
Are you worried about me?

657
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,280
What do you think I am?

658
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,040
Your pet or mascot?

659
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,280
You're just used to taking advantage of me.

660
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,230
You don't have the right to decide my life.

661
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,430
I can explain. Get on.

662
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,670
Let go of me!

663
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,320
Xing Yun, get on,

664
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,600
or you'll lose your monthly bonus.

665
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,910
I don't care.

666
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
I don't want the bonus for this month

667
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,800
and for the next month.

668
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,470
You know how much it costs
to repair the car, right?

669
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,630
Just deduct it from my salaries.

670
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,040
I don't want to see you again.

671
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,230
I think we are a good match.

672
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,190
I want to go further, can I?

673
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,280
Do you know each other or not?

674
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,320
No.

675
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,430
Mom, I won't marry Xing Yun.

676
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,630
What?

677
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,430
I'm here to tell you the truth.

678
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,120
I went on a blind date

679
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,600
just to be with Shen Qing.

680
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,710
You dislike her because she's divorced,

681
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,840
so I planned to marry Xing Yun and then divorce her.

682
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,470
Then I'll be divorced, too.

683
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,470
You're so mean.

684
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,190
You win.

685
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,360
Not too bad. It's alright.

686
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,600
Mr. Xia, as for the follow-up procedure,

687
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,280
I'll let He Yu take care of it.

688
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,520
It happens

689
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,190
you've known each other for years.

690
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,630
I believe the cooperation between Jiawo and TIG

691
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,630
will go smoothly.

692
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,630
Definitely.

693
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,360
Okay. I'll leave you alone.

694
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,470
He's bad at golf, but you even let him win.

695
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,360
You don't need to do that for me.

696
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,670
Or are you really not yourself today?

697
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,520
Where is your mascot?

698
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,280
Why is she not here?

699
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,760
You usually take her everywhere.

700
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,320
She didn't answer the phone. She's crossed in love.

701
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,150
Crossed in love?

702
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,040
You did make them break up.

703
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,190
For the sake of Shen Qing?

704
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,150
It has nothing to do with me.

705
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,560
Chu Nan, let's break up.

706
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,470
Xing Yun, I'm sorry.

707
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,120
Actually, I've never stopped criticizing myself

708
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,630
when I'm with you.

709
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm very sorry

710
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,120
to get you hurt.

711
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,470
I'm telling you.

712
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,760
I think he's just your teammate

713
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,600
instead of a boyfriend.

714
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,360
Your task is to enter a relationship.

715
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,600
I suddenly remember someone told me

716
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,230
you're just my teammate

717
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,360
instead of a boyfriend.

718
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,600
Our task is to enter a relationship.

719
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,470
It seems he's right.

720
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,280
I don't know why,

721
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,950
but I feel much relieved

722
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,360
after I said we should break up.

723
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,600
Maybe we have misunderstood

724
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,430
the true meaning of "being in a relationship".

725
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,840
Maybe

726
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,230
I shouldn't call it a relationship.

727
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,120
I must go.
