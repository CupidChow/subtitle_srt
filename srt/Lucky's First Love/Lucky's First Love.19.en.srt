=Lucky's First Love=

2
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,620
=Episode 19=

3
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,280
You said I had acousma.

4
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,220
Really, there is someone knocking
at the door.

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,020
Xing, Xing.

6
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,540
Look.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,340
What are you…

8
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,960
I did hear someone knocking at the door.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,820
Where is it?

10
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,380
I've told you

11
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,460
you have acousma.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,420
Do I?

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,880
You are getting old with hearing loss.

14
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,460
Yeah.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,340
I'm getting old.

16
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,220
Come to have meals.

17
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,820
Well.

18
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
What are you doing?

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Come to have meals.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
I'm coming.

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,820
That was your mother.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,380
You live next door, right?

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,820
So you must hide yourself very well.

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
My mother has known that you are my boss,

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,460
living here temporarily.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,980
Luckily, my father hasn't known it yet.

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,180
If my father knows it…

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,620
So make sure not to
let my father discover anything.

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,700
Why?

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,100
If my father knows I…

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
If he knows Aunt Wang leaves,

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
he will be very sad.

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,780
Anyhow, if my father knocks at the door,

34
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,740
you mustn't open it.

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
If you run across him on the corridor,

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,620
just pretend that you are just passing here.

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,060
Anyhow, don't enter the house when he is aside.

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,060
Don't worry.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,060
My father usually goes out very early

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,780
and comes back early.

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,240
Except weekend, you're less likely
to run across him.

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,020
It won't affect your daily life.

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,980
What does your father look like?

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,700
I'll show you!

45
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,780
By the way,

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,660
send the photo to me.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,020
Can you remember someone the first time
you see him or her?

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,540
Done!

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,980
Sit down!

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,580
Have a seat.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,320
I know you usually don't like having breakfast.

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
Just a cup of coffee can help
you spend the whole morning.

53
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,020
But it's a special period for TIG,

54
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,460
you must have good health.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
The fried sticks of Mr. Zhang's
are crispy outside and soft inside.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,820
You can't buy them without standing
in a line for at least 15 minutes.

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,940
As for the fried sticks,

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,500
you must dip them in the tofu pudding.

59
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,460
They're very tasty. You know?

60
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm almost watering.

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,540
Have a taste.

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,340
Taste it!

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,500
Is it delicious?

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,940
I eat them every day.

65
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,600
Let me have some.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,700
That's it.

67
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,020
Oh, my God!

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,820
What's wrong?

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,660
Miss Yao is dating with Li Xia.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,260
Look.

71
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,360
When Miss Yao required
to go to another team, she said

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,620
she was familiar with someone in team X.

73
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,660
Maybe it is Li Xia.

74
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,740
Probably.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,760
Impossible!

76
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,360
How could it be impossible?

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
When did you see Miss Yao

78
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,960
have dinner with someone?

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,380
Having been back for so long,

80
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,660
except the man in TIG,

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
she hasn't had dinner with any others.

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,480
Does Miss Yao want to find a boyfriend?

83
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,700
Big news!

84
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,180
Do you think so?

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,240
Mr. He,

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,980
Miss Yao and you are college schoolmates.

87
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
Do you know what kind of person she likes?

88
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,780
It's not someone like you anyway.

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,880
It's not like you.

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,840
I find

91
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
they are quite interested
in starting up a business.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,960
Xi.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Xia.

94
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,620
Xia Ke.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,300
Why are you here?

96
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,860
I brought him here.

97
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
You can have a chat.
I'm going to have a meal with someone.

98
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,160
Hearing TIG is going to close down,

99
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm afraid my brother will be out of work.

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,040
So I come here to comfort you.

101
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,080
It's not suitable to play jokes in the company.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,980
Please go back.

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,300
No need to worry. There aren't other people here.

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,540
Except you two

105
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,300
who are hardworking here,

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,380
the others have gone to have meals.

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,740
Excuse me, you four come here, right?

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,420
A private room, please.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,860
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,340
There's no private room left.

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,580
With so many people here,

112
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,740
do you think it's not suitable for us?

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,900
Wait for a moment. I'll go to ask

114
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,220
if another room can be arranged for you.

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,440
Behave well, ok?

116
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,540
Just a while.

117
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,220
No.

118
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,960
Just a while, please.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,780
Xi,

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,740
don't bother him anymore.

121
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,000
How about learning to make paper folding from me?

122
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
Ok. Paper folding.

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,100
As long as you are busy,
you even forget to have meals.

124
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm afraid you're hungry and faint in the CEO office

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,660
without being known by others. So I come here.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,960
But seemingly, there is someone knowing that.

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,020
Did she resume her post?

128
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,500
Then I'll be relieved.

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,620
Now there are someone urging you
to have three meals every day.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,740
Yeah.

131
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,940
This morning, I was forced to

132
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,320
have some fried sticks with tofu pudding.

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
What? You had tofu pudding?

134
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,980
You always think

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,980
tofu pudding is as disgusting as some vomit.

136
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,580
I can do nothing but eat them.

137
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,220
Someone sent them to me and blocked the door.

138
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,540
Mr. Xia, are you thirsty?

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,780
It's nothing.

140
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
Aunt Wang, who lives
next to Xing Yun's family,

141
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,980
has gone abroad.

142
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,020
Her only requirement is that

143
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,220
I should clean the room

144
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
and hand in the fees of water,
electricity and properties.

145
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,780
Is there such a good thing?

146
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,220
Yeah. And what a coincidence is that

147
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,240
the decoration style of

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
Aunt Wang's family

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,100
is the same with that of mine.

150
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,660
Even her furniture is put

151
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,220
in the same place as ours.

152
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,540
Mr. Xia, you have the same taste

153
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,200
with a 60-year-old aunt.

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,540
Is it worth mentioning it everywhere?

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,760
So you're together now, right?

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,900
Not yet.

157
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,540
Yet?

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,380
I mean

159
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,020
the main task is

160
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,220
to save TIG.

161
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,260
I don't have time to put my heart
into other things.

162
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,880
The reason why I took Mr. Xia to live
in Aunt Wang's house is mainly that

163
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,620
I didn't think it was convenient for him
to live in the company.

164
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,020
You lived in the company?

165
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,420
It's just a quick decision.

166
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,980
Why are you so hesitant?

167
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,940
She used to follow my pace.

168
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,160
This time,

169
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,940
I want to follow hers.

170
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,020
What's wrong?

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,340
It's nothing.

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
I just think

173
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,180
you've changed a lot.

174
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,380
So Shen Qing

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
didn't know you had sold your house, right?

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,980
Amy!

177
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Even if Amy hopes to come back,

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,540
I'm wondering if Mr. Xia will agree.

179
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,340
After all, a deserter
during the hard times of the company

180
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,260
has lost her feelings of it.

181
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,920
She is out.

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
How is it going?

183
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,820
Dear friends, I'm back.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,220
You scared me.

185
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,920
Didn't Mr. Xia ask you

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,980
why you were willing
to give up the double pay?

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,740
He didn't care.

188
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,900
He just said

189
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,460
I was welcome to TIG at any time.

190
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,620
He is so cool!

191
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,140
I know,

192
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,100
as a deserter,

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,060
I must get some punishment.

194
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,300
I'll treat you tonight

195
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,460
and tell you

196
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,740
how terrible the outside world is!

197
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,300
Mr. Xia, Amy said she would treat us tonight.

198
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,800
Would you like to go with us?

199
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,180
No, I…

200
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,860
Mr. Xia, we can take this chance

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,020
to have a get-together

202
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,920
to relax and cheer ourselves on!

203
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,480
Mr. He, what's up?

204
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,740
I think we need to have a talk.

205
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,340
I'm sorry. I have made an appointment with a client.

206
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,860
We can talk over phone.

207
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Do you love me?

208
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,660
I, I, I...

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
Why do you always follow me
since you don't love me?

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,660
Will you say that

211
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
you haven't realized

212
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
you love me

213
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
until that night? Suddenly you are awake.

214
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,440
I

215
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,820
No, I just want to…

216
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
When the enemy advances,
you retreat, vice versa.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,800
When you're fed up with it, you just withdraw.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Is it you?

219
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,140
Get out!

220
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,960
I …I haven't finished my words.

221
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,460
Everybody,

222
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,580
let's raise our glasses

223
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,000
to welcome Amy for her coming back.

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,100
Cheers!

225
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,200
Cheers! Cheers!

226
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,380
Enjoy more! It's on me.

227
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,980
Ok.

228
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,940
Let's eat.

229
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,740
Amy, tell us

230
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,180
what the world outside TIG is like.

231
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,400
Let's begin.

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,360
The first black hole of the outside workplace:

233
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,160
mysterious smell of men.

234
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,740
You know, in a game company,

235
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,200
just a few have a balance of the number

236
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,260
of male and female workers.

237
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,060
Most game companies are crowded with homebodies.

238
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,180
The air quality is very bad,

239
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,500
dropping sharply from morning to night.

240
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,220
I haven't finished.

241
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,040
The second black hole of the outside workplace:

242
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,120
cannon fodder of the competition of different teams.

243
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,980
Not until I went out did I know that

244
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,340
what a harmonious

245
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,520
and kind family we TIG is!

246
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,540
Maybe you don't believe that

247
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,340
some people even depend on the number
of the reservation of the meeting room

248
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
to show their capability.

249
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,000
Why didn't you reserve the meeting room
more than others?

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,980
What did you do?

251
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,780
The most terrible is the boss's groping hands.

252
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Being in a pigpen,

253
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,140
how could you avoid the pig hoofs?

254
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,940
Hello, chief.

255
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,420
Yes.

256
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,620
The most important is that
there isn't another boss

257
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,880
as handsome as Mr. Xia.

258
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,360
Isn't it?

259
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,060
Mr. Xia, to be honest,

260
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,940
if it were you,

261
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,780
I would like to accept it.

262
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,300
Mr. Xia, just satisfy her.

263
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,380
I came here as soon as I graduated.

264
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,500
Unexpectedly, the outside world is so terrible.

265
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,660
Compared with that,

266
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,780
TIG is really a good place for us
to devote ourselves to developing games.

267
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,340
Mr. Xia, since I left,

268
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,420
I missed the fragrance of ebony
from Acqua di Parma perfume

269
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,480
on your body.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Mr. Xia, why does it

271
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,360
smell like shampoo?

272
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Shampoo?

273
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,380
Amy, stop your anthomaniac.

274
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,980
Drink three cups of wine as a forfeit.

275
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,800
After this resign, I came to know

276
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,860
TIG is the right place for me.

277
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,200
It can be taken as an exploration
of the outside workplace.

278
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,940
You should thank me!

279
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,860
Don't drink a toast to me.

280
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,920
Let's toast to TIG and Mr. Xia.

281
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,700
Cheers!

282
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,420
Cheers! Cheers!

283
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,240
Ok, I got it.

284
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
Unexpectedly,

285
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,700
Since Xing Yun came back,

286
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,420
the company has been running better.

287
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,940
Everyone is full of energy.

288
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,780
It's disappointing to tell you news,

289
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,000
but it's true that VC Investment just refused us.

290
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,740
As expected!

291
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,180
When I was looking for other investors,

292
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,840
I found an interesting option

293
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
which you may be interested in.

294
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,140
Well, Xing Yun.

295
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,300
Tell us the reason why you came back.

296
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,740
Is it difficult to be Mrs. He?

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,660
We're broken up.

298
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,220
Break up?

299
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,180
I thought he was serious this time.

300
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,860
He deserves to be a playboy
with only 3 minutes' enthusiasm.

301
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,700
Is it because he has a new sweetheart?

302
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,760
What're you thinking? We broke up peacefully.

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,620
it's over.

304
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,460
Well, stop the topic.

305
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,320
It's a good day today.

306
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,220
To celebrate our get-together

307
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,180
and TIG'S

308
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,060
reliable investor to be found,

309
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,740
let's cheer!

310
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,340
Come on, cheers!

311
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,180
Cheers!

312
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,140
What are you laughing at?

313
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,220
It's nothing.

314
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,700
I just heard your roaring.

315
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
This morning, I doubted if I had a hearing loss.

316
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,380
It seems that I still hear very clearly.

317
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,340
Dad, close the door quickly.

318
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,980
There are too many mosquitoes.

319
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,460
Ok. Ok.

320
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,620
I want to drink icy Cola.

321
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,300
Here you are.

322
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,300
My daughter, what do you want to have
for tomorrow's breakfast?

323
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,540
Fresh shrimps porridge, abalone porridge,

324
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,300
seafood porridge or egg and pork porridge,

325
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,940
which one do you like best?

326
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
There is no need to be so complicated.

327
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,120
It's not for you.

328
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,820
It's for him, your boss.

329
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Mum, why do you care for him so much?

330
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,180
Listen.

331
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,420
I saw him this morning.

332
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,780
He is very good-looking

333
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,300
with a handsome face.

334
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,220
He is also tall.

335
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,620
Really a good choice!

336
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,300
Did you tell him that you love him?

337
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,100
What was his reaction?

338
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,820
Did he feel that?

339
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,220
If not, how could he live here?

340
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Mum, what are you saying?

341
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,980
He is my boss.

342
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,420
The company is in great trouble.

343
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,100
Who can mention this in such a crucial period?

344
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,860
Listen to me.

345
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,240
This kind of man is very popular nowadays.

346
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,040
Take  actions quickly.

347
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,460
I support you!

348
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,100
What to support?

349
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,900
It's nothing.

350
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,280
You act secretively.

351
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,380
Can you share it with me?

352
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,900
My daughter?

353
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
What to share?

354
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,620
Dear.

355
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,420
I just asked our daughter

356
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,500
to water the flowers on the shelves in the balcony.

357
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,080
They are drying to death.

358
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,240
Hurry up.

359
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,800
Ok.

360
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,820
Quickly.

361
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,860
Don't waste time.

362
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,840
You can share with me.

363
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,060
Come here.

364
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,980
What to do?

365
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,420
Prepare for tomorrow's breakfast.

366
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,840
Use the best rice.

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
Mr. Xia.

368
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,340
I nearly forget

369
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,220
our balcony

370
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,380
is close to Aunt Wang's.

371
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,500
I really miss the time

372
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,860
when Daqiang and I

373
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,240
climbed up the balcony to play with each other.

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,240
Daqiang?

375
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,940
He is Aunt Wang's son, three years older than me.

376
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,100
Unexpectedly, you have such a

377
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,940
childhood sweetheart.

378
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,060
However, since he graduated from primary school,

379
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,620
he hasn't appeared in the balcony any more.

380
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,460
Why?

381
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,980
I don't know.

382
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
Maybe, in the junior school,

383
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,540
there are much more interesting things than

384
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,340
the balcony and the girl next-door.

385
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,720
I think it's very interesting.

386
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,500
I used to think that

387
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,220
it's romantic to have so close balconies.

388
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,300
actually,

389
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,660
it's very cold in winter with piercing winds.

390
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,840
It's so cold that my nose may run.

391
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
In summer, there are many mosquitoes.

392
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,820
Look at you! You don't know the tricks.

393
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,460
Being in the balcony, you must

394
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,420
behave like me, moving all over.

395
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,940
Why don't you tell me earlier?

396
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,220
You were stung?

397
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,580
Do you need floral water?

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,180
Well. Forget it.

399
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,540
It's better for you to stand it.

400
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,140
Otherwise Amy must feel surprised that

401
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,240
her elegant and tasteful

402
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,080
boss who has all series
of the Acqua di Parma perfume

403
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
could have the smell of washing powder
and floral water on his body.

404
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
You don't like the smell, right?

405
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,300
How could it be?

406
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,140
I think this is the taste of family.

407
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,820
Anyhow, in the balcony,

408
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,780
you have running nose in winter
and itching body in summer.

409
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,040
There isn't any romance.

410
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,620
Show me your hand.

411
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,580
Hey！

412
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,700
Don't move! Saliva is the most antipruritic.

413
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,900
Let me mark a cross on your hand.

414
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,780
No need.

415
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,780
Mr. Xia,

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,220
as for the investor that Director Wang and you

417
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,460
have found,

418
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,080
what's the result?

419
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,160
Why do you suddenly ask me this question?

420
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,060
It was said that you failed again.

421
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Good news never goes beyond the gate,

422
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
while bad news spreads far and wide.

423
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,420
Don't worry.

424
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,860
I also have some alternatives.

425
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,520
I have to go to work for the Instance Zones.

426
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,880
Next time, they must beg us to invest for them.

427
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,320
Hey!

428
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,600
What's up?

429
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,240
I will also work over time.

430
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,540
Anyhow we need to work over time,

431
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,380
what about working together?

432
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,940
Listen to me. The new version of the Instance Zones

433
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,060
has many problems.

434
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,420
If we work together,

435
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,340
it's better for us to communicate with each other.

436
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,820
Yunyun, have you finished watering the flowers?

437
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,860
It's such a long time.

438
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,460
There are too many mosquitoes outside.

439
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,040
Come in quickly.

440
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,540
(Progress for Instance Zones)

441
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,780
Have more.

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Really, I'm not lying.

443
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,900
No.

444
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,980
What about this?

445
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,360
This one is also good.

446
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,180
Mom.

447
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,960
This one.

448
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,660
It's enough.

449
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,500
This one.

450
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,420
Have more.

451
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,860
Take the chicken claws.

452
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
Look at here. I think this one is ok.

453
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,100
Take more.

454
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,460
Take the bigger ones.

455
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
This one. Take them.

456
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
This one and this one.

457
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,580
This one.

458
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,900
Mr. Li asked me to his house

459
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,780
and wants to tell me something.

460
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,940
Enjoy your meal. I'll be back soon.

461
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,620
Hurry up.

462
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,380
Ok.

463
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,180
Take this one. It's very delicious.

464
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,780
It's enough.

465
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm leaving, mum.

466
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,180
Ok, hurry up.

467
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,980
Come in.

468
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,220
You…

469
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,100
Go.

470
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,460
Is this the planning case you've made?

471
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,360
(Go to a concert together. Play Lego together.
Go to the ferris wheel together.)

472
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,300
I think the first several are good.

473
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,280
The ferris wheel is a little common.

474
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,580
We have thought it over that

475
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,940
we can't only pursue novelty.

476
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,900
After all, the dating part

477
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,060
should give people

478
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,220
a feeling of love.

479
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,340
What about you?

480
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,220
Do you have the feeling of love?

481
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,260
If you’re not satisfied with the scenes,

482
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,780
I can communicate with those in charge of documents

483
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,820
to pay attention to the details about

484
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,900
how to innovate.

485
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,340
You haven't answered my questions yet.

486
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,540
Mr. Xia, I've told you many times that

487
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,500
in TIG'S present situation,

488
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,920
I don't have time to fall in love.

489
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,260
I've 	told you

490
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
I can deal with the things of the company.

491
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,680
Because all the things

492
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,500
will finally become good.

493
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,060
If not,

494
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,280
it's not the end.

495
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,140
Just like the stray cat,

496
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,420
although it was deserted,

497
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,780
it met you.

498
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,060
Although it was hurt,

499
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,340
you cured it.

500
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,380
You make me believe that TIG is the same.

501
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,620
With ups and downs,

502
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,780
it's bound to have a happy ending.

503
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,380
You were the man that day, right?

504
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,920
I met you in the pet shop by chance.

505
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,480
I met you in the talent market

506
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
by chance, too.

507
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,120
I don't want to

508
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,080
maintain our relationship by chance anymore.

509
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,860
I remember someone told me that

510
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,740
being rich and handsome could also be annoying.

511
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,460
I doubt

512
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,300
whether you show sympathy to me

513
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,800
or you are used to me.

514
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,060
I… I just hope

515
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,240
you can get the investment money successfully

516
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,260
and keep your insistence

517
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,060
without any fears and considerations.

518
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,820
Maybe I'm not very capable.

519
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,380
I don't know much about the operation of the company.

520
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,020
I just hope to help you more.

521
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,060
There is one thing I'm sure.

522
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,340
As long as you need me,

523
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,020
I will stay in the company all the time.

524
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,860
So we can talk about it later.

525
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,580
I will always be there. But money isn't.

526
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,040
What if I am not always there?

527
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,080
Uh?

528
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,620
In other words,

529
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,980
what if I meet another woman,

530
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,760
marry her and have children?

531
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,780
Then why should I stay in the company?

532
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,900
Help you raise children?

533
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,940
In the past,

534
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,020
I just followed your pace.

535
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,360
But I don't want to wait anymore.

536
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,300
I just think

537
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,300
the present condition is also good.

538
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,740
Give me a reasonable

539
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,020
identity to stay with you!

540
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,700
I know how to serve a boss.

541
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,620
But how to get along with my boyfriend,

542
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,740
I don't have enough experience.

543
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,060
Maybe I can't do well.

544
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,100
Then let's make a promise.

545
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,900
What about studying together

546
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,140
to explore it?

547
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,500
Of course I've decided to

548
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,540
follow your pace.

549
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,800
If you haven't prepared well, I can wait.

550
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Long time has passed.

551
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,600
I…

552
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,240
Ok.

553
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,320
Don't be angry anymore.

554
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,500
The boy has good conditions.

555
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,560
He is good looking and talented with achievements.

556
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,480
Your daughter is not young anymore.

557
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,200
It's normal for her to fall in love.

558
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,640
Besides,

559
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,300
it's not easy to find such a good boy.

560
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,660
Don't bother them.

561
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,760
How could you say such words?

562
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,440
I didn't bother.

563
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,120
Do you know how many men

564
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,560
are like tigers and wolves?

565
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,620
You say he is good-looking and talented.

566
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,540
How could you say?

567
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,980
I think he is like a telegraph pole.

568
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,100
Do you think Chu Nan is good-looking and talented?

569
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,180
What happened in the end?

570
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,640
How?

571
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,260
He is different from Chu Nan.

572
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,200
Don't compare them with each other.

573
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,540
Besides,

574
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,300
if your daughter doesn't marry

575
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,820
and lives with us all her life,
are you satisfied?

576
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,480
Yes, I am.

577
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,260
Bah! You're really boring!

578
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,500
Listen, you're ill.

579
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,340
You're afraid of being a father-in-law.

580
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,060
Do you know?

581
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,040
Your heart is filled with jealousy.

582
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,060
You are jealous

583
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,460
of the young man.

584
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,260
I am jealous?

585
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,500
I'm jealous of him?

586
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,620
Need I?

587
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,420
I'm upholding the justice. Do you know?

588
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,440
Come on!

589
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,940
Is there any man

590
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,260
asking a woman to rent a house for him?

591
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,100
Doesn't he feel ashamed?

592
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,580
It sounds shameful!

593
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,500
Shameless!

594
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,740
Renting a house or not

595
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,540
is up to your daughter.

596
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,660
Just let her deal with it by herself.

597
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,060
No.

598
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,320
What are you going to do?

599
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,420
Knock again?

600
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,700
You can go to open the door.

601
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,660
I'm going to have a look.

602
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,420
Wait.

603
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,880
Shen Qing.

604
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,940
Hello.

605
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,620
Xiaoxi.

606
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,720
Don't take them.

607
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,100
I'm not feeling well.

608
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,060
I will make myself drunk.

609
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,140
Otherwise I can't fall asleep.

610
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,860
Put them where they are.

611
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,740
Put them where they are.

612
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,140
Honey.

613
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,780
I will comfort your broken heart.

614
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,620
Follow me.

615
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,260
What are you going to do?

616
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,280
Will you make yourself drunk?

617
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,060
Why do you come?

618
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,340
Of course we're here to see you!

619
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,140
It's not a suitable time.

620
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
Tell me

621
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,340
what you were doing before we came.

622
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,760
How could you ask me this question before Xiaoxi?

623
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,460
Mr. Xia.

624
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,860
Xiaoxi, tell your father

625
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,840
he fails.

626
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,340
Great!

627
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,580
Xia Ke and Xing Yun are together!

628
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,060
What's your bet with Chu Nan?

629
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,140
We made a bet that after how many times 
of several take-outs,

630
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,920
you will be together.

631
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,180
Boring.

632
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,280
With such good news,

633
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,000
what about calling friends
to have a celebration

634
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
to comfort

635
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,940
us onlookers who always expect them
to be together?

636
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,760
I will ask Chu Nan to take several good wine.

637
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,220
Now?

638
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,260
It's never too late to celebrate for good things.

639
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,020
And tomorrow is the weekend.
You don't need to go to work.

640
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,700
Let me think who I will call.

641
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,260
Oh, my God!

642
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,300
Remember it?

643
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,020
Remember?

644
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,500
It's great. I'm so happy.

645
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,700
You have hidden it so secretly.

646
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,940
Of course.

647
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,020
When we were in Spain,

648
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,140
you didn't allow me to buy it.

649
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,700
Expensive！

650
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,340
I spent half the money of a lipstick

651
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,700
buying it for you.

652
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,620
Thank you, honey! Thank you!

653
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,220
I have a demand.

654
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,180
After drinking it,

655
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,140
don't look at your watch every five minutes,

656
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,060
asking where your daughter is

657
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,180
and why she hasn't been back.

658
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,960
Don't think of someone else's wife.

659
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm your wife. Clear?

660
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,740
I love you till death. Darling!

661
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
Let's go to enjoy the wine.

662
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,100
Yeah!

663
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,140
I will buy you a lipstick tomorrow.

664
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,560
Coming to send my best wishes at mid-night,

665
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,180
I am moved by my generosity.

666
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,700
Where is your gift?

667
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,940
That's more like it!

668
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,220
For the sake that you are my brother,

669
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,300
I ‘d like you to have Xing Yun.

670
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,620
But you must cherish her.

671
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,660
Don't let down my kindness and generosity.

672
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,660
Later…

673
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,260
That's right. Xing Yun,
you should also cherish him.

674
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,780
Don't let down my quit.

675
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,920
Yao Qing.

676
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,020
Ok.

677
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,880
You just make quite slow progress in your relationship

678
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,220
with me, your rival in love
becoming your matchmaker.

679
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm always expecting

680
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,620
when you can have a happy ending.

681
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,820
Finally I can release the load on my mind.

682
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,740
Why are you here?

683
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,580
Maybe in Shen Qing's opinion,

684
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,900
I have done something significant
to make them together. Without me here,

685
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,980
she wouldn't feel comfortable.

686
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,500
Yes, you're right.

687
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:16,960
You must come!

688
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,300
Clearly, you only refuse to answer my phone.

689
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,060
The wine is ready!

690
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,180
Chu Nan, Xiaoxi.

691
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,980
We're coming.

692
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,380
Before eating, let's drink

693
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,020
to bless them.

694
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,260
Come on! Cheers!

695
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,440
Cheers!

696
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,060
Cheers!

697
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,460
Me, too. Me, too.

698
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,500
Cheers! Xiaoxi.

699
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,700
Xiaoxi.

700
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,800
You can empty it. I will sip.

701
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,860
Do you know what it's like

702
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,540
when loving someone seriously?

703
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,460
I will pursue him confidently

704
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,300
without begging him shamelessly,

705
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,160
let alone forcing him by any kind of means.

706
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,580
If he loves someone else,

707
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,700
I will only wish them happiness.

708
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,440
Enjoy the dishes!

709
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,820
Xiaoxi.

710
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Enjoy the dishes!

711
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,980
Xiaoxi, you must be hungry.

712
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,920
Yes.

713
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,060
How delicious!

714
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,660
Enjoy it.

715
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,820
Chopsticks.

716
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,260
Taste it, Xiaoxi.

717
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,040
Dad.

718
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,400
There is one minute before 12 o'clock.

719
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,860
If you didn't come back,

720
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,140
I would go to knock at the neighbor's door.

721
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,260
Now you can rest assured.

722
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,140
Go to sleep.

723
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,180
Hurry up to sleep.

724
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,740
Go to bed!

725
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,000
Good night!

726
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,160
You handsome boy in white,

727
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
it's really hard to catch up with you.

728
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,620
You slack off again!

729
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,940
You ask me, an idiot of sports to run with you.

730
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,500
Of course I have to come up with a way.

731
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,220
Here you are!

732
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,100
Be careful!

733
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
What are you going to do tomorrow?

734
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,860
Are you asking me as my boss

735
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,120
or my boyfriend?

736
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
Is there a difference?

737
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,980
Of course.

738
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,620
Boyfriend.

739
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,800
I have made plans with Yiyi
to go shopping with her.

740
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,700
It seems that the flexible working schedule

741
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,540
makes you learn to slack off.

742
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,620
See?

743
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,740
You behave as a boss again!

744
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,060
The work pace of the program is slow these days.

745
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,580
As long as you find an investor,

746
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,460
we're sure to work with full energy
and strength without slacking off.

747
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,160
What's your plan tomorrow?

748
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,920
I will go to see Mr. Qin of Tiange Investment.

749
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,020
Don't change the topic.

750
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,080
Where are you going shopping?

751
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,160
Sunshine Shopping Center.

752
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,200
Help me buy a tie.

753
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,340
Any problem?

754
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,260
No problem. What kind do you like?

755
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,820
I will buy one for you.

756
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,440
I love what you love.

757
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,840
Lazy you! It's your turn.

758
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,500
Wait for me!

759
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,100
I can't run because I just had finished breakfast.

760
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,340
According to the recent two years'

761
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,860
white book of the global mobile games industry,

762
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,320
female players are increasing

763
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,800
by 50.2% every year,

764
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,880
which has surpassed the number of male players.

765
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
It suggests that the time of female players is coming.

766
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,080
It will be a huge market.

767
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,360
We are very confident
about the new version of Infinite

768
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
and the Instance Zones which is to put online.

769
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,900
Mr. Xia, after this meeting,

770
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm interested in your company

771
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,680
and

772
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,160
the games

773
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,660
you are developing.

774
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,020
Looking forward to your cooperation.

775
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,860
As for the detailed information,

776
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,540
I have to ask Mr. Qin for instructions.

777
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,900
Before meeting Mr. Qin,

778
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,320
I won't start the cooperation hastily, either.

779
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,700
After all, we haven't reached an agreement on

780
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,580
our thoughts.

781
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,440
Yes.

782
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,520
As long as Mr. Qin goes back,

783
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,440
I will contact you immediately.

784
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:55,960
Thank you!!

785
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,600
Thank you!

786
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,780
Thank you!

787
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I'm going to call you.

788
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,220
Your performance of homelessness

789
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,500
is so real!

790
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,100
When did you change the password?

791
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,020
Why are you here?

792
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,600
0805. What do they mean?

793
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,540
I'm so kind to ask

794
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,540
an hourly-employee

795
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,900
to help you clean the house.

796
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,960
You even didn't say thanks to me!

797
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,340
It's dark.

798
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,380
Aren't you eager to go back to spend

799
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,000
the sweet life of almost living
together with Xing Yun?

800
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,540
She went out for something.

801
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,780
By the way,

802
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,220
I have a question.

803
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,100
Recently, she always goes shopping

804
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,180
without buying anything.

805
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,140
Why?

806
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,620
Are you over pretending that you live miserably?

807
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,420
What do you mean?

808
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,780
It's not cheap

809
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,220
to raise a young master.

810
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,880
How could she have enough money to go shopping?

811
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,340
Thank you for your hard work today.

812
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,220
You've worked the whole day.

813
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,020
I should be apologetic.

814
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,380
There is something wrong with my family.

815
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,740
I'm sorry to ask you to see me here so far away.

816
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,540
It doesn't matter.

817
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,140
It's the rush hour now. There may be traffic jams.

818
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,100
Where are you going later?

819
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,780
I

820
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,140
Gosh! My tie…

821
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,100
I'm leaving.

822
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,220
I'm going to the Sunshine Shopping Center.

823
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,460
You need to go through half of the city
to get there.

824
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,620
You can reach there about one to two hours later.

825
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,260
I know. So I must leave now.

826
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:35,980
Bye-bye.

827
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,180
Be careful!

828
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,600
What a coincidence!

829
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,500
Xing Yun.

830
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,780
Hello, Shen Qing.

831
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,380
Are you busy now?

832
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,900
I want to ask you for a favor.

833
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,900
I'm listening.

834
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,180
Xia Ke asked me to buy him a tie.

835
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,660
I want you to come up with an idea for me.

836
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,460
Take a picture of the ties in the shop.

837
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,700
I haven't arrived at the shop.

838
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,780
It's a long distance.

839
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
I'll be there at about 10 o' clock.

840
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,100
I'm afraid Xiaoxi is asleep then.

841
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,980
So I call you now.

842
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,180
Sir, go to Sunshine Shopping Center.

843
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,820
It's so late.

844
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,500
Why not buy it next time?

845
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,780
With his strong pride,

846
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,420
I don't think it is easy for him
to ask me to buy it.

847
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,860
It's better for me to go there now.

848
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,060
Sir, hurry up, please.

849
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,620
I don't have enough time.

850
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,260
Ok, I'll send his favorite colors and styles

851
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,800
to you.

852
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,300
You really don't know how to behave properly.

853
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,540
How could you ask a girl

854
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,940
to buy you a tie at night?

855
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,660
What are those in your drawer?

856
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,500
Red scarves?

857
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,380
She really thinks

858
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,060
you are too poor to buy a tie.

859
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,080
So she carefully cares for your pride.

860
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,060
I just want to feel her out

861
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,580
if she really went shopping.

862
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,420
Feel her out?

863
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
My child,

864
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,420
do you really have occupational disease
of being a CEO?

865
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,140
Look, it's so late now.

866
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,900
How dangerous it is for a girl to be outside!

867
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,900
And according to the weather forecast,

868
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,920
it's going to rain tonight.

869
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,380
It's certain she didn't take an umbrella.

870
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,200
You… Are you going to find her?

871
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,860
Go away!

872
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,260
Mr. Xia, how could you be here?

873
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,460
What time is it?

874
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,740
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,100
I forgot the time while shopping.

876
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,700
But I have bought a tie.

877
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,700
Take it.

878
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,060
If you don't want to wear wet shoes,

879
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,900
just come to my back.

880
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,120
It's not convenient to park here.

881
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,100
So I parked in the parking lot near the street.

882
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,480
Why are you laughing?

883
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,780
The first time you took me on your back,

884
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,920
it was on the way to the golf course.

885
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,640
I wore the same clothes that day.

886
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,920
Yeah.

887
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,400
You said

888
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,640
you hated the capitalist like me most!

889
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,300
Being a miserable capitalist now,

890
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,900
you are much cuter.

891
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,980
Do you expect me to be so miserable all the time?

892
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,000
Of course not!

893
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,820
You used to be almighty

894
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,020
and invulnerable.

895
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,900
It seems that you don't need anybody.

896
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,020
While now…

897
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,500
Sorry.

898
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,700
What are you sorry for?

899
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,560
I used to think that I was always right

900
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,380
and that I could decide and solve all the things.

901
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,940
I didn't consider the feelings of others,

902
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,840
which actually hurt them.

903
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,000
I will change myself.

904
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,540
This is the first time
that I have heard your self-criticism.

905
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,900
Really being a girlfriend

906
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,020
is different from being an employee.

907
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,460
There're always many differences.

908
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,540
After figuring them out,

909
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,220
write a report to me.
