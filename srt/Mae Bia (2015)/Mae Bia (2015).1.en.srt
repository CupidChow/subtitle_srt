1
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,297
IN THE CAGE

2
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:24,114
BANGKOK 9.30 AM

3
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,089
Hello.

4
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,264
Mekhala's speaking.

5
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,604
Good morning, Mae.

6
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,322
Don't recognize my voice?

7
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,547
How could I not recognize
a charming boy like you?

8
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,133
Am I right, Pakbhumi?

9
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,019
Want to have dinner with me tonight?

10
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:31,840
How about tomorrow night?

11
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:36,092
I am going to Singapore with my boss
tomorrow and get back on Saturday night.

12
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,033
How about Sunday night?

13
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,772
Definitely not on Sunday, Pakbhumi.

14
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,514
I'm a guide for a cultural trip

15
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:44,431
in Bang Plama, my hometown.

16
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,144
-That's perfect.
-How so?

17
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:52,872
My boss, Chanachol, is looking for
a traditional Thai house.

18
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:57,106
I've been searching many places
but he's still not happy.

19
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:01,597
If he likes your place,
you might get about...

20
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:05,981
30 to 40 million Baht. How about that?

21
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:14,564
Sorry, I will never sell my house
to anyone.

22
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:20,872
I'm just kidding.
You are the only person I know

23
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,972
who can give him
some good advice on old houses.

24
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:29,731
Confirm the date with my secretary.
I gotta go now. See you then.

25
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,929
Okay, fine.

26
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:37,456
I'll take Chanachol on that trip
to your place on Sunday.

27
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,456
Good morning.

28
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,056
Good morning, Pakbhumi.

29
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,222
Good morning.

30
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,697
Right.

31
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,422
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

32
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:08,456
-Morning.
-Morning.

33
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:13,589
The Oriental Marina project has been
approved by the Australians.

34
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:16,881
Mr. Johnson will be joining our meeting.

35
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:21,064
-Good morning, Dad. Hi, Chanachol.
-Bhumi.

36
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,131
Mr. Johnson will give you
his confirmation

37
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:25,831
on the date of his arrival to Phuket.

38
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,356
Yes, dad.

39
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,731
Have you found an old Thai house
for him yet?

40
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,172
I think I found it.

41
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:33,547
Where is it?

42
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:35,939
In Bang Plama, Suphan Buri.

43
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,239
It's Mae's house.

44
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:40,639
That's good. Well, I gotta go.

45
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,247
Yes, Uncle Dirake.

46
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:54,806
The house's owner is gorgeous.

47
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:09,339
A cage.

48
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,989
We are all prisoners in an invisible cage.

49
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:16,585
Can we find our freedom?

50
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,831
Nobody knows the answer.

51
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:20,981
But for me,

52
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:24,589
being the owner of a traditional,
old Thai house

53
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:28,139
might be the answer
that I've been looking for.

54
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:46,622
AT THE OLD HOUSE

55
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:48,564
That's the reason...

56
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,780
BANG PLAMA, SUPHAN BURI - 3 PM

57
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,506
...why I'm cruising along the Suphan river

58
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:55,031
on the day after
my business trip to Singapore,

59
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:59,364
and despite always feeling nervous
on boats.

60
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,681
Now we're cruising along Ta Chin river.

61
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,939
Locals call it Suphan river.

62
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:12,414
People make a living by cultivating
fish and shrimp farms in Bang Plama.

63
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:16,322
The tape-grasses over there are edible.

64
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:21,964
This cultural trip might be
a new thing for Chanachol.

65
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:24,756
You have such a pretty name.

66
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,481
Have you ever been drowned?

67
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:30,881
Please give him a round of applause.
He's a new member of our group.

68
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:38,981
Are you thinking of your
billion-dollar joint venture?

69
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:42,839
Nice. You still have some free time
to join our trip.

70
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:48,406
The traditional Thai house over there
is our destination.

71
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,464
We keep everything just as it was
in the past.

72
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,506
This boat is like a time machine

73
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:57,364
that will bring you back in time

74
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:58,939
to a hundred years ago.

75
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:03,756
Please turn off your mobile phones
when we get off the boat. Thanks.

76
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,547
Just like when the plane
is taking off.

77
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:21,614
Do you like it?

78
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:23,827
It's interesting.

79
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,622
Mae is the owner of this house.
It will be easy.

80
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:30,031
-Welcome, Chanachol.
-Thank you.

81
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,489
We've prepared
some traditional Thai snacks.

82
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,906
These fish dumplings are truly exquisite
examples of Thai cuisine.

83
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,456
My grandmother used to work in the palace.

84
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:44,989
Bengal quince juice for your refreshment

85
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,139
served as hot or iced tea
for your selection.

86
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:51,147
Have you ever tried it, Chanachol?

87
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:53,947
Never.

88
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:06,630
Then...

89
00:12:06,714 --> 00:12:09,814
Mekhala...

90
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,697
the gorgeous...

91
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:15,622
goddess...

92
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:17,616
Excuse me.

93
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:24,614
...seduces Ramasun...

94
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:27,156
the giant god of thunder...

95
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,672
by waving a crystal ball

96
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,689
The crystal ball...

97
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:18,639
The main hall in the middle
is the original and the oldest one.

98
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,106
That's my great grandfather
in the largest picture frame.

99
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,056
These ladies sitting in line

100
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,056
are my great grandmothers.

101
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,014
This is a photo of my mom

102
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,097
and my dad.

103
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,547
Men in the past
lived privileged lives

104
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,197
Right, Chanachol?

105
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:37,531
They did.

106
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,081
If you like native plants,

107
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:43,147
we have a lot of them growing
at the hill in the backyard.

108
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:44,714
They have been here for ages.

109
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,147
Please.

110
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:51,002
Not today, I guess.

111
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,102
Why not, Uncle Tim?

112
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:57,694
I saw a snake.

113
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,456
You have no luck today, guys.

114
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,981
I really don't like snakes.

115
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:09,064
But I'd love to.

116
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,656
Boossaba and Ek will take you all
to see the rest of our garden.

117
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:19,147
I will take Chanachol
to the hill in the backyard.

118
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,914
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

119
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,556
Do you actually
dress like this everyday?

120
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:42,202
Not everyday.

121
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,939
Just occasionally.

122
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,264
Rumor has it,

123
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:49,047
people say that

124
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:50,681
I'm not in my right mind.

125
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,522
I've heard that
you love old houses.

126
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,089
-Do you like this house?
-I do.

127
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:00,147
What's that flower?

128
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,747
It's called a peep flower.
You probably wouldn't know it.

129
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,681
It smells nice but unusual.

130
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:16,556
We have lots of different native plants
growing on this hill.

131
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,489
Those are nom maew flowers.

132
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:24,364
They're used in making desserts.
Those are purple wreath

133
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:25,689
and sarapi flowers.

134
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:30,060
Do you know any of them?

135
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:32,739
I've heard their names
in Thai literature.

136
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,106
Do you read Thai literature?

137
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,972
My mom made me read it
every summer when I was in England.

138
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:44,556
Perhaps my mom didn't want her son
becoming too westernized.

139
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:48,022
She loved Thai culture.

140
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:55,460
I hope that

141
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:58,185
I can learn about Thai culture

142
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,160
from you.

143
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,514
Everyone is ready to leave.

144
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,447
I say goodbye to you right here.

145
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:10,172
What if I want to contact you?

146
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,314
You can do it with Pakbhumi.

147
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:16,039
-I will give you a call.
-Right.

148
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,914
Nice to meet you,

149
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:20,510
Chanachol.

150
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:22,706
Until we meet again.

151
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,214
You.

152
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:17,956
Are you here?

153
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,156
Why are you here?

154
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,031
Phot

155
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,227
How did you know that I'm home?

156
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,089
Your voice on the boat was so loud.
Anyone could hear you.

157
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,464
Mae, I bought this for you
from Ayutthaya.

158
00:20:59,056 --> 00:20:59,927
Thanks.

159
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,522
Let's talk outside, Phot.

160
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:16,077
What are you doing?

161
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:18,839
Sexually assaulting me?

162
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:29,197
Take off your clothes.

163
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,547
You want to do it

164
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:31,822
or should I?

165
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,964
I love it when you do it for me.

166
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:48,864
The snake!

167
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:49,939
The snake!

168
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:52,597
The snake!

169
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,314
The snake!

170
00:22:58,621 --> 00:22:59,693
What type of snake, Uncle Tim?

171
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:01,106
A cobra.

172
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:14,214
Why are you so obsessed
with that snake, Mae?

173
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,539
Phot

174
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:30,331
I'm going to Bangkok.

175
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:32,297
Can you give me a ride?

176
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:39,539
Yeah.

177
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:02,855
CHANACHOL MANSION
BANGKOK - 10 PM

178
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,281
Back in the cage again.

179
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:08,794
Am I a prisoner in my own house?

180
00:24:10,597 --> 00:24:11,769
Do you like Mae's house?

181
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:13,569
Later.

182
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:15,672
-Let's see Kaew.
-Okay.

183
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,397
Daddy's home with Uncle Bhumi.

184
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,105
-Hi, Petch.
-How's my little girl?

185
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,864
-Hello, Uncle Bhumi.
-Why aren't you in bed?

186
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,322
-I'm about to.
-Good girl. Let me kiss you.

187
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,797
-Go to bed.
-Good night, Daddy and Uncle Bhumi.

188
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:35,439
-Good night.
-Good night, sleep tight.

189
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,739
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

190
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:42,885
Hi, Kaew.

191
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:45,839
-You're back.
-What about you?

192
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:47,597
I went to Frank's diamond showcase.

193
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:49,872
Want a drink, Pakbhumi?

194
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,189
No, thanks.

195
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:54,331
I just wanted to say hi to you
and then call it a day.

196
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:55,722
Do you have plans?

197
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,539
I'm going to a party in Thonglor.

198
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,681
So I gotta go.

199
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:02,747
Good night, bro.

200
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:04,189
Good night, Kaew.

201
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:05,331
Right.

202
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:15,189
How's the old house in Suphan Buri?

203
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,089
Do you like it?

204
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,056
I do.

205
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,072
But the owner will say no.

206
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:24,064
Did you negotiate with the owner?

207
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:26,956
Not yet.

208
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:28,447
Thanks.

209
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,772
What's that flower?

210
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:35,219
It smells so nice.

211
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:38,548
It's called a peep flower.

212
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:57,839
MEKHALA'S HOUSE, BANGKOK 11 PM

213
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:58,814
Mae.

214
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:00,714
What?

215
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:02,660
That stupid snake...

216
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,022
Can I send my guys to kill it?

217
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,477
I'm so sick of it.

218
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:10,072
Leave her alone.

219
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:11,877
I'm begging you.

220
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:27,168
12 AM

221
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,072
You had a nightmare again?

222
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,214
THE MYSTERIOUS LADY

223
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:23,714
1.30 PM

224
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:36,872
I give up, Pakbhumi.
I could hardly sleep last night.

225
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,289
I had a blast last night.

226
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:45,864
What are you thinking about the house?
Should I invite Mae for dinner?

227
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:53,839
You're free tonight and tomorrow night.

228
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:56,272
John arrives in Phuket
the day after tomorrow.

229
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:58,214
We'll have a long meeting on Sunday.

230
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,281
Our customers want a cultural trip
to England in December.

231
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,839
They want to visit museums
in London during the day,

232
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,189
and go to West End theaters at night.

233
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:16,064
This is what you specialize in.

234
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:18,706
Of course. I will do everything I can
to make this the perfect trip.

235
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:25,772
I need a break, guys.

236
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,614
Hello. Good morning, Mae.

237
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:33,589
What's up, my lovely boy?

238
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:38,106
Chanachol'd like to invite you
to have dinner with him tonight.

239
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:40,606
What if I'm not available?

240
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:45,647
You should be. A millionaire
wants to treat you to dinner.

241
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:49,969
Chanachol lets you pick the place
you'd like to have dinner at.

242
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,289
I should be the one
who buys your boss dinner.

243
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:55,464
I don't want anyone's charity.

244
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:58,697
At my place. Just tell your boss

245
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,222
Mekhala would like to invite him
to have dinner.

246
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,114
I'm the chef.

247
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:06,456
If he can bring a couple of bottles
of expensive wine,

248
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:07,764
I would be grateful.

249
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:10,256
Is that all right?

250
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:15,014
Okay, see you.

251
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,489
Pakbhumi.

252
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,806
Is Mekhala married?

253
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:39,347
She probably never will be.

254
00:29:41,256 --> 00:29:42,152
Why not?

255
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,039
You'll know why when you know her.

256
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:02,631
7 PM

257
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:22,522
After you.

258
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,081
These are for you.

259
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,110
Thank you.

260
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:35,827
Please come in, Chanachol.

261
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:38,789
No need to say that to Pakbhumi.
He visits this place quite often.

262
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:40,772
I'll put the wine in your pantry.

263
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:43,144
Fine. Make yourself at home,
Chanachol.

264
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:44,847
A single girl's place is a mess.

265
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:48,319
Please take a seat.

266
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:49,781
What would you like to drink?

267
00:30:50,272 --> 00:30:52,122
Chanachol always prefers
whisky on the rocks.

268
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,114
A man after my own heart.

269
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,352
You like whisky too?

270
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,047
Are you surprised?

271
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:02,439
Mae could finish that whole bottle.

272
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:04,822
Really?

273
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,356
If you saw how my friends and I
used to drink in college,

274
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:09,831
you would be shocked.

275
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:13,964
Pakbhumi, can you get me
a glass of wine, please.

276
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:16,014
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:19,181
Were they getting wasted?

278
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,831
-Of course they were.
-It depends...

279
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,014
on your definition of "wasted".

280
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:27,964
If they're still conscious
and can see things around them,

281
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:30,731
they're not totally wasted, right?

282
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:32,572
You have a point.

283
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:37,389
Wait.

284
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:39,581
You're not getting a drink,
Pakbhumi?

285
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:44,389
I already have plans tonight.
I just brought my boss here.

286
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,310
Where are you going, Pakbhumi?

287
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:48,364
I have a meeting at 8 PM.

288
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:49,889
Really?

289
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:51,656
Indeed.

290
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:53,047
Please take care of my boss.

291
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:54,797
I'm leaving now.

292
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,414
Good night.

293
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:57,731
Good night, bro.

294
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:15,022
Then there were two of us...

295
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,510
Does that frighten you?

296
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,322
Why would I be frightened?

297
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:23,085
Me, of course.

298
00:32:27,222 --> 00:32:29,272
I should be scared of myself.

299
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:30,839
How so?

300
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:35,781
I don't always know what to do

301
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,764
when I'm with a stranger.

302
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:45,956
I can now reveal that...

303
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,263
CHU THAI PARTY, SUPHAN BURI - 8 PM

304
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:49,289
...for the upcoming election,

305
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:51,256
my son, Phot,

306
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:55,281
has confirmed his intention to run
as candidate for the Chu Thai Party.

307
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:57,556
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

308
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:59,364
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

309
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:01,172
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

310
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,389
I would prefer to be by a river

311
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,327
than the sea,

312
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:07,094
the mountains

313
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:08,914
or a creek in the woods.

314
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,181
Why?

315
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:17,389
I love the repetitive movement

316
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,531
of a river.

317
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:23,377
Makes me feel warm and cozy.

318
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:25,069
I think

319
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,489
that rivers are alive.

320
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:27,956
They have spirits.

321
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,614
That's quite a strange belief to hold.

322
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,731
“Strange” like me, right?

323
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:37,997
PHOT
Excuse me.

324
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:40,722
Please.

325
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:44,919
Hello.

326
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,556
Can I see you tonight?

327
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,214
How about tomorrow night?

328
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,056
I have a guest tonight.

329
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,019
Who's that? A woman or a man?

330
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,119
That's a secret.

331
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:57,194
See you tomorrow night, Phot.

332
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:59,131
Right, tomorrow night it is.

333
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:15,518
-Chai.
-Yes.

334
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:17,972
You go to Mekhala's house
and kill that snake.

335
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:22,094
People says it's a mystical serpent.

336
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:25,356
Nobody dares to go to that house
at night, young master.

337
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,006
There's no such thing, you idiot.

338
00:34:28,472 --> 00:34:29,314
Go.

339
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:30,935
You kill it tonight.

340
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,410
Yes, young master.

341
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:43,956
Did you make a reservation
in Phuket for John?

342
00:34:44,056 --> 00:34:46,731
-I'll be there tonight.
-Thanks a lot.

343
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,297
10.15 PM

344
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:49,344
Pan,

345
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,289
follow me
to the president's office.

346
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:53,322
Yes, Pakbhumi.

347
00:34:57,722 --> 00:35:00,397
About buying an old Thai house,

348
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:03,081
have you made up your mind yet?

349
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:04,897
There are some old Thai houses

350
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,397
located on the riverside
near my place.

351
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:12,547
I can take you
to meet the houses' owners.

352
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:16,977
Do you want to try that?

353
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:18,872
You might find one you like.

354
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:23,164
Fine, if it's not too much bother.

355
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,410
How about tomorrow?
I have no plans.

356
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:33,614
Where's that stupid snake?

357
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,406
I think it's here.

358
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,231
It's a girl.

359
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:55,322
You're right.

360
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:56,964
I see what you see.

361
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,577
Be careful.

362
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:01,763
Is that a girl or a ghost?

363
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:05,514
How could a ghost
have such lovely boobs?

364
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:47,339
I can't stand it.

365
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:49,214
I really can't stand it.

366
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,381
No need to hide, girl.

367
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,481
Pol.

368
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:22,335
You go ahead.

369
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:23,639
Sure.

370
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,322
Where is she?

371
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,939
Go away!

372
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,352
Help me!

373
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:34,594
I'm so clumsy tonight.

374
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,172
-Let me help you.
-No, don't. Ouch!

375
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:40,239
Can I see it?

376
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,931
It's just a small cut. It's all right.

377
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:28,889
Your phone is ringing,

378
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:30,072
Chanachol.

379
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:39,397
Yes, dear.

380
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,056
Petch has a fever
and she's been throwing up.

381
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:43,647
I called Doctor Krit.

382
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:46,331
-He's here. Hi, Doctor.
-Good evening.

383
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:47,631
-This way.
-Yes.

384
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:50,605
-What are her symptoms?
-She keeps vomiting.

385
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:52,497
I have no idea
what's wrong with her, doctor.

386
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:53,647
You should hurry.

387
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:55,864
I'm on my way right now.

388
00:40:57,614 --> 00:40:58,514
Mae,

389
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,847
I really have to go.

390
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:02,581
What's wrong?

391
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:03,910
My daughter is sick.

392
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,447
You should leave.

393
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,635
Don't worry.

394
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:12,835
I'm so sorry.

395
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:15,714
We all have duties to carry out.

396
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:16,872
I understand.

397
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:19,706
This is my business card.

398
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:26,539
I'll give you a call then.

399
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:28,597
Yes.

400
00:41:53,797 --> 00:41:57,056
-Phot, I'm free tonight.
-Okay, I'll be there right away.

401
00:41:59,131 --> 00:42:01,372
Hi, my little tiger.

402
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,214
You're not going to bed?

403
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:04,764
I wanted to see you, Dad.

404
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,206
Good. Now you can stay up late.
We'll be able to go clubbing soon.

405
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:10,081
Not a good idea.

406
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,922
I'm going back to Bangkok tonight.
Where are you staying for the night?

407
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:17,917
We better stay here.
I don't want to travel tonight.

408
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:20,014
-Yes, mom.
-Let's go.

409
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,744
Let's go.

410
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:23,894
Let's go.

411
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,872
11 PM

412
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,206
She's sleeping.

413
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,897
What have I done?

414
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:52,256
Become an adulterer?

415
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,806
That's crazy.

416
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,297
I'll stay with her tonight.

417
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:07,022
Me too.

418
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:06,947
THE SERPENT

419
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:08,672
That's a relief.

420
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:10,781
She just had food poisoning.

421
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:13,197
Let her rest for a day

422
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,289
and she'll be back to normal by tomorrow.

423
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:17,497
-Thank you, Krit.
-That's all right, bro.

424
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:19,072
She's getting better.

425
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,456
I'm leaving now.

426
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:22,706
Why do I want to see her so badly?

427
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,514
I want her,

428
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:27,814
or do I want her house?

429
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:34,481
10 AM

430
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:35,456
Oh.

431
00:44:35,894 --> 00:44:37,497
How's your daughter, Chanachol?

432
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:40,064
She had food poisoning,
but she's getting better.

433
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:43,497
Did you forget about our appointment?

434
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:45,822
How could I forget that?

435
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:50,356
Can I pick you up at your place?

436
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:52,372
Let's meet in Bang Plama.

437
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:55,181
I'll send a boat to pick you up
at the pier.

438
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:57,472
You remember the route?

439
00:44:58,369 --> 00:44:59,297
I do.

440
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:02,889
Let's meet around 11. See you.

441
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:04,535
See you.

442
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,277
Hello.

443
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:11,597
What?

444
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,189
Damn it.

445
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:15,210
He was ordained?

446
00:45:19,514 --> 00:45:20,789
Right. Okay.

447
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,906
Fine. I'll be there.

448
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:27,464
Want some coffee, Phot?

449
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:31,106
No, I'm going to my office
and then to Bang Plama.

450
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,114
I gotta go.

451
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,489
Pakbhumi

452
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:39,481
I won't be in my office today.
Petch is sick.

453
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:41,706
You can attend the meeting for me.

454
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:43,139
Call me if you need anything.

455
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:45,656
Okay, boss.

456
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:48,256
About your dinner last night,

457
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:49,339
how was it?

458
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,206
Petch was sick so I had to leave.

459
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:55,939
You poor thing.

460
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,756
Don't worry about the meeting.
I'll take care of it.

461
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:04,206
Hope your daughter gets well soon.

462
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:06,139
All right.

463
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:07,677
Bye.

464
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:15,706
Chanachol isn't coming?

465
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:17,164
He can't make it, dad.

466
00:46:18,097 --> 00:46:19,972
-Where is he?
-His daughter is sick.

467
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:22,214
I see.

468
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,389
Good for you.

469
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:27,606
I know, Dad.

470
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:40,452
Ponthip.

471
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:42,589
Come to the president's office.

472
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,256
11 AM

473
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:15,264
What's going on, Uncle Tim?

474
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,464
Phot's men...

475
00:47:19,156 --> 00:47:20,631
They were killed by snakebites

476
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:22,247
and fell into the water.

477
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,214
They just found their bodies.

478
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:52,306
Hey.

479
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:54,097
You're so afraid of that snake

480
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:55,664
you had to hide away here?

481
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,939
It's really a ghost serpent.

482
00:48:06,472 --> 00:48:07,672
Ghosts are not real.

483
00:48:08,156 --> 00:48:09,856
Are you sure that you're not drunk?

484
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:12,114
I saw you were pretty tipsy at the party.

485
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:16,156
-You're lucky to be alive.
-What?

486
00:48:17,472 --> 00:48:20,339
I guess I'll have to kill
that fucking snake myself.

487
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:23,089
Watch your language, sir.

488
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:25,077
No need to say the "F" word.

489
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:29,364
See? She's coming.

490
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,889
Hey!

491
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,647
Sir!

492
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,372
You

493
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:54,089
You killed them?

494
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:57,306
Why did you kill them?

495
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:12,314
12 AM

496
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:14,781
What's in your cigarette?
It smells wonderful.

497
00:49:16,197 --> 00:49:18,322
It's made from dried peep flowers.

498
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,389
They can be used as tobacco?

499
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:25,697
Sure.

500
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:28,189
Please take a seat.

501
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:29,506
Thank you.

502
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:42,772
Have we met before?

503
00:49:48,706 --> 00:49:51,881
Make yourself at home.
Mekhala will be here in a minute.

504
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,097
Right.

505
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:34,514
Welcome back, Chanachol.

506
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,406
I wish I could be a local here.

507
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,606
Why?

508
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,131
Like home is where the heart is?

509
00:50:46,531 --> 00:50:47,506
It's not like that.

510
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:50,431
I think this place is so peaceful.

511
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,014
I've never felt like this.

512
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,172
When I'm in Bangkok,

513
00:50:57,772 --> 00:50:59,272
the city makes me stressed.

514
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,297
It's different for me.

515
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:03,872
I'm lively

516
00:51:04,597 --> 00:51:06,697
and active when I'm in Bangkok.

517
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:08,547
This place is indeed peaceful.

518
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:13,081
I love them both, I really do.

519
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,189
Lucky you.

520
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:22,056
Chanachol, watch out!

521
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,589
The water is not that deep.
You can stand up.

522
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:50,889
You're not drowning. Don't be scared.

523
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,439
Are you all right?

524
00:51:54,464 --> 00:51:56,414
It's okay. We're all right.

525
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,689
Do you like wearing a sarong?

526
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:17,939
I like it.

527
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,964
It's oddly comfortable.

528
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:24,364
You'll get used to it.

529
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,339
Uncle,

530
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:28,789
all my cigarettes are soaked.

531
00:52:29,844 --> 00:52:32,564
Can I try one of yours?

532
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:34,414
Sure.

533
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:39,389
Thank you.

534
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,635
So you have to use
Uncle Tim's cigarettes.

535
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:48,822
Do you want a new packet?

536
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,997
I could get someone
to pick one up for you.

537
00:52:53,052 --> 00:52:53,997
Don't bother.

538
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:57,247
I like these cigarettes.

539
00:52:57,947 --> 00:52:58,847
They smell really nice.

540
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,106
I can't believe

541
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:02,706
that you can't swim.

542
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:05,631
Your name means "defeating the water".

543
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,331
My dad told me that

544
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:12,514
when I was young,

545
00:53:13,927 --> 00:53:15,130
I was about two or three years old,

546
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:17,089
I almost drowned.

547
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:20,414
So my parents changed my name
from Pinit to Chanachol

548
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:22,839
for good luck.

549
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:25,922
So,

550
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,397
we couldn't see
any old Thai houses.

551
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:30,331
We can do it in the evening.

552
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,772
I don't think so.

553
00:53:34,094 --> 00:53:36,922
Why not? Scared of a boat ride?

554
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,981
No, I'm not.

555
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,439
I just now feel like

556
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:53,156
I don't want to buy any Thai houses.

557
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:55,516
When I came here,

558
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:59,472
you might think that I'm crazy but

559
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,097
I've always wanted to be here.

560
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,106
I want to sit right here

561
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:09,047
as long as I can.

562
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,406
It's so peaceful.

563
00:54:17,772 --> 00:54:18,697
You know,

564
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:22,214
I want to lie down right here.

565
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:27,797
-I couldn't sleep last night.
-Please do.

566
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:30,706
Make yourself at home.

567
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,497
-Get a good sleep.
-Yes.

568
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,281
I will imagine

569
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,756
that this house belongs to me.

570
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:20,589
I want to see daddy!

571
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,981
I want to see daddy!
I'm going to meet him.

572
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:27,872
It's all right, my baby.
Daddy is working.

573
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:32,289
I want to see daddy.
I want to see daddy.

574
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,847
I believe that we will
be able to make profits

575
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,139
of more than a billion Baht
within this quarter.

576
00:57:54,856 --> 00:57:57,481
Excuse me.
It's from the president.

577
00:57:58,081 --> 00:57:59,781
-Hi.
-Pakbhumi?

578
00:58:00,552 --> 00:58:02,006
May I speak to Chanachol?

579
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,756
What? He's not with...

580
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,939
He's in the restroom right now.
He said he has an upset stomach.

581
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:11,781
I'll tell him to call you back
right away.

582
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:14,660
How's Petch?

583
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:19,297
She's getting much better.
She had food poisoning.

584
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,172
She wants to talk to her daddy.

585
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:27,806
I'll tell him to call you back
as soon as possible.

586
00:58:28,397 --> 00:58:31,197
Maybe in the evening
because right now

587
00:58:31,439 --> 00:58:32,935
we're in the middle of the meeting.

588
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:35,531
Is that all right, Kaew?

589
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,189
all right.

590
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:47,181
What's up, my lovely bro?

591
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:48,681
Hi, Boos.

592
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:51,531
Is Mae in your office?

593
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,856
She's not in the office.

594
00:58:54,356 --> 00:58:56,381
She might be in Bang Plama
this afternoon.

595
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:58,756
Do you need anything?

596
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,681
That's all right. Fine.

597
00:59:02,056 --> 00:59:03,656
I'll give her a call later.

598
00:59:04,427 --> 00:59:05,422
Miss you.

599
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:07,622
Okay.

600
00:59:09,122 --> 00:59:09,997
Right. Bye.

601
00:59:13,272 --> 00:59:14,347
Chanachol called you?

602
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,289
No, it's Kaew.
He's not with her right now.

603
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:21,239
Where is he?

604
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:23,564
He's probably in Suphan Buri

605
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:25,364
at Mae's place.

606
00:59:26,385 --> 00:59:27,364
He has had an awakening, dad.

607
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:30,031
Good.

608
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:41,047
5.45 PM

609
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:49,839
The river is calling.

610
00:59:55,472 --> 00:59:57,539
The river is calling me.

611
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:00,889
How can I go to her?

612
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,364
I can't swim.

613
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:31,164
Hello, my lovely Shaba.

614
01:00:31,672 --> 01:00:32,689
Oh.

615
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:34,197
Is my boss with Mae?

616
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,514
8.05 PM

617
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:38,564
I miss you so badly.
I'm on my way to see you now.

618
01:00:39,464 --> 01:00:41,064
Come and pick me up at the pier.

619
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,214
See you in an hour.

620
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,439
Okay. I'll be there.

621
01:00:47,035 --> 01:00:47,906
Right.

622
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:19,906
Hi, Kaew.

623
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,781
Pakbhumi, it's me.

624
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:25,022
Now, we're heading to Pattaya.

625
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:28,147
John's arrived early

626
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:30,081
so he has to go to Pattaya right now.

627
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,206
Oh.

628
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:34,981
He's in John's car.

629
01:01:36,094 --> 01:01:37,439
His phone's battery must be dead.

630
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:40,381
When we arrive Pattaya,

631
01:01:40,814 --> 01:01:42,889
I'll tell him to call you back right way.

632
01:01:43,714 --> 01:01:44,739
Is that all right, Kaew?

633
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:55,497
I think the party is over.

634
01:01:56,552 --> 01:01:57,747
I don't want to leave.

635
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,472
I want to stay over

636
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:00,822
then go back in the morning.

637
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:02,822
Is that a good idea?

638
01:02:03,227 --> 01:02:04,097
What do you mean?

639
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:07,522
You have a wife.

640
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:14,572
It doesn't matter.

641
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:17,347
It does. Trust me.

642
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:21,397
Please.

643
01:02:25,344 --> 01:02:26,881
Just one night. I promise.

644
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,731
If it's okay with you,

645
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:30,256
I can stay on the veranda.

646
01:02:33,427 --> 01:02:34,731
That's not a good idea.

647
01:02:36,594 --> 01:02:37,514
Why not?

648
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:42,064
You're not familiar with the countryside.

649
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,464
At nighttime

650
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:45,964
there will be insects

651
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:48,439
and nocturnal animals.

652
01:02:49,594 --> 01:02:50,872
You'll be bothered by them.

653
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:52,547
That's nothing to me.

654
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,547
When I was in England,

655
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:57,472
I used to go camping in the woods.

656
01:02:58,885 --> 01:02:59,772
It was great.

657
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:10,264
9.20 PM

658
01:03:30,302 --> 01:03:31,822
Sorry to make you wait.

659
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:36,906
I can wait for you.

660
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:39,281
Where's my boss?

661
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:42,189
He's staying over for the night.

662
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:44,772
Perfect.

663
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:47,172
A lantern.

664
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:48,872
I'll put it right here

665
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:51,122
so the light won't disturb you.

666
01:03:52,344 --> 01:03:53,422
When you go to bed,

667
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:55,097
tuck the net in properly.

668
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:00,072
Well,

669
01:04:01,344 --> 01:04:02,247
How can I

670
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:03,547
tuck the net in?

671
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,497
Like this.

672
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:11,839
Oh.

673
01:04:13,469 --> 01:04:14,406
I see.

674
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,372
Daddy's been bitten. A snake bit him.

675
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:38,889
BANG PLAMA RESORT,
SUPHAN BURI 10.05 PM

676
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:50,339
MAI KAEW

677
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,172
Hello.

678
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:55,897
Hello, Pakbhumi.

679
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:57,822
Is that you, Kaew?

680
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:00,931
He's in the exclusive lounge with John.

681
01:05:01,414 --> 01:05:04,164
Can you pack some clothes for him?

682
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:06,539
He has to stay in Phuket
for two days.

683
01:05:06,981 --> 01:05:08,822
He will get them
at your place in the morning.

684
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:10,697
Pakbhumi.

685
01:06:29,414 --> 01:06:34,014
11 PM

686
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:34,681
Who's that child?

687
01:07:43,969 --> 01:07:44,847
Who's that guy

688
01:07:45,469 --> 01:07:47,206
and those three women?

689
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,772
I need to find the answer.

690
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:17,756
You.

691
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:21,156
You're here.

692
01:08:24,094 --> 01:08:25,110
Why are you here?

693
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,597
Don't worry about me.

694
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:31,447
I promise you

695
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:35,122
I will be a good girl.

696
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:40,547
Go away!

697
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:42,738
Go away!
No! Don't!

698
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:48,322
Go away!

699
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:49,822
Get out of here.

700
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,556
How can you keep a huge snake?

701
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,606
It's dangerous.

702
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:15,556
No, she's not my pet.

703
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,469
Not your pet?

704
01:09:18,314 --> 01:09:20,606
Then why don't you kill it
or let someone catch it?

705
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:25,272
I think you should go back.

706
01:09:25,844 --> 01:09:27,247
Go change your clothes.

707
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,397
I'll ask Uncle Tim
to take you to the pier.

708
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:30,972
I'm not going anywhere

709
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:33,572
until I know about you
and that bloody snake.

710
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,672
Please go back. I'm begging you.

711
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:44,032
You don't belong here.

712
01:09:47,969 --> 01:09:48,822
That's not true.

713
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,372
This place

714
01:09:52,427 --> 01:09:53,397
belongs to me.

715
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:47,772
I think that you

716
01:11:48,577 --> 01:11:50,397
should take that snake
somewhere else or...

717
01:11:50,844 --> 01:11:52,272
give it to a zoo.

718
01:11:52,677 --> 01:11:54,122
She's not gonna hurt me.

719
01:11:57,344 --> 01:11:59,047
Snakes are wild animals.

720
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:02,322
It could cost you your life someday.

721
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:05,347
That will never happen.

722
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,481
What makes you so confident?

723
01:12:19,427 --> 01:12:20,647
Because she's not an animal.

724
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,397
If it's not an animal,
what is it then?

725
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:29,189
I have no idea what she is.

726
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:33,322
I just know that

727
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:34,922
my mom

728
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,089
called her "You".

729
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:40,114
The first time I met You

730
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,806
I was around six or seven years old.

731
01:12:44,139 --> 01:12:45,114
That night,

732
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:48,614
my dad brought a girl home

733
01:12:49,094 --> 01:12:51,056
and had sex with her
while my mom was in the house.

734
01:12:52,552 --> 01:12:53,406
Kosum!

735
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:56,989
-Kosum!
-He kept doing that.

736
01:13:23,906 --> 01:13:25,610
Don't be scared, my baby.

737
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:30,014
She'll take care of you for me.

738
01:13:31,802 --> 01:13:33,756
Please call her "You".

739
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:51,922
Hello to You.

740
01:14:40,747 --> 01:14:44,022
Since then, I've met her quite often

741
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:45,806
in our house

742
01:14:46,344 --> 01:14:47,431
or at the hill.

743
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:49,881
Back then I still thought

744
01:14:50,135 --> 01:14:52,906
You was my mom's pet snake.

745
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:05,522
When my mom

746
01:15:06,344 --> 01:15:08,947
took me to a boarding school
in Bangkok,

747
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:10,897
that was the first time

748
01:15:11,385 --> 01:15:13,422
that I didn't see You

749
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:15,072
for a long period of time.

750
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:25,747
When my mom and dad
died in a mysterious accident,

751
01:15:26,552 --> 01:15:28,772
I was in high school.

752
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:32,864
I came back for my parents' funeral.

753
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:39,072
I thought I'd have a chance
to see You.

754
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:40,847
But You

755
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:42,797
had gone

756
01:15:43,177 --> 01:15:45,206
without a trace.

757
01:15:49,427 --> 01:15:52,972
I can remember the day
that You came back.

758
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,114
It was the summer break

759
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:56,822
of my first year

760
01:15:57,614 --> 01:15:59,164
in college.

761
01:15:59,885 --> 01:16:01,114
That was the first time

762
01:16:01,522 --> 01:16:04,272
I experienced

763
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,414
sexual intercourse.

764
01:16:08,344 --> 01:16:09,239
That evening,

765
01:16:10,152 --> 01:16:11,389
I went home

766
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,714
like I always did at every summer break.

767
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:17,322
I was so proud

768
01:16:19,094 --> 01:16:20,222
and happy

769
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:23,947
to be a real woman.

770
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:27,747
Even though we hadn't met for ten years,

771
01:16:29,594 --> 01:16:31,164
I knew right away

772
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:33,172
that it was You.

773
01:16:35,469 --> 01:16:36,964
The way You looked at me

774
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:40,622
is like a guardian

775
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:42,939
who has been waiting for me

776
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:46,347
who misbehaved,

777
01:16:48,594 --> 01:16:49,697
so she can condemn

778
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:52,397
and reprove me

779
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,106
with her love

780
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:57,239
and kindness.

781
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:14,981
Now you know my secret.

782
01:17:17,306 --> 01:17:20,031
You can call me a weirdo

783
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:22,997
like everyone else.

784
01:17:27,344 --> 01:17:28,597
Don't you know

785
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:33,997
that I'm a weirdo too.

786
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:36,589
Just like you.

787
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:42,814
Actually, I have no idea

788
01:17:45,885 --> 01:17:46,989
who I really am.

789
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:58,514
I was an orphan,

790
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:05,364
adopted by my new parents.

791
01:18:08,052 --> 01:18:08,964
They didn't have a kid.

792
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:12,614
I still hold on to the hope

793
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,956
that one day

794
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:18,372
I will be able to meet

795
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,914
my real parents,

796
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:26,447
my dad and my mom...

797
01:18:33,594 --> 01:18:34,722
Just once.

798
01:18:37,072 --> 01:18:38,019
Someday

799
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:40,731
you will meet them.

800
01:18:41,394 --> 01:18:42,647
I believe that you will.

801
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:57,947
Boo.

802
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,047
One more time, okay?

803
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,397
No, I can't.

804
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:04,972
You've already had two.

805
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:07,822
Come on. I'll do the work.

806
01:19:09,885 --> 01:19:13,214
PONTHIP

807
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:19,797
Hello.

808
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,640
The meeting in Phuket is cancelled.

809
01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:27,572
Mr. John is sick
so he will set it for another date.

810
01:19:27,664 --> 01:19:28,535
Okay.

811
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:35,939
LOVE SICK

812
01:19:36,469 --> 01:19:42,572
6.30 AM

813
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:06,139
Good morning, Uncle.

814
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:09,797
If you take a walk in this area,

815
01:20:10,427 --> 01:20:11,447
beware of snakes.

816
01:20:12,427 --> 01:20:13,847
I met her last night.

817
01:20:14,885 --> 01:20:16,197
I'll take it as a good sign

818
01:20:17,552 --> 01:20:18,547
for encountering You.

819
01:20:20,844 --> 01:20:21,847
You are so lucky.

820
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,606
Take this sword.

821
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:27,772
Carry it when you're in this area.

822
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:29,431
You'll be safe.

823
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,722
You make it sound like
a magic sword in a superhero movie.

824
01:20:35,135 --> 01:20:36,372
You could say so.

825
01:20:37,802 --> 01:20:38,672
Hold it.

826
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:01,622
I have found my answer. This is it.

827
01:21:02,005 --> 01:21:03,297
The place I've always searched for,

828
01:21:03,927 --> 01:21:04,822
it's here in Bang Plama

829
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:06,097
with Mekhala.

830
01:21:10,889 --> 01:21:13,447
Those are sai yud flowers.

831
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,464
Their sweet scent

832
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,793
is so strong early in the morning.

833
01:21:19,885 --> 01:21:21,689
The scent is fleeting

834
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,556
but it still smells nice.

835
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:43,364
Mae...

836
01:21:47,052 --> 01:21:48,264
right now I don't really know

837
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:50,489
the way you feel about me.

838
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,964
I just want you to know that

839
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,939
my feeling for you is real.

840
01:22:00,802 --> 01:22:01,689
I love you.

841
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:33,264
No! Don't!

842
01:22:34,847 --> 01:22:35,922
No! Don't!

843
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:46,481
You need to get of here right now,
Uncle Tim.

844
01:22:46,906 --> 01:22:48,447
Please take him to the pier.

845
01:22:48,656 --> 01:22:51,397
-Let's go.
-She's hurt.

846
01:22:51,481 --> 01:22:54,059
-She's gonna make it.
-Nonsense, Mae.

847
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:55,439
You have to trust me.

848
01:23:05,635 --> 01:23:06,656
If she wanted to kill you,

849
01:23:07,844 --> 01:23:09,256
you would be dead by now.

850
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:11,906
You attacked her.

851
01:23:13,635 --> 01:23:14,581
She'll be after you.

852
01:23:16,135 --> 01:23:18,056
Have you ever heard
about a mad cobra's grudge?

853
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:20,831
Never.

854
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:23,356
You can't go back there.

855
01:23:24,552 --> 01:23:25,922
I will.

856
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:29,214
Your magic sword saved my life once.

857
01:23:29,897 --> 01:23:31,472
Don't underestimate her.

858
01:23:39,677 --> 01:23:41,631
Pakbhumi,
you came here to pick me up?

859
01:23:42,552 --> 01:23:45,339
I have good news.
The meeting in Phuket is cancelled.

860
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:46,439
John is sick.

861
01:23:47,677 --> 01:23:50,189
How about you?
Have fun last night?

862
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:53,714
Your daughter is perfectly well.

863
01:23:55,302 --> 01:23:56,356
Thanks a lot, bro.

864
01:24:00,594 --> 01:24:07,339
10 AM

865
01:24:23,364 --> 01:24:24,447
How are you, my baby?

866
01:24:24,772 --> 01:24:27,326
-Daddy is back.
-Are you well?

867
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,581
She's getting much better.
She can go to school tomorrow.

868
01:24:30,972 --> 01:24:35,022
-I had a bad dream last night.
-Yeah?

869
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:38,472
Tell me about it.
What was your nightmare?

870
01:24:39,344 --> 01:24:43,847
You were bitten by a giant snake
in my dream. I cried a lot.

871
01:24:48,552 --> 01:24:49,406
Really?

872
01:24:50,677 --> 01:24:53,481
Don't worry. Don't you know

873
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,456
that I have a magic sword
to fight off snakes with?

874
01:24:55,927 --> 01:24:58,656
Daddy, you're the best.

875
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:03,022
Daddy has to go now
or he'll miss his flight.

876
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:05,197
I packed your suitcase.

877
01:25:06,427 --> 01:25:07,272
Thanks.

878
01:25:07,497 --> 01:25:09,922
Where are you going this time?

879
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:14,056
I have a meeting
with some foreign businessmen in Phuket.

880
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:15,481
Do you want anything?

881
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,822
I want a magic sword
to fight a snake with.

882
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:21,456
Okay, I'll get one for you.

883
01:25:21,781 --> 01:25:25,464
Are you all right?
You must be exhausted after last night.

884
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:28,481
Even Pakbhumi sounded like
he was out of breath.

885
01:25:29,927 --> 01:25:33,356
John made me drink a lot
so I passed out.

886
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:35,697
Your phone's battery was dead too?

887
01:25:36,577 --> 01:25:37,447
Yeah.

888
01:25:39,469 --> 01:25:41,347
Are there peep flowers in Pattaya?

889
01:25:44,344 --> 01:25:45,614
What is this?

890
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:47,889
Smells so nice.

891
01:25:51,622 --> 01:25:52,497
It's called sai yud.

892
01:25:54,072 --> 01:25:55,664
What's this stain on your pants?

893
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,272
I might have fallen when I was drunk.

894
01:26:01,219 --> 01:26:02,397
I told Sman

895
01:26:02,844 --> 01:26:05,147
to drive you to the airport.

896
01:26:05,269 --> 01:26:07,656
No. I'll drive to the airport

897
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:10,214
so I can get home early
after the meeting is done.

898
01:26:12,135 --> 01:26:12,997
I'm leaving.

899
01:26:14,552 --> 01:26:15,847
You forgot your suitcase.

900
01:26:20,311 --> 01:26:21,417
Thanks.

901
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:36,306
Good morning.

902
01:26:38,177 --> 01:26:39,781
Where have you been all night?

903
01:26:41,302 --> 01:26:42,681
I stayed over in Bang Plama.

904
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,564
I've been waiting for you since 1 AM.

905
01:26:46,094 --> 01:26:47,389
I missed you so badly.

906
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:50,064
No, Phot. I have to go work.

907
01:26:50,527 --> 01:26:51,964
You should do the same thing.

908
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,764
Fuck work.

909
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,314
You and me,

910
01:26:55,469 --> 01:26:56,964
we are both owners of companies.

911
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,639
Who would dare to say a word

912
01:26:59,010 --> 01:26:59,939
if we were late for work?

913
01:27:01,214 --> 01:27:02,589
Get out of my house.

914
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,681
You tell me to go away?

915
01:27:06,552 --> 01:27:07,956
Get out of my house now.

916
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:09,756
Mae...

917
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:11,731
Are you seeing someone else?

918
01:27:13,219 --> 01:27:15,481
Yes, I am.

919
01:27:16,427 --> 01:27:17,497
What's the big deal!

920
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:19,181
I have always had someone else

921
01:27:19,606 --> 01:27:21,181
since we've been in a relationship.

922
01:27:21,672 --> 01:27:22,622
We both know that, Phot.

923
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,214
And you

924
01:27:24,885 --> 01:27:26,289
already have a wife and a kid.

925
01:27:26,852 --> 01:27:27,706
So

926
01:27:28,135 --> 01:27:30,264
you have no right to claim me.

927
01:27:30,464 --> 01:27:31,489
Please remember that.

928
01:27:39,844 --> 01:27:41,164
If you have someone else,

929
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,489
-I will kill you.
-You can't kill me, Phot.

930
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:46,306
Just like your men

931
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:48,164
can't kill that snake at my place.

932
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,964
You'll see

933
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,631
that I

934
01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:54,839
can kill that stupid snake.

935
01:27:55,272 --> 01:27:58,089
If I can do it, you'll be next.

936
01:28:15,344 --> 01:28:20,031
1 PM

937
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:23,181
Hi, Dad.

938
01:28:25,844 --> 01:28:27,639
Chanachol is not coming today?

939
01:28:28,552 --> 01:28:29,414
Yes, dad.

940
01:28:30,635 --> 01:28:32,214
Is he with that girl, Mekhala?

941
01:28:33,219 --> 01:28:34,239
Exactly.

942
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:38,989
Mai Kaew needs to know about this.

943
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:43,806
Why?

944
01:28:46,677 --> 01:28:49,131
It's time they got divorced.

945
01:28:53,302 --> 01:28:54,206
Is that a good idea?

946
01:28:55,802 --> 01:28:56,681
It must be.

947
01:29:16,469 --> 01:29:20,331
Can you tell me that you love me,
Mekhala?

948
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:27,039
Chanachol, you act like a teenage boy.

949
01:29:27,156 --> 01:29:29,356
You're not going to Phuket?

950
01:29:30,094 --> 01:29:31,889
It's definitely because of me.

951
01:29:32,469 --> 01:29:33,356
No, it's not.

952
01:29:33,885 --> 01:29:34,947
They cancelled the meeting.

953
01:29:36,094 --> 01:29:37,272
That's why I'm here.

954
01:29:39,514 --> 01:29:40,714
I want to hang out with you.

955
01:29:41,635 --> 01:29:42,714
Make yourself at home.

956
01:29:43,239 --> 01:29:44,939
There's no snake to bother you here.

957
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:52,406
2 PM

958
01:30:01,181 --> 01:30:06,206
YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH MEKHALA PLABPLA

959
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:31,464
MISS MEKHALA PLABPLA
AGE 33 YEARS OLD

960
01:30:39,927 --> 01:30:40,781
Pakbhumi, is that you?

961
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:42,350
How's the business in Phuket?

962
01:30:42,885 --> 01:30:44,881
Is Chanachol busy right now?

963
01:30:46,427 --> 01:30:47,456
It's me, Kaew.

964
01:30:50,177 --> 01:30:51,639
Chanachol is not in Phuket.

965
01:30:52,802 --> 01:30:55,381
John is sick.
He's still in Australia right now.

966
01:30:56,427 --> 01:30:57,997
We didn't go to Pattaya yesterday.

967
01:30:58,969 --> 01:31:01,222
Chanachol made Pakbhumi
tell you that.

968
01:31:02,177 --> 01:31:03,597
If he didn't order it,

969
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:05,522
no one would dare to lie to you.

970
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:08,747
Pakbhumi is with me now.

971
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:12,881
Right, See you.

972
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:24,895
Thanks, Dad.

973
01:31:53,664 --> 01:31:54,589
You fucking snake!

974
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,147
Where are you?

975
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,597
Come out!

976
01:33:08,052 --> 01:33:08,914
You,

977
01:33:10,052 --> 01:33:10,914
let him go.

978
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:13,439
He's dead.

979
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,664
Mae, you have a guest.

980
01:33:46,706 --> 01:33:48,614
Sorry, I'm quite late.

981
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:50,731
No. I'm so late.

982
01:33:55,056 --> 01:33:56,531
I'm Mekhala.

983
01:33:57,506 --> 01:33:58,706
Can I help you?

984
01:34:04,714 --> 01:34:07,347
I'm Chanachol's wife.

985
01:34:09,122 --> 01:34:11,822
You had sex with him, didn't you?

986
01:34:17,994 --> 01:34:18,872
I did.

987
01:34:21,997 --> 01:34:22,897
You're such a whore.

988
01:34:24,177 --> 01:34:25,339
Having an affair with my man.

989
01:34:26,489 --> 01:34:27,864
Leave him alone.

990
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:31,264
Gold digger.

991
01:34:44,552 --> 01:34:45,414
Mae,

992
01:34:46,177 --> 01:34:48,947
Uncle Tim called and told me
that Phot has died from snakebites.

993
01:35:14,969 --> 01:35:19,414
3 PM

994
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:46,531
I warned him many times

995
01:35:47,635 --> 01:35:48,981
but he never listened to me.

996
01:35:51,135 --> 01:35:53,156
You are the only woman

997
01:35:54,135 --> 01:35:55,156
that Phot loved.

998
01:35:56,927 --> 01:35:59,006
He must be happy
that you have come to see him.

999
01:36:00,164 --> 01:36:01,589
Thank you very much.

1000
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,456
Please cleanse his body.

1001
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:33,289
Who are you?

1002
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:37,381
I'm his friend.

1003
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,897
Your dad was my best friend.

1004
01:36:53,802 --> 01:36:56,231
That woman is gorgeous and smart.

1005
01:36:56,969 --> 01:36:58,531
But she is such a whore,

1006
01:36:58,844 --> 01:37:00,156
always messing with married men.

1007
01:37:01,344 --> 01:37:03,631
She has ruined so many couples.

1008
01:37:04,427 --> 01:37:05,306
I think that

1009
01:37:06,302 --> 01:37:08,606
you should think it over.

1010
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,431
I've made my mind up, Uncle.

1011
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:15,906
I want a divorce.

1012
01:37:20,469 --> 01:37:23,839
You should talk to him first.

1013
01:37:25,969 --> 01:37:28,147
Where can I meet him, Uncle?

1014
01:37:32,039 --> 01:37:32,914
Pakbhumi

1015
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:35,322
do you know where Chanachol is?

1016
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,147
I think I do.

1017
01:38:01,969 --> 01:38:03,706
I am a true sinner, Boos.

1018
01:38:06,427 --> 01:38:08,206
I must be sent to hell when I die.

1019
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,664
That's not true, Mae.

1020
01:38:17,969 --> 01:38:19,389
Where's our group tour
going tomorrow?

1021
01:38:22,135 --> 01:38:25,247
To China, Xi'an airport.

1022
01:38:27,594 --> 01:38:28,997
I'll be in charge of that group.

1023
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:42,689
5 PM

1024
01:38:59,469 --> 01:39:00,456
Kosum!

1025
01:39:01,597 --> 01:39:02,597
Kosum!

1026
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:05,039
Are you crazy?

1027
01:39:05,385 --> 01:39:07,297
-Kosum!
-Let me go!

1028
01:39:08,164 --> 01:39:09,547
What's wrong with you?

1029
01:39:10,897 --> 01:39:12,094
Cherd, let me go.

1030
01:39:12,339 --> 01:39:13,589
Get out of my house.

1031
01:39:14,072 --> 01:39:15,672
All of you, go away!

1032
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:17,356
Cherd...

1033
01:40:54,302 --> 01:41:00,889
6 PM

1034
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:03,081
Keep in mind, Pakbhumi,

1035
01:41:04,094 --> 01:41:05,297
that everything I've done,

1036
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,172
it's all for you.

1037
01:41:13,677 --> 01:41:14,522
I know, Dad.

1038
01:41:27,885 --> 01:41:28,731
Excuse me,

1039
01:41:28,972 --> 01:41:31,456
-can you take me to Mekhala's?
-Sure.

1040
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:12,422
You shouldn't be here.

1041
01:42:14,677 --> 01:42:15,572
She's not home.

1042
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,647
I'm not here for Mae.

1043
01:42:19,552 --> 01:42:20,697
I'm here for you.

1044
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,622
Thirty years ago...

1045
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:33,922
7.30 PM

1046
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,947
...at this house

1047
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,697
was there a little boy
who lived here?

1048
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,631
Why do you ask?

1049
01:42:45,135 --> 01:42:46,781
I had a dream about that boy.

1050
01:42:48,135 --> 01:42:49,481
I saw his parents.

1051
01:42:50,885 --> 01:42:52,406
I saw Mae's parents

1052
01:42:54,177 --> 01:42:55,281
and I saw you.

1053
01:42:59,844 --> 01:43:00,889
What was that dream?

1054
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,347
It's really weird.

1055
01:43:09,494 --> 01:43:11,647
I saw that boy's mother

1056
01:43:11,981 --> 01:43:13,552
was having an affair
with Mae's father.

1057
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,339
So that boy's family
had to leave this house.

1058
01:43:18,456 --> 01:43:19,381
But...

1059
01:43:20,344 --> 01:43:21,881
the boat sank.

1060
01:43:25,177 --> 01:43:26,039
That boy...

1061
01:43:30,344 --> 01:43:31,197
drowned.

1062
01:43:34,969 --> 01:43:36,872
That boy's mom was named Tome.

1063
01:43:39,752 --> 01:43:41,347
She was my only sister.

1064
01:43:42,594 --> 01:43:43,972
My nephew's name was Daeng.

1065
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,047
He was so adorable.

1066
01:43:48,552 --> 01:43:50,022
He shouldn't have died.

1067
01:43:53,285 --> 01:43:54,189
Uncle,

1068
01:43:55,364 --> 01:43:57,047
I believe that boy, Daeng,
your nephew,

1069
01:43:59,052 --> 01:43:59,914
is not dead.

1070
01:44:04,344 --> 01:44:05,339
How do you know?

1071
01:44:07,635 --> 01:44:09,739
They haven't found his body yet.

1072
01:44:15,094 --> 01:44:16,006
That's because I--

1073
01:44:16,272 --> 01:44:17,422
Chanachol,

1074
01:44:18,344 --> 01:44:19,689
you shouldn't be here.

1075
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:23,714
Uncle Tim, please take him
back to the pier.

1076
01:44:25,585 --> 01:44:27,897
-Mae, calm down and hear me out.
-No.

1077
01:44:28,427 --> 01:44:29,747
You have to leave.

1078
01:44:30,385 --> 01:44:32,872
Did Uncle Tim tell you
that my friend

1079
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:34,872
was bitten to death
by You this afternoon.

1080
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:37,672
You must leave, trust me.

1081
01:44:38,172 --> 01:44:39,097
Calm down, Mae.

1082
01:44:40,331 --> 01:44:42,164
I know what calls me to this house.

1083
01:44:42,344 --> 01:44:44,881
I know who am I, Mae.

1084
01:44:45,156 --> 01:44:47,756
I think I'm Daeng,
Uncle Tim's nephew who drowned.

1085
01:44:48,552 --> 01:44:49,731
What are you talking about?

1086
01:44:50,427 --> 01:44:52,047
I've never hear anything about that.

1087
01:44:52,844 --> 01:44:53,772
I saw it in my dream.

1088
01:44:53,885 --> 01:44:55,764
It's just a dream,

1089
01:44:55,994 --> 01:44:57,297
you can't take it seriously.

1090
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:00,047
You saw the pictures
of my dad and my mom.

1091
01:45:00,219 --> 01:45:02,206
You see this house,
you see Uncle Tim.

1092
01:45:02,356 --> 01:45:04,331
You've made up a story in your head.

1093
01:45:05,122 --> 01:45:06,022
I can't believe it,

1094
01:45:06,589 --> 01:45:07,914
you're obsessed.

1095
01:45:08,506 --> 01:45:09,806
Are you calling me crazy?

1096
01:45:11,052 --> 01:45:11,997
I think you...

1097
01:45:12,677 --> 01:45:15,047
have an overactive imagination.

1098
01:45:15,135 --> 01:45:18,272
-Just like you and that snake.
-You need to leave.

1099
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:21,897
I've made up my mind.

1100
01:45:28,135 --> 01:45:29,106
About what?

1101
01:45:54,594 --> 01:45:55,656
No! Don't!

1102
01:46:13,552 --> 01:46:14,864
You,

1103
01:46:15,964 --> 01:46:17,164
I'm begging you.

1104
01:46:17,594 --> 01:46:19,147
Please don't take his life.

1105
01:46:20,469 --> 01:46:21,631
I love him.

1106
01:46:23,552 --> 01:46:25,456
Like you love me.

1107
01:46:27,519 --> 01:46:29,122
If you want to kill him,

1108
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:31,797
please kill me as well.

1109
01:47:35,385 --> 01:47:36,306
You,

1110
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:40,206
please forgive me.

1111
01:48:02,419 --> 01:48:09,364
10.30 PM

1112
01:48:13,677 --> 01:48:15,914
TW 4070
BANGKOK

1113
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:22,964
I will rent a boat
and take you to her house.

1114
01:48:26,856 --> 01:48:27,902
No need for that.

1115
01:48:36,156 --> 01:48:37,231
Are you sure?

1116
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:43,156
You know what, Pakbhumi?

1117
01:48:46,844 --> 01:48:48,156
He hasn't had sex with me

1118
01:48:49,052 --> 01:48:50,081
for six months.

1119
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:55,322
That woman,

1120
01:48:56,427 --> 01:48:57,772
she's really gorgeous.

1121
01:49:03,219 --> 01:49:05,047
You are gorgeous too.

1122
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:11,747
Really?

1123
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:14,989
Really.

1124
01:49:19,156 --> 01:49:20,231
If so,

1125
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:23,081
kiss me.

1126
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,631
Is that a good idea?

1127
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:45,314
My life...

1128
01:49:49,219 --> 01:49:51,147
will never be happy.

1129
01:50:07,135 --> 01:50:08,039
It will.

1130
01:50:10,177 --> 01:50:11,056
It definitely will.

1131
01:52:19,469 --> 01:52:24,939
DISCOVERY

1132
01:52:25,389 --> 01:52:28,575
4.30 AM

1133
01:54:24,377 --> 01:54:25,239
Sweet music.

1134
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:29,939
Isn't it sad?

1135
01:54:33,594 --> 01:54:34,556
Sweet music...

1136
01:54:38,177 --> 01:54:39,139
always makes you sad.

1137
01:55:06,344 --> 01:55:07,247
Goodbye.

1138
01:55:10,152 --> 01:55:11,039
No goodbye.

1139
01:55:14,089 --> 01:55:15,189
I'm sure we will meet again.

1140
01:55:17,247 --> 01:55:18,122
Mae,

1141
01:55:19,135 --> 01:55:20,364
you need to go now.

1142
01:55:24,969 --> 01:55:25,822
I've got to go.

1143
01:55:27,677 --> 01:55:28,697
Please keep in mind,

1144
01:55:29,436 --> 01:55:30,547
you're my first love

1145
01:55:33,844 --> 01:55:34,997
and my only love.

1146
01:55:36,177 --> 01:55:37,064
Right.

1147
01:55:37,339 --> 01:55:38,214
I will.

1148
01:55:40,097 --> 01:55:41,022
I'm leaving.

1149
01:55:44,594 --> 01:55:47,106
I feel like my heart
has been ripped out.

1150
01:55:49,927 --> 01:55:51,922
She might not come back to me ever again.

1151
01:55:53,935 --> 01:55:54,872
I can believe it.

1152
01:56:02,231 --> 01:56:05,714
7.30 AM

1153
01:57:32,914 --> 01:57:36,581
-The kid is safe.
-What about his parents?

1154
01:57:36,922 --> 01:57:38,422
They drowned.

1155
01:57:38,931 --> 01:57:41,306
Take the kid to a hospital.

1156
01:57:47,756 --> 01:57:50,681
Oh, he's so cute.

1157
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,539
There's no way you can
make that kid your heir!

1158
01:58:06,135 --> 01:58:08,889
Sending him to study in England
is already more than enough.

1159
01:58:10,264 --> 01:58:12,764
I've made up my mind, Direk.

1160
01:59:09,522 --> 01:59:13,714
9 AM

1161
01:59:16,469 --> 01:59:17,431
Uncle...

1162
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,781
I'm pretty sure

1163
01:59:31,885 --> 01:59:32,789
I'm Daeng,

1164
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:35,264
your nephew
who drowned in the river.

1165
01:59:47,969 --> 01:59:49,147
I want to give you my respect

1166
01:59:49,672 --> 01:59:52,072
as a member of my real family.

1167
02:00:20,322 --> 02:00:22,022
This house is cursed.

1168
02:00:24,022 --> 02:00:25,422
It's a house of sinners.

1169
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:29,264
You should stay away from this place.

1170
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:37,681
Please call me Daeng, Uncle.

1171
02:00:45,514 --> 02:00:46,360
Sure.

1172
02:00:48,522 --> 02:00:49,397
Daeng, my boy.

1173
02:00:54,094 --> 02:00:55,197
My mom and my dad,

1174
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:56,756
they were killed

1175
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:58,239
by You, weren't they?

1176
02:01:04,085 --> 02:01:05,414
She held a grudge against anyone

1177
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:08,614
who hurt Kosum.

1178
02:01:14,052 --> 02:01:15,247
What about Kosum?

1179
02:01:17,677 --> 02:01:18,706
How did she die?

1180
02:01:21,814 --> 02:01:24,464
Please take care of Mekhala for me,
Uncle Tim.

1181
02:01:26,677 --> 02:01:28,464
Yes, ma'am.

1182
02:02:03,281 --> 02:02:05,231
I'm ready to go with You.

1183
02:02:07,635 --> 02:02:09,131
Please take care of Mekhala for me.

1184
02:02:18,102 --> 02:02:19,206
I can't believe

1185
02:02:22,556 --> 02:02:24,131
that everything that happened here

1186
02:02:27,243 --> 02:02:28,206
is true.

1187
02:02:29,844 --> 02:02:31,272
If you believe that it's true,

1188
02:02:33,006 --> 02:02:33,881
then it is.

1189
02:02:34,906 --> 02:02:36,481
If you don't believe that it's true

1190
02:02:38,469 --> 02:02:39,372
then it's not.

1191
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:50,272
I believe that it's true.

1192
02:02:58,514 --> 02:02:59,647
If you think so,

1193
02:03:01,314 --> 02:03:02,631
don't come back.

1194
02:03:04,077 --> 02:03:04,956
Please go.

1195
02:03:06,035 --> 02:03:06,964
I'll take you to the pier.

1196
02:03:07,744 --> 02:03:08,897
That's okay, Uncle.

1197
02:03:10,777 --> 02:03:11,781
I'll take a boat.

1198
02:03:13,885 --> 02:03:14,939
Can you do that?

1199
02:03:16,894 --> 02:03:17,847
I'm Daeng,

1200
02:03:20,802 --> 02:03:21,906
your nephew, aren't I?

1201
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,356
I feel like I'm finally
free from everything.

1202
02:03:52,094 --> 02:03:53,097
My body feels so light,

1203
02:03:53,427 --> 02:03:54,597
like it's weightless.

1204
02:03:55,844 --> 02:03:57,372
The world seems to move slower.

1205
02:03:59,177 --> 02:04:00,072
I think this is it,

1206
02:04:00,552 --> 02:04:01,572
the freedom

1207
02:04:02,094 --> 02:04:03,272
that I've always wanted.

1208
02:04:10,427 --> 02:04:11,339
You,

1209
02:04:12,594 --> 02:04:13,789
I'm ready to leave.

1210
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:18,539
Please take me away
from this crazy world.

1211
02:04:20,247 --> 02:04:21,281
Right now,

1212
02:04:22,539 --> 02:04:24,564
I need some peace.

1213
02:04:37,469 --> 02:04:42,356
9.30 AM

1214
02:05:02,194 --> 02:05:04,681
TWO YEARS LATER

1215
02:05:05,223 --> 02:05:06,556
3 PM

1216
02:05:06,697 --> 02:05:09,747
This boat is a time machine
that will bring you back in time

1217
02:05:10,072 --> 02:05:12,622
to a hundred years ago.

1218
02:05:13,397 --> 02:05:17,789
Please turn off your mobile phone
when we get off the boat. Thanks.

1219
02:05:18,581 --> 02:05:20,381
Just like when the plane is taking off.

1220
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:43,981
What's up?

1221
02:05:45,372 --> 02:05:46,747
Hi, Mae.

1222
02:05:47,106 --> 02:05:51,006
The president has come
a long way to visit my house.

1223
02:05:53,014 --> 02:05:55,339
Mae, this is Ekkabhop.
He's my new business partner.

1224
02:05:55,885 --> 02:05:57,981
Ekkabhop, this is Mae,
the owner of this house.

1225
02:06:06,964 --> 02:06:08,214
Nice to meet you.

1226
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:11,614
Nice to meet you too.

1227
02:06:13,219 --> 02:06:14,156
Please.

1228
