23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 20)

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,420
(Music and Dance Academy)

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,220
That day,

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,540
Your Highness took my lady away

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,500
right from this room.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,020
It's only been half a month since,

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,740
Miss Lin was killed,

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,660
Young Master Han conquered the city,

31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,020
and you were detained.

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,820
What a turn of events!

33
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,460
Things are the same, yet people are no more.

34
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,260
If it wasn't for the death of Lin Qi,

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,300
I wouldn't have to trick
Han Shuo into leaving,

36
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,100
and make things turn out like this.

37
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,260
Butler Lin, may her rest in peace!

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,820
When the Second Princess
was determined to kill my lady,

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,900
it was Your Highness who saved her.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,700
Although you decided to exile her,

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,180
before she left,

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,140
you gave her a golden token.

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,140
Even though my lady

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,020
was still killed in the end,

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,700
we do owe you one.

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,900
I will never forget that.

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,020
Open the door.

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,780
Butler Lin, someone sent this brocade box

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,180
and asked me to give it to you.

50
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,180
Alright.

51
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
Your Highness!

52
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,980
The golden token I gave to Lin Qi?

53
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,500
Look at this.

54
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,940
(The letter represents me. I'm doing fine.
I'm at Xuanhu City. Don't miss me.)

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,900
"The letter represents me. I'm doing fine."

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Lin Qi is alive!

57
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,140
My lady is alive?!

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
That's so great!

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,460
The Lins won't be childless now!

60
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,700
Lin Qi is...

61
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,220
Wait! Wait a sec!

62
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,900
Wait a sec!

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,900
Calm down! I need to clear my mind!

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
Why would I make Han Shuo leave?

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,500
Because I thought

66
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,020
the plots were out of my control.

67
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,340
I was afraid that Han Shuo
would end up in the plots I wrote.

68
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,540
But where did I get that idea?

69
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,740
Because...

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,700
Because my mother had a stroke,

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,620
Lu Peng died, and Lin Qi also died.

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,980
But I wrote all of those.

73
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,380
However, my mother has recovered,

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,460
it's proved that Chuchu killed Lu Peng,

75
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,620
and Lin Qi didn't die.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,180
Lin Qi is alive!

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,620
It means I can change the fate
of the characters!

78
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,260
It means Han Shuo

79
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,740
won't end up in the pre-set plots!

80
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,020
So, what's the point of fighting with Han Shuo?

81
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,380
Qianqian, what's wrong?

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,020
Your Highness, aren't you happy

83
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,980
that my lady is alive?

84
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,980
I am happy.

85
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,380
But I don't think

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,340
your lady and I will get along.

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,900
Look the letter she wrote. What is that?

88
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,060
She's fine, but I'm not!

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,140
Pei Heng,

90
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
I have to go back.

91
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,700
Go back to Yueli Mansion?

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,820
Qianqian, don't be willful.

93
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,820
It took me great efforts
to get you out of there!

94
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,660
Han Shuo is like a wild animal now.

95
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,220
You want to become his prey again?

96
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,340
It's hard to explain to you

97
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,140
what happened between us.

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,060
Han Shuo humiliated you so badly.

99
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,460
Why do you have to go back?

100
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,020
Because it was just a misunderstanding!

101
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,860
He won't treat me like that anymore

102
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,540
once we talk it out.

103
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,660
I can't watch you

104
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,340
jumping into the fire pit again.

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,020
But I have to go back.

106
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,700
Butler Lin,

107
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,500
is there any way to get me back
to Yueli Mansion

108
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,820
without letting other people know?

109
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,860
How did you get out of there then?

110
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,820
Pei Heng, I'm sorry!

111
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,100
Qianqian, don't go!

112
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,980
Qianqian!

113
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,580
Qianqian!

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,060
(A pure heart and spirit)

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,220
The situation is settled now.

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
You are already my prisoner.

117
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,220
Between the City Owner Seal and your life,

118
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,140
which one is more important?

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,060
I believe that you are a smart person.

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,220
You will make a smart choice.

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,620
To ordinary people,

122
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,260
life is certainly more important.

123
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,620
But as the owner of Huayuan City,

124
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,860
I'm responsible for the future of our city.

125
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,500
To me,

126
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,180
the City Owner Seal

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,700
is surely more important than my life!

128
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,100
If you are being stubborn,

129
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,140
then don't blame me for being harsh.

130
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,500
Then why don't you just kill me?

131
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,420
You think I don't dare?

132
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,340
I'm not afraid of death,

133
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,940
but my poor youngest daughter Qianqian

134
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,700
will have to deal with the pain
of losing her mother.

135
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,060
She will cry about it

136
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,100
for three days!

137
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,660
Are you threatening me?

138
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,540
Young Master,

139
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,900
you just said

140
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,500
that you were the knife, and I was the meat.

141
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,060
You are the one
who's threatening me right now.

142
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,900
Good!

143
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,860
Women in Huayuan City are known

144
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,260
as tactful and crafty.

145
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,300
I've seen it up close many times.

146
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,420
Your Majesty, take good care.

147
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,340
About the City Owner Seal,

148
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,540
I'll figure out another way.

149
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
But Qianqian is such a filial daughter.

150
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,100
Though you spare my life today,

151
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,140
during this chaotic time,

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,620
if someone else

153
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,580
killed me,

154
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,140
Qianqian would still

155
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,700
blame you for it.

156
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,180
If my death caused discord
between you and Qianqian,

157
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,900
how could I

158
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,380
rest in peace after I died?

159
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,660
You are indeed a cunning woman!

160
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,700
In that case,

161
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,180
I can't kill you,

162
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,940
instead, I actually have to protect you.

163
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,580
Don't flatter me.

164
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,300
You were able to

165
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,100
conquer the city overnight,

166
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,300
it shows you hid your evil plan very well.

167
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,060
I don't even trust my own daughters,

168
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,620
let alone trust you to protect me.

169
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,460
Carefully guard her bedroom!

170
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,580
No one is allowed to be out

171
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,500
or in!

172
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,380
Yes!

173
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,860
Why are you coming back?

174
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,060
We forgot our instruments.

175
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,260
Go get them now, and then leave!

176
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,380
Are you here to pick me up?

177
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,260
Hurry!

178
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,020
Your Highness, how come you are back, too?

179
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,820
I don't have time to explain!

180
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,980
Let's change our clothes back.

181
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,540
Just pretend that nothing has happened.

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,860
Do not let Han Shuo find out!

183
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,460
If he does,

184
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,060
just tell him

185
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,740
that you forced me to go,

186
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,340
but I refused determinedly

187
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,900
and said I wouldn't go anywhere,

188
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,580
I'd only stay with Han Shuo!

189
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,300
Got it?

190
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,580
Yes!

191
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,060
Well. Listen.

192
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,300
Han... Han Shuo, please let me explain.

193
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,740
I didn't want to run away, I...

194
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,380
You've changed your clothes.

195
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,140
How could you say you didn't want to?

196
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,180
I did run away, but I came back.

197
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,340
Will you believe me?

198
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,820
Bai Ji.

199
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,780
Young Master!

200
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,780
Your Highness!

201
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,580
You've put on the musician's clothes
and try to run away?

202
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,900
Young Master.

203
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,340
Thank God that I've been guarding this place

204
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,180
without even blinking my eyes.

205
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,660
She almost succeeded.

206
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,420
Whose idea?

207
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,900
Not like that! Han Shuo, listen to me.

208
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,940
Young Master, please spare my life!

209
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,860
Minister Pei asked me to do it!

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,860
Pei Heng?

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,700
No! No!

212
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,060
You were going to run away with Pei Heng?

213
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,100
Where to?

214
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,140
Pei Heng has nothing to do with it!

215
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,460
Bai Ji.

216
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,100
Take the musicians away.

217
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,940
Yes.

218
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,460
Follow me.

219
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,060
Please don't be angry!

220
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,540
Let me explain.

221
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,700
I... I actually...

222
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,700
Wait!

223
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,940
You were playing the same trick again, right?

224
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,940
You were first dressed
as Pei Heng's servant and ran away.

225
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,380
This time, you were dressed as a musician.

226
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,900
And both times, Pei Heng was involved.

227
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,700
Looks like you really trust him a lot!

228
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,820
No! Han Shuo, it's a misunderstanding!

229
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,140
I promise I'll be with you in the future.

230
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,420
I won't go anywhere, okay?

231
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,300
I once loved you,

232
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,660
respected you, cherished you,
and cared about you.

233
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,220
But you

234
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,780
betrayed me, deceived me,
cheated me, and fooled me.

235
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,900
Apparently you think
that I can't live without you!

236
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,060
Since you could give up on my love

237
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,580
for the interest of the two cities,

238
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,460
I think I don't have to be merciful
to you anymore.

239
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,860
I'd rather consummate
our relationship right now,

240
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,060
in case you'll run away again!

241
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,340
(Divorce Letter)

242
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,100
You are still gonna use
the divorce letter to threaten me?

243
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,540
You...

244
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,500
If you want to consummate our relationship,

245
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,020
then do it!

246
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,700
You...

247
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,460
Can't believe you'd do this for Pei Heng!

248
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,180
How is this related to Pei Heng?

249
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,780
Then you are doing this for your mother!

250
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,020
You think by doing this,

251
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,900
you can save her?

252
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,980
No!

253
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,180
It's totally irrelevant to my mother!

254
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Chen Qianqian.

255
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,340
I underestimated you!

256
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
Can't believe you are shameless like this!

257
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,220
You'd use your body to make a deal with me!

258
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,940
Make a deal?

259
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,820
Han Shuo, I am being serious!

260
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
You are humiliating yourself!

261
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,460
Humiliating myself?

262
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,980
Since you don't want to be my woman...

263
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,140
I want to be!

264
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,660
...then you can be my slave.

265
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,260
That

266
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,420
is not an option！

267
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,620
From now on,

268
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,300
all chores, including
heating up water, cooking,

269
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,340
doing laundry and making bed,

270
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,980
will be

271
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,660
your responsibilities.

272
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,580
Hey, have you even been listening to me?

273
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,940
You should've seen it coming!

274
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,740
Stop!

275
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,020
Han Shuo.

276
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,260
I lowered myself yet you are still leaving?

277
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
I also have dignity, okay?

278
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Luckily I controlled myself!

279
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,220
Why did you come out again?

280
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,900
Well, the Second Princess is here.

281
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,340
She's waiting for you in the study right now.

282
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,700
Ask Chen Qianqian to serve her.

283
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes.

284
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,660
As long as our misunderstanding is addressed,

285
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,740
everything will be back to the way it was.

286
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,540
Young Master Han,

287
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,980
since you and Qianqian have divorced,

288
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,580
it's not proper for you to live together.

289
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,100
Why don't you...

290
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,700
Chen Qianqian!

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,540
Come out!

292
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Chuchu, long time no see.

293
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,620
Why were you eavesdropping by the door?

294
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,300
I wasn't.

295
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,420
You asked me to be here to serve.

296
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,780
Then what are you waiting for?
Pour us some tea.

297
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,860
Chuchu, what were you going to say?

298
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Why don't you send Qianqian
to Risheng Mansion

299
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,100
to live with Yuanyuan?

300
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,580
Good idea!

301
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,100
Whatever you say.

302
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,260
I'll listen to you!

303
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,780
I didn't expect you'd agree so quickly.

304
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,740
She's just a toy to me.

305
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,540
I can put her anywhere I want.

306
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,140
Sounds like you

307
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,180
really don't like her anymore.

308
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,700
Do you need me to prove it to you?

309
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,340
So, when are you going to

310
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,700
send Qianqian to Risheng Mansion?

311
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,700
No hurry.

312
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,780
Though she's a toy,

313
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,380
it's more fun to keep her at hand.

314
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,180
Then how about

315
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,260
you move to Xingzi Mansion?

316
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,540
It'll be convenient for us
to discuss the city matters.

317
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,340
Are you

318
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,860
treating me as a man of Huayuan City

319
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,500
so that you can boss me around?

320
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,100
What you did was just an act
to piss off Qianqian, wasn't it?

321
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,300
Looks like you just treated me
as a woman of Xuanhu City

322
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,940
and bossed me around.

323
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,340
I still have things to do.

324
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,340
Your Highness, please see yourself out.

325
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,140
Men are so unreliable

326
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,300
and unpredictable!

327
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,780
I feel hurt!

328
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,740
But I must have hurt him even more

329
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,620
when I gave him the divorce letter.

330
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,780
It's karma.

331
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,340
Your Highness,

332
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,620
Young Master is calling you over

333
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,460
to help him change clothes.

334
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,780
Please.

335
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,060
Is it too tight, Young Master?

336
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,060
-It feels good.
-Really?

337
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,740
-Yes.
-Okay!

338
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,180
Get me a cup of tea!

339
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,820
Alright!

340
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,660
Young Master, please.

341
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,660
Why is it so hot?

342
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,140
Is it?

343
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm sorry!

344
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,300
Chen Qianqian,

345
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,940
do you think I have no way to deal with you?

346
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,540
How come?

347
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
You are such a powerful man.

348
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,220
You conquered Huayuan City
and detained my mother.

349
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,300
You also threaten me every day
with little white bottles.

350
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,540
My life

351
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,660
is totally

352
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,060
at your mercy.

353
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,140
As long as you know it, Chen Qianqian!

354
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,900
Even if you die,

355
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,980
I'll let you die in my hands.

356
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,380
Don't even think about
getting out of Yueli Mansion!

357
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,700
Now,

358
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,380
go iron my clothes.

359
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,900
If I see any wrinkle,

360
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,300
you can forget about sleeping tonight!

361
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,460
Men asking women to do housework
is really a tradition

362
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,220
that's never changed since ancient times!

363
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,260
I'm exhausted!

364
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,860
Oh no!

365
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Her Majesty is resting.

366
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,700
Please go back, Your Highness!

367
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,300
Why couldn't I go into my mother's bedroom?

368
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,900
When did you replace the guards

369
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,780
with your own people?

370
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,660
You are Her Majesty's daughter.

371
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,860
If one day you change your mind,

372
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,500
I'll have to at least keep a hostage.

373
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,500
To you,

374
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,980
Chen Qianqian is already a hostage!

375
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,140
Isn't it enough

376
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,060
to have her?

377
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,100
But Chen Qianqian is not a threat to you.

378
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,660
I think you've changed your mind.

379
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,460
We made a deal

380
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,900
that we'd get the abdication decree

381
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,540
from my mother.

382
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
But now,

383
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,780
Mother still hasn't issue the decree.

384
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,780
The decree can be forged,

385
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,620
but not the seal.

386
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,100
Without the seal,

387
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,540
those old officials

388
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,700
won't accept me as the new City Owner.

389
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,020
What will you do

390
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,460
if Her Majesty doesn't hand you the seal?

391
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,820
My mother cares about Chen Qianqian the most.

392
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,420
I'll use Chen Qianqian's life
to threaten her!

393
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,100
If she refuses to give me the seal,

394
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,300
I'll cut off one finger
of Chen Qianqian every day

395
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,180
and show it to my mother.

396
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
That way, I'm sure

397
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,820
she'll hand the seal to me within three days!

398
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,220
But, it'll depend on

399
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,860
if you will feel bad for her.

400
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,380
You are such a good sister!

401
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,300
As I expected, you do pity her!

402
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,660
Don't forget our deal!

403
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,980
If I can't become the City Owner,

404
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,740
you will never get

405
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,740
that black water mine!

406
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,340
I know what I'm doing.

407
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,020
I will help you get the seal.

408
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,260
As long as you keep your promise!

409
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,180
Although you have your Xuanhu army,

410
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,260
I also have my Huayuan City Guards.

411
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,980
We certainly don't want to make things ugly.

412
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,460
Mr. Pei, even though we know
Her Highness burned her hand,

413
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,740
there's nothing we can do!

414
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,860
Stop!

415
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,260
Han Shuo!

416
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,780
Mr. Pei!

417
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,340
Han Shuo!

418
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,780
Mr. Pei!

419
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,740
What's the matter?

420
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,780
Han Shuo!

421
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,500
Han Shuo!

422
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,740
Mr. Pei!

423
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,380
Pei Heng.

424
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,620
I haven't got a chance to settle with you

425
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,740
for abducting my wife,

426
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,420
yet you

427
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,460
showed up here yourself.

428
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,020
I shouldn't have let you take Qianqian away!

429
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,500
You've never really cherished her!

430
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
And now you even tortured her!

431
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,940
How could you do that?

432
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,620
I just asked her to do some housework.

433
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
How could that be "torture"?

434
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,180
Aren't the Huayuan women
a little too delicate?

435
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,980
Qianqian is a princess.

436
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,740
She doesn't know how to do housework.

437
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,860
She even burned herself!

438
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,380
But you don't care about her at all!

439
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,620
She got burned?

440
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,140
How did you know that?

441
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,300
I must take her away today!

442
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,500
How do you manage that?

443
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,140
Pretend to be a musician again

444
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,740
and take her away by playing music?

445
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,380
You have no control of any soldier.

446
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,260
You can't even protect yourself,

447
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,060
let alone the person you love!

448
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,700
(Yueli Mansion)

449
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
I'm injured,

450
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,580
yet you are still trying
to consummate our relationship?

451
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,220
Are you an animal?

452
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,980
Why didn't you tell me
that you burned your hand?

453
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,940
Even Pei Heng learned the news before me.

454
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,260
How would it help even if I told you?

455
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,820
You don't care about me anyway.

456
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,380
Plus, I didn't tell Pei Heng about my injury.

457
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,820
Does it hurt?

458
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,100
Yes.

459
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,620
Good that you've applied medicine.

460
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,020
Sleep well.

461
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,460
Don't leave me alone here!

462
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,780
I'll ask Zi Rui to guard you.

463
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,900
I want you to stay with me!

464
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,700
Why didn't you ask me

465
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,540
whether I like sleeping
in bed or on the floor?

466
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,980
Cause I like sleeping in bed.

467
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,860
The floor is too hard.

468
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,820
It's good for your waist.

469
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,260
Are you asleep?

470
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,220
The moon tonight

471
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,820
is as round as the first time when you stayed

472
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,980
in my room.

473
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,700
I'm sorry

474
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,420
that I lied to you.

475
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,500
I know you must be sad.

476
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,860
It'd be good if you are also lying right now.

477
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,380
Mr. Pei, it's a gift from Her Highness!

478
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,700
Playing music

479
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,260
is useless!

480
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,420
I can't even protect the person I love!

481
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,140
You have no control of any soldier.

482
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,100
You can't even protect yourself,

483
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,780
let alone the person you love!

484
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,340
Mother!

485
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,580
Flower token!

486
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,900

Finally your Young Master

got back together with our Crown Princess!

517
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,900
Of course!

518
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,540
Look, how gentle our Young Master is!

519
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,380
When I finish the business here in Huayuan,

520
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,380
I'll take you back to Xuanhu City.

521
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,380
Then could you please stop

522
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
forcing my mother

523
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,500
and drop the plan of conquering Huayuan City?

524
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,540
No!

525
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,500
But, I've agreed

526
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
to go back to Xuanhu with you!

527
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,220
I won't fall

528
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,460
for your honey trap again.

529
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,740
I'll send someone from Xuanhu
to take over Huayuan.

530
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,100
You can just go back to Xuanhu with me

531
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,100
and be my wife.

532
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,100
Huayuan is an inheritance from my ancestors.

533
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,940
My mother exerts her utmost effort
into the city.

534
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,540
How can you ask someone
from Xuanhu to take over it?

535
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,620
She's old now.

536
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,260
It's time for her to abdicate.

537
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,220
Then what about Chuchu?

538
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,580
You were able to come back this time

539
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,220
because Chuchu saved your life!

540
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,260
Are you going to fight against her, too?

541
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,980
Even without the Second Princess,

542
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,740
I'd still be able to get away.

543
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,780
She saved me

544
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,300
because she was going to use me.

545
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
After your mother

546
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,660
issued the abdication decree tomorrow,

547
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,060
they'll all become my prisoners.

548
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,900
Chuchu truly loves you.

549
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,580
But I only care about if you truly love me.

550
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,620
You are so ruthless.

551
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
How would I even dare love you?

552
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,820
Your nature will never change.

553
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,420
What do you mean by "my nature"?

554
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,740
You, Han Shuo,

555
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,180
the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City,

556
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,460
a meticulous man

557
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,020
who's vowed to conquer Huayuan City.

558
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,260
However, due to your heart disease,
you weren't supposed to live long.

559
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,820
Yet you got the Dragon Bone from Huayuan
and cured your disease.

560
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,580
You made yourself a hostage
of Huayuan to spy on us.

561
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,260
You pretended to be sick
while having an evil plan going on.

562
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,460
You are indeed a demon behind the scene.

563
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,900
I wrote three pages about your biography.

564
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,500
I know very well what kind of person you are!

565
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,100
If you are angry, just take it out on me.

566
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,900
Why do you give others a hard time?

567
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,220
Moreover, my mother is old

568
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,060
and she just had a stroke!

569
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,500
So in your eyes,

570
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,420
I only appear to be loyal

571
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,820
but actually I am a wicked
petty man in disguise?

572
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,780
Since I came back,

573
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,740
have you ever asked me

574
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,540
how I have been during the exile?

575
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,460
Have I eaten or slept well?

576
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,980
Yet you care a great deal about your mother.

577
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,820
I just locked her up for only a few days,

578
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,340
and you already see me as your enemy!

579
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,380
You are so good at distinguishing
the close from the distant.

580
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,580
You are jealous of my mother?

581
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,260
Let me ask you.

582
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,140
If your mother and I fell into water
at the same time,

583
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,900
who would you save first?

584
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,300
I can't believe you'd ask me
a fatal question like this!

585
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,900
Sounds like you'd save her first!

586
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,220
Hey, you are a man,

587
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,300
can't you swim?

588
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,700
Why would you fight with a woman?

589
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Now you admit that I'm a man!

590
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,180
I thought men are known

591
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,740
as weak and humble in your Huayuan City.

592
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,740
Since you are worried about your mother

593
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,700
and you are so filial,

594
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,060
she's seriously sick right now,

595
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,580
if you dare disobey me,

596
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
I will end her life early!

597
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,820
I'll go back to the City Owner's Mansion!

598
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,940
Guards!

599
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,140
Zi Rui!

600
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Closely watch Her Highness!

601
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,500
No one is allowed to be in

602
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,820
or out!

603
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,300
Yes!

604
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,500
Let's go!

605
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,180
Look, what a sissy you are!

606
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,580
What are you anxious about?

607
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,740
Our Young Master

608
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,620
won't hurt your Crown Princess!

609
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,820
He was just bluffing.

610
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,100
Couldn't you see that?

611
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Who would expect that the Crown Princess

612
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,180
has quite a quick temper.

613
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,380
You've gone too far!

614
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,180
They haven't even officially remarried yet,

615
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,100
your Young Master already started

616
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220
thinking about seizing

617
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,540
Her Highness' property!

618
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,260
In that case,

619
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,380
Huayuan City will be
part of pre-marital property.

620
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,860
The pre-marital property and marital property

621
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,420
are indivisible!

622
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,740
Who knows if your Young Master

623
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,940
will love another girl after marriage.

624
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,860
If he did, Her Highness would lose
both her husband and money.

625
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,620
But when our Young Master
was sent into exile,

626
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,020
he also lost everything.

627
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,820
In my opinion,

628
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,780
your Huayuan City is much more scheming

629
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,980
and harder to guard against.

630
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,660
I'm not leaving! I'll stay right here.

631
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,500
I'll see what your Young Master

632
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,340
is going to do to our Crown Princess!

633
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,300
Suit yourself!

634
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,340
So? Have you heard anything?

635
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,500
After the Second Princess
took charge of the country affairs,

636
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,140
she used the flower token
to redeploy the City Guards,

637
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,020
but had no intention to save Her Majesty.

638
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,300
As you expected,

639
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,460
there's indeed different voice from the army.

640
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,620
But the Second Princess suppressed it.

641
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,660
If we can get the flower token

642
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,540
and ask the guards
to serve the Crown Princess,

643
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,100
Qianqian will be rescued!

644
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,980
But Mr. Pei, will they listen to you?

645
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,420
After all...

646
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,820
After all, I'm a man, right?

647
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,220
I don't dare!

648
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,300
Gender shouldn't get in the way
of one's future.

649
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,980
I'm a man, so what?

650
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,460
The Minister of Defense has always
come from our Pei family.

651
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,660
My mother was such a prestigious woman.

652
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,740
And I'm her only successor.

653
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,020
Mr. Pei, you are right!

654
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,380
You are a man, so what?

655
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,980
Have you taken care

656
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,940
of the thing I asked?

657
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,300
I've made the arrangement.

658
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,060
But the flower token...

659
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,660
We'll just do our best,

660
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,980
and let fate sort out the rest.

661
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,340
Yes.

662
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,620
(Xingzi Mansion)

663
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,340
Mr. Pei, please follow me.

664
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,700
Mr. Pei,

665
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,140
former Minister Pei once entrusted me

666
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,980
with taking care of
the Second Princess and you.

667
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,860
Me?

668
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
I thought

669
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,660
my mother left the City Guards to Chuchu

670
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,220
because she didn't see me as important.

671
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,020
You were her dearest son.

672
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,460
To her,

673
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,860
you and the Second Princess

674
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,060
were both important.

675
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,420
She was a righteous person and died on duty.

676
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,820
I think she didn't want
to see the Second Princess

677
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,060
betray the City Owner.

678
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,660
I'll lure the Second Princess

679
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,940
to check the flower token later,

680
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,220
and you can take it away from there.

681
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,780
Mother has been sick for days.

682
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,460
I'll ask her

683
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,140
to issue the abdication decree tomorrow,

684
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,820
in case there's any further trouble.

685
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,740
No hurry.

686
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,060
Everything is under our control.

687
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,660
You don't need to worry too much.

688
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,860
Are you hiding something from me?

689
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,580
You and I

690
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,260
are on the same boat now.

691
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,700
Don't worry.

692
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,660
I will help you become the City Owner.

693
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,620
And about the black water mine
we talked about...

694
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,820
Since I promised, I will keep my word.

695
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,060
Good!

696
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,380
Young Master,

697
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,140
I'm taking a lot of risks

698
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,940
working with you this time.

699
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,580
But I'm different from Qianqian.

700
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,460
My feelings to you...

701
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,500
Her Highness! Her Highness!

702
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,580
What is it?

703
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,660
The City Guards caught a theft,

704
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,740
who was trying to steal the flower token!

705
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
Steal the flower token?

706
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Since you have something urgent came up,

707
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,820
I'll see myself out.

708
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,300
You can leave. I'll be there soon.

709
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,460
Yes.

710
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,220
Mr. Pei,

711
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,740
this is the military camp.

712
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,420
Trespassing on the military camp
is a capital offense!

713
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,140
I wouldn't be here in the middle of night

714
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,940
if it wasn't for an emergency!

715
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,940
Here is the flower token!

716
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,300
City Guards, listen up!

717
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,300
I order you to follow my lead.

718
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,580
In the battle tomorrow
at the City Owner's Mansion,

719
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,460
you will surrender to the Crown Princess,
rescue Her Majesty,

720
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
and fight Han Shuo to the death!

721
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,660
Mr. Pei,

722
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,660
I thought you came here this late

723
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,260
for something important,

724
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,380
but it turns out you were here
to tell us a joke!

725
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,380
When have City Guards ever knelt to men?

726
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,980
As a man,

727
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,780
you want to lead the army?

728
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,740
How funny!

729
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,060
This is Huayuan City, not Xuanhu!

730
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,940
Men can never

731
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,260
call the shots!

732
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,580
Don't you think, everybody?

733
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,380
That's right!

734
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,380
It doesn't matter it's Xuanhu

735
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,660
or Huayuan.

736
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,500
I have the flower token.

737
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,260
Whatever I say should be
considered military command!

738
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,340
When my mother Pei Wujiang was alive,

739
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,020
she promised Her Majesty

740
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,380
that the City Guards
would defend her to the death.

741
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,260
And now Her Majesty is in trouble,

742
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,620
yet you wanna break your promise?

743
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,020
The important positions of the City Guards

744
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,420
have never been assigned to men.

745
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
You think

746
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,460
you can order us around
with a piece of token?

747
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,340
Guys, let's go!

748
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,860
The Minister of Defense
has always come from the Pei family.

749
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,620
Although I'm a man,

750
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,300
my family name is Pei;

751
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,340
I also have the guts and courage
of the City Guards!

752
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,580
She deserved to die!

753
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,180
And who wanna die next?

754
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,940
Well...

755
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,980
Listen up, City Guards!

756
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
The City Owner and the Crown Princess
are in danger.

757
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,740
Assemble all troops

758
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,020
and enter the city to rescue them!

759
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,140
-Yes!
-Yes!

760
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,620
What should I do?

761
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,140
Will I be locked up here by Han Shuo

762
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,580
till the ending?

763
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,460
But with mother's personality,

764
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
it's unlikely that she'll compromise
with Han Shuo and Chuchu.

765
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,780
What if they had a conflict
and ended up fighting each other?

766
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,140
No, I have to sort it out.

767
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,060
Xiaoqian, you've written so many major scenes

768
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,180
and you've experienced a lot,

769
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,260
but why would you chicken out
in front of swords?

770
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,500
Qianqian,

771
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,340
I'm here to save you!

772
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,500
You said

773
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,660
that I'd become

774
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,460
the first male Minister of Defense.

775
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,540
And I did it!

776
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,300
Sorry!

777
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,380
It's not your fault!

778
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,300
It's just I can't be who I used to be.

779
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,660
I must get the power

780
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,860
so that I can protect you!
