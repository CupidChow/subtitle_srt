=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 1)

24
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,180
(Huayuan City)

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,000
Women had a decisive say in Huayuan City

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,670
while men had it in Xuanhu City.

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,470
The two cities had always been at odds.

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,840
Xuanhu was defeated

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
after a fierce battle,

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,760
so their Young Master Han Shuo had to marry

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,110
into Huayuan City and live there.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,520
I heard Xuanhu City's Young Master

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,110
will marry one of our princesses.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,030
I wonder which one will marry him.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,160
Men have the decisive say in Xuanhu City,

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,030
but in Huayuan City,

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,150
women are superior to men.

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,350
Our officials are women.

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,920
Our City Owner is a woman.

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,920
All men are boors

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,670
and know nothing about high-quality life.

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,670
Look at them.

43
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,710
To get the black stone mine,

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,440
they even agreed to send their
Young Master here as a hostage.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,510
Look.

46
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,550
He's a handsome young man.

47
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,190
Pitifully, he has a heart disease.

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,830
All doctors said that

49
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,080
he couldn't live to 20.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,920
He's going to be 19.

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,080
Why did Xuanhu City

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,440
send a dying guy here?

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,830
It bodes ill.

54
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,080
Let's go.

55
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,510
Move away.

56
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,360
Get lost. You. All of you get lost.

57
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,550
Get her. Move away.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,150
Get out of the way.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,790
the Dragon Bone was
Huayuan City's rare treasure.

60
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,320
It could cure all diseases
and it was the only one of its kind.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,830
The main reason why Han Shuo agreed
to marry into Huayuan City

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,350
was to get the Dragon Bone.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,510
To reach his goal,

64
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,990
he tried to get Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess
of Huayuan City, into trouble,

65
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,200
so that he could save her

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
and she'd fall in love with him.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,840
After that, he'd use her
to get the Dragon Bone.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,240
Who are you?

69
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,680
Han Shuo, the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,070
You're the one

71
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,240
who'll marry into Huayuan City?

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,600
You're good-looking.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
Clean him up

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,960
and send him to my mansion tonight.

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,400
Your Highness,

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,510
his marriage to you
needs approval from your mother.

77
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,430
Taking him back like this...

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,910
...is against the rules.

79
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,240
If your mother knows about it...

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,710
Since my childhood,
there has been nothing I can't get.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,990
The Third princess?

82
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,760
He's just the Young Master of Xuanhu City.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm going to ask for my mother's
permission to marry him.

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,270
There is no time like the present.

85
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,150
I'll marry him tomorrow.

86
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,960
May I know who you are?

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm the Third Princess of Huayuan City.

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,070
Chen Qianqian.

89
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,710
Third...

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,240
What to do?

91
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,680
Young Master.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,840
Are you having a heart attack again?

93
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,150
Take the medicine.

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,910
What's wrong?

95
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,320
Hold on.

96
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,760
Take your time.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,720
I've had heart disease since my childhood.
I often suffer from heart attacks.

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,680
Doctors said I'll die at 20.

99
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm afraid our Young Master
doesn't have the luck to stay with you.

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,350
Please take back your words.

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,310
It's something about the two cities.

102
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,280
It'll be terrible if he dies.

103
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,680
You're terminally ill?

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,120
In this case,

105
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,510
take him to my mansion

106
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,960
while he's still alive.

107
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,680
Wait.

108
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,720
As the saying goes,

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,790
We need to give it a go at least.

111
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,960
Cut the crap.

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,720
Get prepared when you arrive
at the post house.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,070
I'll marry you tomorrow.

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,590
Count yourself unlucky

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
to meet me.

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,720
Your Highness.

117
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,240
Your Highness.

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,160
Obviously, she's taking him
for marriage by force.

119
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,590
Oh no. He's going to marry the Third Princess.

120
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,190
She's the greatest evildoer.

121
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,790
She's spoiled by her mother.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Look. The young man is in poor health.

123
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,440
I wonder how long he can survive

124
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
if he stays with the Third Princess.

125
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
I bet he'll die soon.

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
Let's go.

127
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
Alright. Go back.

128
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,900
(Posthouse)

129
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,240
Young Master,

130
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,030
it's beyond our expectations.

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,190
Rumor has it that

132
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,840
Chen Qianqian is unreasonable and ridiculous.

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,310
And she has no regard for laws.

134
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,750
She is illiterate

135
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
and she suffers from Princess Syndrome.

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
She even ordered everyone in the city

137
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,680
to treat her as a princess of the first rank.

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,910
Princess of the first rank?

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,470
A city is too small for her, right?

140
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,960
But I remember clearly

141
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
I told them to frighten the horse of

142
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,590
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

143
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,560
Why was it Chen Qianqian?

144
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,880
What to do?

145
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,630
Young Master.

146
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,000
Act according to circumstances.

147
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,340
(Han Shuo calmly said:
Act according to circumstances.)

148
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,840
The hero saved the wrong person

149
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,120
and the hero was taken for marriage
by the female supporting role.

150
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,910
I'm such a talented screenwriter

151
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,590
to create such an interesting story.

152
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
("The Tiger Sniffing the Rose",
third draft of Episode 1)

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,260
(Available balance: 573 yuan)

154
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,820
(Available balance: 573 yuan)

155
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,160
When will they transfer money
for the script to me?

156
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,510
Mr. Zhang.

157
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,310
Xiaoqian,

158
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,720
as for this script,

159
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,680
it can't be finalized for now.

160
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,960
I see. I'd like to know...

161
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,310
The hero

162
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,440
Mr. Han said

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,470
he has some questions about it.

164
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,470
Can you go there and communicate with him?

165
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,630
As long as you convince him,

166
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,630
we can begin the shooting.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
Okay. I'd like to ask you about...

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,560
...the money for the script.

169
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,720
Who will pay me?

170
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,070
Everyone, please step back.

171
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,280
Don't push.

172
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,680
Don't bother them while they're working.

173
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,840
We're here!

174
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,470
Hi, Mr. Han.

175
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,910
I'm the screenwriter
of "The Tiger Sniffing the Rose",

176
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,680
Chen Xiaoqian.

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,590
-Hi. -Hi.

178
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,910
I'll make a long story short.

179
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,120
I've read the script.

180
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,590
I think something is wrong with the hero

181
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,400
Han Shuo's character set.

182
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
I see. What do you think... Mr. Han?

183
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
Can you tell me what you think is wrong?

184
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,400
Mr. Han.

185
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,240
What do you think is wrong?

186
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,560
Mr. Han, what's wrong with the character set?

187
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,120
Can you tell me what are Han Shuo's
motives for doing that?

188
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,310
As for his motives,

189
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,470
he wanted to get the Dragon Bone,

190
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,190
Huayuan City's most precious treasure.

191
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,510
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

192
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,590
Han Shuo had heart disease
from his childhood.

193
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,030
He often had heart attacks.

194
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,440
Only the Dragon Bone could cure him.

195
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,030
So, Han Shuo agreed
to marry into Huayuan City

196
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,680
in order to get the Dragon Bone.

197
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,790
In the end, he was killed by Chen Chuchu.

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,790
Okay. Lift up.

199
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,320
It's just that a hero
often falls for a beauty.

200
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,350
That's the problem.

201
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,760
Why did Han Shuo

202
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,000
fall in love with Chen Chuchu suddenly?

203
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,710
Just because she's the heroine?

204
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,030
Excuse me. Okay.

205
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,390
Well. Mr. Han. Look.

206
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,830
Okay. Lift up.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,520
Because the heroine is clever,

208
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,830
quick-witted, beautiful and kind-hearted.

209
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,030
Isn't that enough?

210
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,790
Okay. Go refine his make-up.

211
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,590
No.

212
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
A healthy relationship is based on equality.

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,150
People in Huayuan City
think men have to obey women.

214
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,080
It's quite the opposite
for people in Xuanhu City.

215
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,590
Such being the case,

216
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,120
I don't think Han Shuo would fall in love
with a woman from Huayuan.

217
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,910
Besides,

218
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:49,910
Han Shuo is kind of

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,760
a male chauvinist.

220
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,520
A male chauvinist?

221
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,790
Do you think we're equal?

222
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,350
Okay. Down.

223
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,710
If two people are not equal,

224
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,150
they couldn't even communicate,

225
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,470
let alone fall in love.

226
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,000
Just like you and me.

227
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,590
Will you fall in love with me?

228
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,120
As for the feminism expressed in your script,

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,880
in my opinion,

230
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
it's not different

231
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
from the male chauvinism you criticized.

232
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
The equality you look forward to

233
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
is not real equality.

234
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,020
What you...

235
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,440
Madam, you've never entered
a relationship, right?

236
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,910
Get into a relationship if you have time.

237
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,030
Then you'll be able to

238
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,200
write a better love story.

239
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,240
Get started.

240
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,470
Okay. Got it.

241
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,950
Up.

242
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,030
Okay. Lift up.

243
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,470
Mr. Zhang, I tried my best to cooperate,

244
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,440
but it was impossible
to communicate with him.

245
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,590
He flew away every time
I wanted to say something.

246
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,270
I've even got a hoarse voice,

247
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,470
but he wouldn't listen to me.

248
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,200
Xiaoqian...

249
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Hold on.

250
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,880
I think he's insane.

251
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,500
(Get-rich-quick)

252
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,660
(Available balance: 27.573 yuan)

253
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,520
Hello? Mr. Zhang.

254
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,120
Xiaoqian.

255
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
I thought about it carefully.

256
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,080
Go ahead.

257
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,710
I'm too young.

258
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,790
I should've kept my bad mood
from affecting my work.

259
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,200
Right.

260
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
Trust me.

261
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,640
As for the issues Mr. Han mentioned,

262
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,880
I'll correct them all.

263
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,680
The shooting won't be postponed.

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,520
Trust me.

265
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Tens of thousands.

266
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,200
It's just about relationships.

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
It's just about equality.

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,790
Let me show you

269
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,030
what an excellent screenwriter can do.

270
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,120
Han Shuo killed Chen Qianqian
and then deceived Chen Chuchu.

271
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,390
After being treated with the Dragon Bone,
he began to rebel.

272
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,470
He conquered Huayuan,

273
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,240
killed the City Owner
and slaughtered the common people.

274
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,390
He turned hostile all of a sudden.

275
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,590
Han Shuo,

276
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,470
I've never doubted you.

277
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,030
Han Shuo,

278
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,910
I've never doubted you,

279
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,950
but you're so cruel.

280
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,950
You're so cruel as to treat me like that.

281
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,240
Chuchu,

282
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
when I become the City Owner,

283
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,790
you can continue to be my wife.

284
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,710
Asshole.

285
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,150
No way.

286
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't write like this.

287
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,440
Han Shuo really fell in love

288
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,760
with Chen Chuchu

289
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
after starting it as a lie.

290
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,950
He conquered Huayuan,

291
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,950
but he let Chuchu go.

292
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,880
After she escaped,

293
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
Chuchu endured hardships to plan retaliation.

294
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,000
In the end, they had to
have a decisive battle.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,640
They loved and hated each other.
It's sad and weepy.

296
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,120
I can't write like this.

297
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,900
(Men in Xuanhu City can sleep with Kriegie
after winning, so can women in Huayuan City.)

298
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,680
I can't write a beautiful love story
because I've never got in a relationship?

299
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,760
What a joke!

300
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,390
I can't catch a cold.

301
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,030
I haven't finished the script.

302
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,320
Chen Chuchu, the Second Princess
of Huayuan City,

303
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,950
finally became the City Owner

304
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,200
after going through hardships and setbacks.

305
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,200
At her enthronement ceremony,

306
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,950
the sun and the moon were up
in the sky at the same time.

307
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,350
The gate to Heaven was wide open

308
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,790
and radiant splendor appeared.

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,250
(The final episode)

310
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm sleepy.

311
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,120
It's hard to be a screenwriter.

312
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,760
I had a good sleep
just because the script was done.

313
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,380
(Supreme gourmet roast whole lamb)

314
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,780
(Crystal clear jade-like celadon decanter)

315
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,780
(The famous painting of grass and bamboo)

316
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Chen Xiaoqian.

317
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,080
What did you do?

318
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,150
You just got paid

319
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,910
and you dared to come to a nightclub for fun?

320
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,320
And you even did cos-play.

321
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,910
Get up. Hurry.

322
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,560
Her Highness woke up.
She's dashing wine glasses.

323
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,680
Whatever. I've spent lots of money anyway.

324
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,910
I don't care.

325
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,710
It must be expensive.

326
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,640
Your Highness, let us pay
our respects to you.

327
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,120
Thank you for your patronage.

328
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,000
What's your price?

329
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,910
For me, it's 1,000 taels of gold per song.

330
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,030
900 for me.

331
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,350
800 for me.

332
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,880
But Your Highness,

333
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,640
you can get all this for free.

334
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,390
For free?

335
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,950
Well. What did you call me just now?

336
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,320
Your Highness?

337
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,830
Your... Highness?

338
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,080
Let me have a look.

339
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,830
What a coincidence.

340
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,390
A lotus bracelet with a small bell.

341
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,760
This is a kind of special
accessory of musicians

342
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,350
in the Music and Dance Academy in my script.

343
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,830
Could it be

344
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,080
here is...

345
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,830
Your Highness.

346
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,220
(The East Wind Sends Its Regards)

347
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,710
This dream looks familiar.

348
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,550
I wrote it?

349
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh no.

350
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,550
I'm trapped in the script I wrote.

351
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,240
My script tells

352
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,640
a story that happened in Huayuan City,

353
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,880
a place where women had the decisive say.

354
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,310
In Huayuan City,

355
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,590
women enjoyed higher status

356
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,590
than men.

357
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,240
If a couple had a baby girl,
they'd be wild with joy.

358
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,950
Congratulations.

359
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,550
It's a baby girl.

360
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,040
A baby boy again.

361
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,190
You good-for-nothing.

362
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,190
Do you want me to die without descendants?

363
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,240
In Huayuan City,

364
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,400
both civil and military officials

365
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,040
were women.

366
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,350
Men couldn't secure an official position.

367
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,710
And they didn't have the right
to be educated.

368
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,350
Want to study? In your dreams.

369
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
You'd better think about
marrying into a rich family.

370
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,280
Go. Get to work.

371
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,350
Hurry.

372
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,710
Innocence is a virtue for men.

373
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,000
There were five social classes: scholars,
farmers, artisans, merchants and men,

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,120
ranked in descending order.

375
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,670
-It can be said that, -He shirked at work,

376
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,350
-men were at the bottom of the social ladder.
-discipline him better at home.

377
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
So little?

378
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,520
You...

379
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,710
I'll teach you a good lesson
after we go back.

380
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,710
In Huayuan City,

381
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,040
all singers and dancers

382
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,800
were men.

383
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,550
Come on.

384
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,800
Sell it to me.

385
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,710
You have good skin.

386
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,660
(The Music and Dance Academy)

387
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,830
I can't believe I became
the Third Princess of Huayuan City,

388
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Chen Qianqian.

389
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,950
The one who called herself
the princess of the first rank.

390
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,980
(Debauchery)

391
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,020
(Luxury and Extravagance)

392
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,380
(Ignorant and Incompetent)

393
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,760
The one who took Han Shuo
for marriage by force

394
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,800
and was poisoned by him

395
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,310
on their wedding night.

396
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
The cameo role who died in the third episode.

397
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,430
Which episode is it?

398
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,000
Which episode?

399
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,310
Well. I meant

400
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,350
what's the situation now.

401
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,470
Situation?

402
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,590
What does she mean?

403
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
Your Highness.

404
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,710
Your Highness.

405
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,800
Your wedding dress is sent here.

406
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,400
What?

407
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,190
Your Highness,

408
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,950
you're getting married today.

409
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,240
We worked against the clock

410
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,400
to complete the embroidered
wedding dress in time.

411
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,950
Please try it on to see if it fits you.

412
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
Episode three?

413
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,350
I'm telling you.

414
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,670
Take it away now.

415
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
This is not a wedding dress,
but a mourning dress.

416
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Besides, I won't marry Han Shuo.

417
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,400
He's a jinx.

418
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,830
I have to stay away from him.

419
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,640
Take it away.

420
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,520
But it...

421
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,420
(Posthouse)

422
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,820
(Wedding Procession)

423
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,880
Young Master,

424
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,040
the wedding procession has been
staying at the gate since last night.

425
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,190
They said they're here to protect us,

426
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,800
but actually, they're keeping eyes on us.

427
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,000
I've been waiting here for a long time

428
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,880
under the order of your father.

429
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,920
Young Master, she's one of us.

430
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,520
What on earth has happened?

431
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,240
Why did something unforeseen happen

432
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,670
once you entered the city?

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,830
I...

434
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,430
I was ordered by Young Master Han

435
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,280
to get close to
the Second Princess Chen Chuchu,

436
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,240
since she's the best candidate

437
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,280
for the City Owner

438
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,120
in the minds of the common people
and officials.

439
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,280
Only through getting close to her
can we get the Dragon Bone

440
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,880
to cure Young Master Han.

441
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,950
But unexpectedly,

442
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,710
it was Chen Qianqian's horse

443
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
that got frightened.

444
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,470
Young Master Han saved the wrong person

445
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,670
and hit her fancy.

446
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,590
It seems that someone doesn't want me

447
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,400
to have anything to do with Chen Chuchu.

448
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,310
I guess someone let it happen on purpose.

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,830
Young Master,

450
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,640
is it the City Owner of Huayuan?

451
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,350
Nothing is known yet.

452
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,040
I showed weakness by pretending
to have heart attacks.

453
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,400
I hope people here

454
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,120
can lower their guard.

455
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,800
Young Master, please don't worry.

456
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,550
As long as you give an order,

457
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,710
all secret spies hidden in Huayuan City

458
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,160
will keep you safe

459
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,470
and stop the Third Princess having her way.

460
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,800
Here. Have a look. It's cheap.

461
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,070
Young Master, are you okay?

462
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,190
It doesn't matter.

463
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
I won't have a heart attack that easily.

464
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,040
What shall we do next?

465
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,710
Push the boat along with the current.

466
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,880
Now that the Third Princess
is eager to marry me,

467
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,550
let's do as she wishes.

468
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,400
I'll poison Chen Qianqian tonight

469
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,760
to get rid of her.

470
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,000
Then we'll go with the original plan,

471
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,350
help Chen Chuchu succeed her mother

472
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
and use her to get the Dragon Bone.

473
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,040
When I get Huayuan's rare treasure

474
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,520
and my heart disease is cured,

475
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,950
I'll light up the fire beacons
on the lookout tower.

476
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,040
Then our armies will be sent here

477
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,880
to conquer Huayuan City.

478
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,310
Young Master, you're so wise.

479
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,070
Kill all those
who failed their work this time.

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,880
Young Master,

481
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,550
we're in the enemy camp.
We may get into trouble anytime.

482
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,190
Please think it over

483
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,710
and give those who made mistakes,

484
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,470
especially me,

485
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,920
a chance to make amends.

486
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,640
Then find out the chief culprit of

487
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,070
this accident.

488
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,520
Kill him as a warning to others.

489
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,760
Yes, Young Master!

490
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,520
Young Master,

491
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,950
the chief culprit has been killed.

492
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,880
You...

493
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,190
Who told you to kill the horse?

494
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,280
He had the horse killed?

495
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,520
It's a warning to me.

496
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,160
I'll be the next one.

497
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,040
Xuanhu?

498
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
A small city

499
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,920
at the border.

500
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,550
They even sent their Young Master here

501
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,240
as a hostage.

502
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,040
There is nothing to be afraid of.

503
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,070
Han Shuo is seriously ill.

504
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,550
Obviously, he's a worthless person.

505
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,240
He could only vent his anger on a horse.

506
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
In the end,

507
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
he'll be ordered about by you.

508
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,550
At the border?

509
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,310
A small city?

510
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,550
Worthless?

511
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,040
Ordered about by me?

512
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm telling you.

513
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,000
If you want to survive,

514
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
never say those words
in the presence of Han Shuo.

515
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,070
Of course I won't.

516
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,520
In case

517
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,280
I really offend Han Shuo,

518
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,070
you'll keep me safe, right?

519
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,430
I can't even keep myself safe,

520
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,670
let alone you.

521
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
If I do as the plot says,

522
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,120
drink the poisoned wine on our wedding night

523
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,160
and die,

524
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,590
will I wake up?

525
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,920
Your Highness,

526
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,800
let me tell you

527
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,240
about the procedures
of your wedding ceremony.

528
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,280
Listen carefully.

529
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,240
You don't like these unnecessary formalities,

530
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,310
but it's a different case this time.

531
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,310
Since your mother got married,

532
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,160
no wedding ceremonies have been held

533
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,280
for over 30 years in Huayuan City.

534
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,520
This time, you'll marry
the Young Master of Xuanhu.

535
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,640
The ceremony will be grander.

536
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,350
I don't want to mention
anything else for now.

537
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,470
Just the flower parade

538
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,040
will include 64 horses...

539
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,470
You're Zi Rui, right?

540
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,000
To reach the necessary word count,

541
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,590
I gave you lots of lines.

542
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,070
Will you always be a chatter-box?

543
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,190
I'm telling you.

544
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,070
From now on,

545
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,710
you can say no more than
ten characters each time.

546
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,400
But...

547
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,470
Tell me about the procedures.
In ten characters.

548
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,400
Flower parade.

549
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,070
With the Second Princess.

550
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,470
Cancel the flower parade. I'm not going.

551
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,430
What?

552
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,240
Your Highness,

553
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
it's unprecedented.

554
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
I'm telling you.

555
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,470
What matters the most

556
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,880
is to marry Han Shuo.

557
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,830
Except for drinking "cross-cupped" wine,

558
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,430
everything else can be cancelled.

559
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,760
Then how will we explain it

560
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,800
to your mother and your sister?

561
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,640
It's easy.

562
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,800
Just tell them I'm burning with anxiety.

563
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,760
I can't wait to celebrate
the wedding with Han Shuo.

564
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,190
What?

565
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,070
The flower parade is cancelled?

566
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,400
Your Highness,

567
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,310
it's said that Han Shuo is eager to

568
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,800
celebrate the wedding
with the Third Princess.

569
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
Everyone thinks

570
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,950
the Third Princess
was the one who can't wait.

571
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,950
Zi Zhu,

572
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,000
Qianqian is my younger sister.

573
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,190
Stop discussing her without respect.

574
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
Please forgive me.

575
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,920
It couldn't be better

576
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,070
if Han Shuo is the right guy for her.

577
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,070
In this case,

578
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Qianqian will be more mature.

579
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,160
Young...

580
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,000
Young Master.

581
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,430
The poison is called "Soul Missing Powder."

582
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,190
It's colorless and odorless
after dissolving in water.

583
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,040
Victims will die a sudden death
during their sleep,

584
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,550
before anyone else knows it.

585
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,640
Trust me.

586
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,550
No matter how they investigate it,

587
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,590
they couldn't think
it has anything to do with you.

588
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,920
There is one more thing.

589
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,550
I heard

590
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,590
Chen Qianqian's only strength is

591
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,880
that she's good at Kung Fu.

592
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,430
Take this with you,

593
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,950
just in case.

594
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,120
If anything happens,

595
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,670
you can prevent yourself being hurt.

596
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,430
If something really happens
between her and me tonight,

597
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,520
who do you think will be hurt?

598
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,550
I've thought too much.

599
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,190
Chen Qianqian is brutal and domineering,

600
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,760
but her mother is indulgent with her.

601
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,400
Tonight,

602
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
I have to kill her.

603
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,920
Young Master, you're wise.

604
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
Young Master,

605
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
the Third Princess just ordered

606
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,000
to cancel the flower parade.

607
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,070
What?

608
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,400
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

609
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,430
Young Master Han deserves the grandest reception.

610
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,350
How can she cancel it at will?

611
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,520
The Third Princess also asked us

612
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,710
to take Young Master Han to Yueli Mansion directly

613
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,000
so that they can celebrate
the wedding immediately.

614
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,190
Young Master Han, this way please.

615
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,280
Ridiculous.

616
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,280
Outrageous.

617
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,590
How can a bride be so impatient?

618
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,710
Bai Ji,

619
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,310
let's do as Her Highness said.

620
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,710
Young Master.

621
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,000
What's the next procedure?

622
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,550
Offering sacrifice to Heaven.

623
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,550
Praying for permanent peace.

624
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,280
Don't bother.

625
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,760
I don't need to tell God I'm getting married.

626
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,800
Cancel it.

627
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Take him here directly.

628
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,640
The Third Princess and our Young Master

629
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,430
had been engaged to each other
in their childhood.

630
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,590
How can she marry the Young Master of Xuanhu

631
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,040
and make our Young Master lose face?

632
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,550
What will he do

633
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,950
now that she's married?

634
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,350
Lower your voice.

635
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't let him hear it.

636
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,880
You know,

637
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,120
he hates it the most

638
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,800
when we mention his engagement
to the Third Princess.

639
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
It doesn't matter.

640
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,880
I heard Young Master Han had heart disease

641
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
and couldn't live to 20.

642
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,350
Our Young Master can afford to wait.

643
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,710
He'll survive that guy.

644
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,040
Minister Pei,

645
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,880
The Third Princess asked me to tell you

646
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,950
she'll keep everything simple
for her wedding.

647
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,240
Sacrifice to Heaven

648
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,590
will be cancelled.

649
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,120
So, the prayer for the ceremony will...

650
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,160
Okay. I see.

651
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,400
Don't you want to know why?

652
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,800
The Third Princess is unlearned
and ignores rites.

653
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,350
Now that she wants to cancel it, let it go.

654
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,880
It can save me the trouble
of praising her in the article.

655
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,240
I'll take my leave.

656
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,520
What's the next procedure?

657
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Go to see the City Owner,
that is, your mother.

658
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,950
Cancel it.

659
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,880
Your Majesty.

660
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,760
What's up?

661
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,070
The Third Princess passed on a message.

662
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,190
She said you have to attend
to numerous affairs every day,

663
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,520
so she wouldn't bother you
with a petty thing like getting married.

664
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,590
She's running wild.

665
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,590
I also thought it was improper.

666
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,950
I've sent someone to her mansion.

667
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,470
She's been arrogant
and willful since childhood.

668
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,800
She's even more self-willed.

669
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Your Majesty.

670
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,310
Perhaps the Third Princess

671
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,190
just thinks the formalities are unnecessary.

672
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,800
Fine.

673
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,590
Let her cancel it.

674
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
It's no big deal.

675
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

676
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,880
This Young Master Han

677
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,950
is in poor health,

678
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,520
and the Third Princess

679
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,190
is not that thoughtful.

680
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,400
What if anything happens

681
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,240
and Han Shuo fails to tough it out?

682
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,520
Leave it to fate.

683
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,040
Just consider as that Qianqian helps me out.

684
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,420
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

685
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,670
You'll get a divorce in the following cases:
you're not obedient to the in-laws;

686
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,550
you fail to have a female heir;

687
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,830
you have an affair;

688
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,310
you're jealous...

689
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,800
You contract infectious disease;

690
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,760
you're a big mouth and love to gossip;

691
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,350
you're against rules and regulations.

692
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
The seven conditions are the seven grounds

693
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,950
for lawfully divorcing a man in Huayuan City.

694
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,670
I've remembered them.

695
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,400
Young Master...

696
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,880
This is also a custom in Huayuan City.

697
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
The bridegroom will follow the one

698
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,950
who takes off his veil

699
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,350
on the wedding night.

700
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,550
It'll be considered unchaste
if he follows someone else.

701
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,040
As for this,

702
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,520
I can comply with it too.

703
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,470
Absurd.

704
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
How dare you

705
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,400
ask men to follow these rules?

706
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,880
The status of women in Xuanhu City

707
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,830
is the status of men

708
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,280
in Huayuan City.

709
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,160
You bi...

710
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,950
Bai Ji,

711
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,040
when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

712
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,590
What is it?

713
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,120
Gecko cinnabar.

714
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,520
How dare you?

715
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,640
I decided to get married
to the Third Princess

716
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,310
to ease the relationship

717
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,040
between Xuanhu and Huayuan.

718
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,950
As for men's virtues and the veil,

719
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,470
I've tried my best to be tolerant.

720
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,470
But you're pressing at every stage.

721
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,000
You're...

722
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,070
You're going too far in bullying them.

723
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,120
Young Master.

724
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,400
Why bother with the gecko cinnabar?

725
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,240
Even if you leave a red mark now,

726
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,920
it'll be gone after I sleep with him tonight.

727
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,640
There is no point of doing that.

728
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,190
You're right, Your Highness.

729
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,710
I'm leaving.

730
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,920
Young Master Han.

731
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,670
Young Master.

732
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,430
I'm not leaving.

733
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,870
Young Master Han, shall we go through the motions

734
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,800
or

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,560
get right to the point?

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
It's our wedding night.

737
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,150
How could we not drink to add to the fun?

738
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
(Make Chen Qianqian drink the poisoned wine
on the wedding night.)

739
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,300
(... the poisoned wine)

740
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,080
"Cross-cupped" wine.

741
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,800
I need to pay attention to my posture

742
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,560
to drink the poisoned wine.

743
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,110
Qianqian,

744
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,390
we met each other yesterday

745
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,040
and we got married today.

746
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,520
I hope we can support each other

747
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,040
and share joys and hardships together.

748
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,390
Fine.

749
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,710
In this case, I can go home soon.

750
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,040
Cheers.

751
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
What's the matter?

752
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,280
I'm sorry

753
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,950
for having your spirits dampened.

754
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,280
Sorry.

755
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,280
Let's do it again.

756
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,430
Cheers.

757
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,000
What's wrong this time?

758
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,360
Isn't it a posture

759
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,950
people in Xuanhu are used to?

760
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,870
You want to take the veil off, right?

761
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,280
So much trouble.

762
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,910
Why is it tied so tight?

763
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,360
Why is it you?

764
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,950
Didn't you say you don't want to act as him?

765
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

766
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,560
Could it be that

767
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
you think I poisoned your wine?

768
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,630
As for this matter,

769
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,560
you know it best.

770
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,280
Drop the act.

771
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,040
Fine. It's not poisoned, right?

772
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,560
Okay. Pick one. Let's drink it up.

773
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Let me tell you the truth.

774
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,950
Even if I die today,

775
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,280
I'll take you with me.

776
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Servants!

777
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,600
Here.

778
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,600
I don't want to talk to you.

779
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,280
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

780
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,710
Lift him up.

781
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,280
He likes to stay in the air.

782
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,910
Lift him up?

783
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,520
Your Highness,

784
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
today is your wedding day.

785
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,760
Don't make trouble,

786
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,150
or your mother will be worried.

787
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,240
Please think it over.

788
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,840
She'll be worried
even if I don't make trouble.

789
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,560
Besides, I didn't aim to do that,

790
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,800
but, he wanted to poison me.

791
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,560
Your Highness, why are you saying that?

792
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,800
You don't believe?

793
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,110
You don't believe, right?

794
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,670
Fine. Let me prove it to you.

795
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,150
The two poisoned glasses
of wine are evidence.

796
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,630
I'm telling you.

797
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,950
If I die today,

798
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,280
you couldn't survive.

799
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,520
You poisoned the dishes, right?

800
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Good idea.

801
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,360
Great.

802
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,110
Your Highness,

803
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,240
what are you doing?

804
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,520
I'd like to see where else
you can hide the poison.

805
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Salty.

806
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,150
Did he smear it on his lips?

807
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,760
It turns out you're a drama king.

808
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,630
You!

809
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,190
Tell me

810
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,760
if I'm bound to die.

811
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,150
Yes, definitely.

812
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,600
Zi Rui,

813
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,110
if I die,

814
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,630
tear his body up by five horses and implicate
the nine generations of his family.

815
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,520
Got it?

816
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,840
Young Master Han, why don't you explain to her?

817
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,520
Don't listen to him.

818
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,320
I...

819
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,390
Zi Rui,

820
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,950
so many of you

821
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,910
are waggling here before my eyes.

822
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,710
I feel the poison

823
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,080
has attacked my brain.

824
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm dying.

825
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,240
I can't control my tongue.

826
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,150
Oh no. My head is spinning.

827
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,360
I need to sit down.

828
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,390
Let me lie down for a while.

829
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,600
Your poison has a strong delayed effect.

830
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,710
Go get the doctor!

831
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,360
Young Master.

832
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,520
