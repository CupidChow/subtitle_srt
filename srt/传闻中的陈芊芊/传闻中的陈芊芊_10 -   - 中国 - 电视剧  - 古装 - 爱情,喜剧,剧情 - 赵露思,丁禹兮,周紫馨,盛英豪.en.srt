=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 10)

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Lin Qi fears rats the most.

25
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,740
So I put 27 rats into her chamber.

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,340
I'll see what she will look like tomorrow.

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,940
She wanted to beat me?

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,020
Lin Qi is no match for me at all.

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,860
I will scare her to death.

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,900
How do you feel now? Are you still angry?

31
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,140
It is avenging you on her,

32
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,820
not me.

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,540
It was a competition.

34
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,860
We have signed a disclaimer.

35
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,700
We can't seek revenge.

36
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,540
I don't like fighting and killing.

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,100
Your Highness is so kind.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,500
Kind?

39
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,300
I'd rather say Her Highness is so mean.

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,860
I caught 27 rats for her.

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,380
It made me exhausted.

42
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,460
At least Her Highness is kinder

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,620
than Young Master Han.

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,460
Young Master Han and the Third Princess,

45
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,620
one is ruthless and the other is mean.

46
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,940
They are well matched.

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,660
Zi Rui. Let's go.

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,300
OK.

49
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,180
It is my negligence.

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,580
There is an escaped...rat.

51
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,140
Hey, take it away

52
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,860
from me, Bai Ji.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
Farther away.

54
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,420
Go. Zi Rui. Go.

55
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,260
Young Master.

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,220
Please give me a chance
to make up for my mistake.

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,180
Not necessary.

58
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,980
I will reward you.

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,180
But...

60
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
(City Owner's Mansion)

61
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,340
The third test. Discourse on politics.

62
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,780
This time, the question is
about current politics.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,540
Now, in Huayuan City,

64
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,900
the silver reserve is decreasing
and financial condition is bad.

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,700
Would you please tell me

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,140
if you have any good advice
on increasing revenue?

67
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,740
Mother, I have a piece of good advice.

68
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,980
Tell me.

69
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,060
We could increase head tax.

70
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,500
First, this tax can guarantee
financial income.

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,580
Second, it can control population,

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
so that population will not
increase too quickly

73
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,020
and become a burden on the economy.

74
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,380
As far as I know,

75
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,620
Huayuan City has a total
population of 150,000,

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,820
in which 105,000 are adults.

77
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,180
If every adult

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,620
pays 120 qians of silver
for head tax every year,

79
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,740
our income will increase a lot every year.

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,020
If they do not have silver,

81
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,780
they also can pay the tax with grain.

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,660
In that case,

83
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,300
our grain will also increase a lot.

84
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,540
They are necessary for unexpected needs.

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,500
Well.

86
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,860
Is there anyone

87
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,900
who can calculate it for me?

88
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,540
Minister Liu, what do you say?

89
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,420
105,000 people.

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,980
Everyone pays 120 qians
of silver every year.

91
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,020
1,000 qians is equal to one tael.

92
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,940
It can be exchanged for 200 dous of rice.

93
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,220
It means...

94
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,940
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,300
It means an increase
of 100,000 taels of silver

96
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,460
or millions of dous of rice.

97
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,140
I never thought that
the Third Princess was so brilliant.

98
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,260
If such amount of income
is increased every year,

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
the difficulties Huayuan City is facing now

100
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,060
will be overcome.

101
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,460
Brilliant. Brilliant.

102
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,740
Her Highness is a governing talent.

103
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,300
It is a blessing for Huayuan City.

104
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,500
Wait.

105
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,260
Your Highness. Something seems to be wrong.

106
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,060
Does Minister Liu have a question?

107
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,020
Huayuan City has a total
population of 150,000,

108
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,740
in which 105,000 are adults.

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,900
Your Highness.

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,820
Have you included men in the calculation?

111
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,500
Of course.

112
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,100
Men and women

113
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,300
are all adults.

114
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,780
They all should pay the tax.

115
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,980
It seems that the Third Princess's
knowledge of political affairs

116
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,300
is not as good as the Second Princess.

117
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
In Huayuan City,

118
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,100
people who pay tax should
enjoy relevant rights.

119
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,220
If women pay tax, their social status
will be higher than that of men.

120
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,220
If men also pay tax,

121
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,940
doesn't it mean that we have
admitted the rights of men?

122
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
By that time,

123
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,540
men will be officials and businessmen.

124
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,580
They will have the same
social status with women.

125
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,780
The Third Princess is trying
to set a trap for Her Majesty.

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,260
If men pay tax, they will
become heads of households.

127
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,660
That is unacceptable.

128
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,900
If men have rights,

129
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,580
what will become of Huayuan City?

130
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,940
Its foundation will be damaged.

131
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,260
If that is so,

132
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,460
we may as well change the name
of Huayuan City into Xuanhu City.

133
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,900
Did the Third Princess have her brain damaged

134
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,460
in the Kung Fu test?

135
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,940
It is not easy to win,

136
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,540
but it is easy to loss.

137
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,500
Qianqian.

138
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,500
You are a princess of Huayuan City,

139
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,860
but you disregard the dignity
of our ancestors.

140
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,780
It is disgraceful.

141
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,380
Mother.

142
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,780
I am too naive.

143
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,380
Please still consider me to be a baby.

144
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,220
Sorry for my childish words.

145
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,020
It is OK.

146
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,660
Since Qianqian is still a baby,

147
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,860
let's not talk about it anymore.

148
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,900
Baby?

149
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,580
Next.

150
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
I have a piece of advice.

151
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,620
Xuanhu City makes black stones into bombs,

152
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,340
while Huayuan City makes
black stones into fireworks.

153
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,460
Your Highness. Look.

154
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,100
These are clothes and jewelry.

155
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,780
They are at a standard equal to those
for the Crown Princess.

156
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,260
Later, when I give these presents to Chuchu,

157
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,740
she will be very happy.

158
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
Congratulations! Chuchu.

159
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,980
Now you are the winner
of the discourse on politics.

160
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,060
Congratulations to you.
You are the winner of the Kung Fu test.

161
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,340
You know that I won the Kung Fu test

162
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,340
with some tactics.

163
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,260
When the results
of the literacy test come out,

164
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
you will be

165
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,820
the Crown Princess.

166
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,780
Look.

167
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,060
I have prepared presents for you.

168
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,780
We only need to wait
for mother's order of coronation.

169
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Presents?

170
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,460
For me?

171
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,180
Chuchu, think about my bet.

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,100
I will become rich because of you.

173
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,180
How is your wound?

174
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,980
I have been preparing
for the discourse test these days.

175
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,340
I didn't have time to see you.

176
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,460
It doesn't matter. It is a small wound.

177
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,300
It has been cured by the medicine
given by Yuanyuan.

178
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,660
(Auspiciousness lights up the virtuous household)

179
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,460
Following the god's will,

180
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,780
we hereby announce the results
of the Crown Princess Election.

181
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,180
The winner of the first place
in the discourse on politics

182
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,060
is the Second Princess Chen Chuchu.

183
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,700
The winner of the first place
in the Kung Fu test

184
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,060
The winner of the first place
in the Kung Fu test

185
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,540
is the Third Princess Chen Qianqian.

186
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,020
Without me,

187
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,100
Chen Qianqian couldn't win.

188
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,940
The winner of the first place
in the literacy test

189
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,820
The winner...

190
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,180
Your Majesty. This...

191
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,220
The winner of the first place
in the literacy test

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,420
is the Third Princess Chen Qianqian.

193
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
It is her.

194
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,620
How could she win the first place?

195
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,380
This

196
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,900
is ridiculous.

197
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,020
How strange!

198
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,380
The literacy test...I am the winner?

199
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,340
Congratulations to Your Highness.

200
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,740
Am I the winner?

201
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,500
The Third Princess Chen Qianqian

202
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,380
has brilliant literary ability

203
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,940
and excellent Kung Fu skills.

204
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,220
She is also a governing talent.

205
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,860
She is capable of shouldering
great responsibilities.

206
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,100
Therefore, she is conferred
the title of Crown Princess,

207
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,940
in order to make the city more prosperous
and protect Huayuan City.

208
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
Mother.

209
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,500
I am not suitable.

210
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,980
I can't be the Crown Princess.

211
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
Qianqian.

212
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,500
You have been intelligent
and diligent since childhood.

213
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,300
I always have great expectations for you.

214
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,940
You have won the election,

215
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
you should be the Crown Princess.

216
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,220
Why do you refuse?

217
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,860
I have neither talent nor virtue.

218
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,620
Chuchu...

219
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,980
Chuchu is more suitable to be the Crown Princess.

220
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,980
Please let Chuchu be the Crown Princess.

221
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,180
I am not good enough.

222
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
Chuchu. Do you agree?

223
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,220
Qianqian has been intelligent
since childhood.

224
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,940
I am willing to assist her.

225
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,180
I will be faithful to her.

226
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,500
No. No.

227
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,620
It is settled.

228
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,740
Qianqian. Go back home
and prepare for the coronation.

229
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,140
I am tired after a few busy days.

230
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,620
Mother. No.

231
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,540
Mother.

232
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,260
Dismiss.

233
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,340
Mother! No! Mother!

234
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,060
Mother. Chuchu. Chuchu.

235
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Chuchu. Chuchu.

236
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,060
Please don't go. Please don't go.

237
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,700
Your highness.

238
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,260
Please don't go.

239
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,420
All is ready.

240
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,180
What are Your Highness trying to explain?

241
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,620
You have prepared everything for yourself.

242
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,500
Don't pretend to be kind.

243
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,300
Chuchu.

244
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,460
Congratulations to you.

245
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,900
Now you are the Crown Princess.

246
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,620
Chuchu.

247
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,700
The Third Princess.

248
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,220
No, I mean Crown Princess.

249
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,820
Now you have won the whole Huayuan City.

250
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,540
Why are you still not happy?

251
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,540
It seems that I have won the whole city,

252
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,620
but actually I have lost the whole world.

253
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,580
Completely.

254
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,860
I have lost all my fortune.

255
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,940
No.

256
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,220
Why did I win?

257
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,100
You said I would lose
if I stuck to what I like.

258
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,780
What should I do?

259
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,380
Why are you dressed like this?

260
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,820
Right. You also bet that Chuchu would win.

261
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,380
Didn't you also bet on the Second Princess?

262
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,540
You...

263
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,100
Dismiss.

264
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,300
You are useless.

265
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,940
Nothing has been done and money is gone.

266
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,700
And I have to tell stories to you every day.

267
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,500
You. You...

268
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,300
You are the so-called braggers.

269
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,900
You do nothing except

270
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,100
bragging.

271
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,020
Your Highness. Please don't discard us.

272
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,020
Yes.

273
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,340
We still don't understand the relationship

274
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,380
among banana, orange and apple.

275
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,620
If we don't listen to your stories for one day,

276
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,140
we will feel agitated.

277
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,020
I will stop the project
of banana, orange and apple.

278
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,140
I can't afford you anymore.

279
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,660
The relations of characters are a mess.
I am done with it.

280
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,060
Minister Pei.

281
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,220
Do you want to see how miserable I am?

282
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,540
I know that you are a proud lady.

283
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,060
It is not strange

284
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
that you feel upset about your defeat.

285
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,980
I am here to comfort you.

286
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,380
Yes.

287
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,860
I have worked hard since I was a child.

288
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,660
But my mother's most favorite daughter

289
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,140
is always Qianqian.

290
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,420
She blatantly played tricks
in the Kung Fu test,

291
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,700
but mother judged that she won.

292
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,260
She acted wildly
and talked nonsense in the hall,

293
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
but mother was reluctant to punish her.

294
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,780
No matter how hard I work,

295
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,460
I won't be appreciated by mother.

296
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,820
Even though Qianqian is mischievous,

297
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,300
she is adored by my mother.

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,220
I am also a daughter of my mother.

299
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,420
Why does she treat us differently?

300
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,900
She who loves well chastises well.

301
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,980
Maybe Her Majesty

302
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,340
has higher expectations for you.

303
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,140
That's why she is stricter with you.

304
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,740
Higher expectations?

305
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,780
In the past, I would believe these words.

306
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,300
But now,

307
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,820
mother has conferred her
the title of Crown Princess.

308
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,820
I am not well today.

309
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,980
Sorry for the snub.

310
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
Please take care.

311
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,700
Crown Princess said

312
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,180
that she bet all her money on you.

313
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,220
But do you know

314
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,860
that Young Master Han bet all his money

315
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,140
on the Crown Princess.

316
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,740
He has earned a lot of money.

317
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,260
They were just playing tricks.

318
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,580
Your Highness have been deceived.

319
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,460
Are you sure?

320
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,260
Money have been sent to Yueli Mansion.

321
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

322
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,780
It is my fault.

323
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
I underestimated Chen Qianqian.

324
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,100
I won't believe a word
of what she says in future.

325
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Why did you ask me to come here?

326
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,500
Young Master bet a lot of money

327
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,940
that Your Highness would win
the title of Crown Princess.

328
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,060
He wanted to give you a surprise.

329
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,660
He never expected that

330
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,420
the odds were so high.

331
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,140
Let me put it this way:

332
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,460
now our mansion

333
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,140
is the biggest winner
in the whole Huayuan City.

334
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,660
What do you mean?

335
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,620
Is my money back?

336
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
Actually,

337
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
we should say that your money

338
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,260
was spent by you

339
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,740
and then earned back by me.

340
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,500
During the process,

341
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,660
I also earned some interest.

342
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,740
So it's you that helped me
win the literacy test.

343
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,620
Please don't thank me.

344
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,700
I said that

345
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,380
I will give you what you want.

346
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,380
You...

347
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,060
I...

348
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,980
You...

349
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,700
You are coquettish.

350
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,940
What does that mean?

351
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,740
You are truly the Crown Prince of Xuanhu City.

352
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
You're so dense.

353
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,740
What does "dense" mean?

354
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,980
It means handsome.

355
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,340
But I think you are mad at me.

356
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,180
Do you know that
you are a danger to your wife?

357
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,780
I...

358
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,140
I never said that I wanted
to be the Crown Princess.

359
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,980
But...

360
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,900
I have heard for a long time
that the Third Princess is capricious.

361
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,940
Now I know it is true.

362
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,180
I helped you to win
the title of Crown Princess.

363
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,340
I don't know what's wrong with it.

364
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,300
Before you give me anything,

365
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,780
can you ask me if I like it?

366
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,420
How could you not like

367
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,300
what I sent you?

368
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,020
Your Highness.

369
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,420
Auspicious clothes
for the parade have arrived.

370
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,780
I don't want to be the Crown Princess,

371
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,180
but this dress is so beautiful.

372
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,980
(Many talents compete in splendor)

373
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,020
Your Highness. This ceremonial dress

374
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,300
is made of fine silk fabrics.

375
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,060
It is very expensive.

376
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,900
You will ride a horse on the street,

377
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,740
offer sacrifices to heaven at the ancestral
temple, and meet Her Majesty.

378
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,860
You will be the most magnificent

379
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,900
Crown Princess of Huayuan City ever.

380
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,300
Why do I have to parade,
offer sacrifices and bow again?

381
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,580
They were all exempted when I got married.

382
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,100
Can't we get away with them this time?

383
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,420
Why did he come?

384
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,540
He is your husband, isn't he?

385
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,580
According to the ancestral rules,

386
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
you should attend
the coronation ceremony together.

387
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,340
You...

388
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,780
You see. Her Highness

389
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,740
is ungrateful.

390
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,060
Young Master actually did it
for the good of her.

391
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,700
Her Highness didn't need his help.

392
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,620
Let me tell you.

393
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,540
A right present is a surprise.

394
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,100
A wrong present is a scare.

395
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,860
Do you know what love is?

396
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,820
You sound like you understand it.

397
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,260
Of course I understand.

398
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,580
Whatever I do,

399
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,620
I do it for the good of Her Highness.

400
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,300
Yes, it is true.

401
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,540
But you are a little stupid.

402
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,820
You made 500 bamboo tubes,

403
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,380
as if you were afraid that
others could not find out.

404
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,220
You

405
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,620
just like talking about others' weakness.

406
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,140
Don't think that I don't know it.

407
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,980
On the day of bridegroom snatching,
you wanted to trap the Second Princess,

408
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,460
but in the end you trapped Her Highness.

409
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,620
You are unable to accomplish anything.

410
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,340
You are liable to spoil everything.

411
00:17:59,420 --> 00:17:59,980
You are unable to accomplish anything.

412
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,460
You are liable to spoil everything.

413
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,060
You are unable to accomplish anything.

414
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,900
You are liable to spoil everything.

415
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,780
the Third Princess is coming.

416
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,540
Since you didn't like it,

417
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,700
why didn't you tell me earlier?

418
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,980
I just never expected that
you would come up with such a big plan.

419
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,940
You even interfered in the succession affair.

420
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,260
Since ancient times, as long as
power struggle has been involved,

421
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,700
it has always meant life and death.

422
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,900
Do you know that someone behind you

423
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,580
may set you up?

424
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,020
If you don't fight,

425
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,700
you will get a blow
and face numerous disasters.

426
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,300
Let's not talk about anything else.

427
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,700
Isn't my disaster sitting beside me?

428
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,540
We are a couple.

429
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,140
How could I harm you?

430
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,940
Are we a couple?

431
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,140
Have we worshiped Heaven?

432
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,740
Have we slept together?

433
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,260
Have we bowed to Heaven and Earth?

434
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,860
Have we paraded?

435
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,420
Aren't we parading now?

436
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,980
Later, we will worship Heaven.

437
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
If you are not satisfied,

438
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,500
We can bow to Heaven and Earth later.

439
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,340
If that is not enough, we can

440
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,780
sleep together.

441
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,220
In your dreams.

442
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,420
Stop the cart.

443
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Why did the cart stop?

444
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,140
Your Highness.

445
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,060
You...

446
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,300
Do you think that we are not a couple

447
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,340
because we haven't completed
the marriage ceremony?

448
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,500
Without bowing to Heaven and Earth,
worshiping Heaven, and parading.

449
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,260
You are also trying to ruin this parade.

450
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,900
Excuse me. It is you who stopped the cart.

451
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,500
If Your Highness doesn't
want to parade with me,

452
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,980
I shall leave.

453
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,420
Han Shuo. Sorry. That is not what I meant.

454
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,140
I...

455
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,100
Han Shuo. Stop.

456
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,380
Han Shuo. I think you misunderstood me.

457
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,900
I really don't want to be the Crown Princess.

458
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,460
On the day when you were poisoned,

459
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
you said

460
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,940
you were crying all day

461
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,700
after losing the qualification
for attending Crown Princess Election.

462
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Now you said you didn't want
to be the Crown Princess.

463
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,020
I really don't know

464
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,980
what's on your mind.

465
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,540
Fortunately, I have recovered
from the heart disease.

466
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
Otherwise,

467
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,580
I would die today.

468
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,420
Yes.

469
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,540
I have cured your heart disease.

470
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,300
I cured you with Dragon Bone.

471
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,140
You took Dragon Bone just because you felt guilty.

472
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,620
You falsely accused me of communicating
with the spy of Xuanhu City.

473
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,140
I was almost killed by the Second Princess.

474
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,780
That was because I was afraid of you.

475
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,740
In the past, you looked like
a tiger eyeing its prey.

476
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,620
When I was in Yueli Mansion,

477
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,580
I haven't had a good meal.

478
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,540
When I faced a table of glazed plates,

479
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,300
I felt like I was drawing lots.

480
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,380
Your Highness was so cautious.

481
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,300
Do you have any secret?

482
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,100
The thing happened in
the Music and Dance Academy

483
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,380
was a humiliation to me.
I was embarrassed in public.

484
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,940
Why do you only hold grudges?

485
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,620
Do you forget what I did good for you?

486
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,940
Do you remember I lied that I was pregnant

487
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,740
and saved you from the death row.

488
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,260
The way I treated you...

489
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,020
Why was I in prison?

490
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,780
Wasn't it you who set me up?

491
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,500
In the past,

492
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,700
we weren't getting along
well with each other,

493
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,740
were we?

494
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,260
I thought that you were going to poison me.

495
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,740
You forced me to be your husband
on the street.

496
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,700
On the street.

497
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,340
On this very street.

498
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:12,940
Yes.

499
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,700
You forced me to marry you.

500
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,780
Otherwise, I would not poison you
in the bridal chamber.

501
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,540
You are shameless to say that.

502
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,180
I...

503
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,180
Why did I force you to marry me?

504
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,860
Because you seduced me.

505
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,860
Besides, I know that

506
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,180
the person you wanted to save
was not me, but Chuchu.

507
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,420
Young Master. It is our fault in this case.

508
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,420
How did she know?

509
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,780
I don't know.

510
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,220
I am the Young Master of Xuanhu.

511
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,460
How can I quarrel with a woman in the street?

512
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,540
Woman?

513
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,340
What's wrong with woman?

514
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,420
Please don't talk to me
in that discriminatory language.

515
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,700
Let me tell you.

516
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,300
In this world, only men and villains

517
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,180
are hard to get along with.

518
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Since you don't want me
to parade with you,

519
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,820
Please parade by yourself.

520
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,580
Fine.

521
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,660
Dress. Dress.

522
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,980
Wha...

523
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,900
What is going on?

524
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,060
This is ridiculous.

525
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,780
Han Shuo is tearing Qianqian's dress

526
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,660
in public

527
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,180
to humiliate his wife.

528
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,340
The men of Xuanhu City really
don't respect their wives.

529
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,100
They don't know how to sever women
and are unfaithful.

530
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,700
He is not good enough for Qianqian.

531
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,100
What are you looking at?

532
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,820
Han Shuo. Han Shuo. Don't go.

533
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,540
Han Shuo. I hate you.

534
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,900
It seems that the Crown Princess
doesn't like Young Master Han.

535
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,820
Qianqian spends time in
the Music and Dance Academy every evening.

536
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,180
When it comes to love affairs,

537
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,820
she only fancies something new.

538
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,100
Han Shuo is so pathetic.

539
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,780
He loves her so much.

540
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,380
As far as I am concerned,

541
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Your Highness is a natural fit
with Young Master Han.

542
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,500
Though the Crown Princess kidnapped the bridegroom,

543
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,340
she will return him back eventually.

544
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,340
I was stripped off clothes in the parade.

545
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,780
What should it be called?

546
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,980
The Emperor's New Clothes.

547
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,940
It is disgraceful.

548
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,260
Your Highness. Please don't angry.

549
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,980
Would you like to have an orange?

550
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,140
Peel the orange?

551
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
That's bad luck. Peel a banana.

552
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,020
Yes.

553
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Young Master.

554
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,420
Luckily you walked on the street.

555
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,300
If I gave you a horse,

556
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,300
wouldn't you have dragged me

557
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,780
all the way down the street?

558
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,820
I don't want to see the bana...

559
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
you anymore.

560
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,180
Your Highness.

561
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,060
What is this?

562
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,740
Now you are the Crown Princess.

563
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,780
You need to help Her Majesty
to handle the government affairs.

564
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,860
Doesn't the Crown Princess
have an internship period?

565
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,540
If I have to handle
so much work in the beginning,

566
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,660
I will be stressed out.

567
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,340
When the Crown Princess paraded on the street,
she took off her clothes. She disregarded...

568
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Is this an official document?

569
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,380
This is a tabloid.

570
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,100
All are nonsense.

571
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,260
If you feel angry, please don't read it.

572
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,220
No.

573
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,980
Young Master. Listen carefully.

574
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,820
When the Crown Princess paraded on the street,
she took off her clothes.

575
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,020
She disregarded ancestral etiquette.

576
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,780
What she did is disgraceful

577
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,940
and disgusting.

578
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,340
She even frolicked with
Young Master on the street.

579
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,340
They chased one another,

580
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,100
blatantly flirting on the street.

581
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,140
Their conducts made people annoyed.

582
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,460
Her Highness read it so aloud

583
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,140
as if it had nothing to do with her.

584
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,860
Keep your big mouth shut!

585
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,420
Shut up.

586
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,780
I don't want to see you again.

587
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,860
Bandits on the Weimeng Mountain
often harass traveling merchants.

588
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,380
the Crown Princess should lead
the City Guards to suppress bandits.

589
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,820
What is this about?

590
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,620
If you want, you can go there. I won't do it.

591
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,220
This is my room.

592
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,820
You should leave.

593
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,260
This is the soup that I sent to the Crown Princess.

594
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,260
Why has it been sent back?

595
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,260
Her Highness said that

596
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,980
your soup tastes awful.

597
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,580
She wanted you to drink it yourself.

598
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,980
Young Master. Don't be angry.

599
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,540
Am I angry?

600
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,100
It is she who is angry with me.

601
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,260
I don't dare to be angry with her.

602
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,380
Bai Ji.

603
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,100
Do you think that I am angry?

604
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,060
Young Master.

605
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,580
You have read a lot of books
on the art of war since childhood.

606
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,100
You know a lot of strategies.

607
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,860
Is there any strategy that

608
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,060
you can use to tackle Her Highness?

609
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,700
This is not about war.

610
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,140
Young Master.

611
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,380
I have heard that

612
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,140
if a couple has disputes,

613
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,820
one side should not talk first
to the other side.

614
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,860
The one who talks first is the loser.

615
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,300
I have a strategy.

616
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,660
You should ignore her.

617
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,300
Are you a spy sent by Pei Heng?

618
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,020
You misunderstood me.

619
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,300
In the past, if someone offended you,

620
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
you would do the same thing

621
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,060
to that person.

622
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,900
You have always been determined.

623
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,500
But when it comes to Her Highness,

624
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,860
you look indecisive.

625
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,420
Pay somebody back

626
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,700
in his own coin.

627
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,020
I have an idea. Bai Ji.

628
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,740
Listen to me.

629
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
Will it work?

630
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,380
Let us have a try.

631
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,340
Hurry up.

632
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,060
Yes.

633
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,660
I shouldn't tear your dress

634
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,140
during the parade.

635
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,260
Now, you can tear my dress.

636
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,220
When you walk, my dress will be stripped off.

637
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,020
You...

638
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,220
I will do what you said.

639
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,380
You are boring.

640
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,780
Your Highness. Minister Pei is coming.

641
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,500
Chen Qianqian. Stop.

642
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,620
Qianqian. What are you doing?

643
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,340
Pei Heng.

644
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,220
I was playing a game with my wife.

645
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,620
Please don't laugh at me.

646
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Young Master Han is really

647
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,820
different from the men of Huayuan City.

648
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,100
Since you are in Huayuan City now,

649
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,820
you should get rid of

650
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,220
the bad habits of the men of Huayuan City.

651
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,060
I...

652
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,660
(Men Virtues)
Young Master Han

653
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,940
should read this book carefully.

654
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,060
Yes. Read it carefully.

655
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,940
(Men Virtues)

656
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
Ok. I will read it.

657
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,460
Pei Heng.

658
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,140
You've come just at the right moment.

659
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,180
I have received a lot of official documents

660
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,540
and I don't know how to handle them.

661
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,660
If you have time,

662
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,620
can you come here to help me
to handle government affairs?

663
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,540
In Huayuan City, women are rulers.

664
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,900
It is not suitable for men
to interfere in government affairs.

665
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,700
It doesn't matter.

666
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
You're not an outsider.

667
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,700
Come on.

668
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,940
Handling official documents is not difficult.

669
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,460
Young Master has been doing it
since childhood.

670
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
Has Pei Heng left?

671
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,020
No.

672
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,900
There are just two of them in the room.

673
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,820
What do they have to talk about?

674
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,820
Recently, Criminal Minister judged

675
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,500
a case of domestic violence crime
committed by a blacksmith.

676
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,300
Tie family.

677
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,020
A blacksmith from Jiang family.

678
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,260
The housewife often beat
her husband violently.

679
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,780
The husband sued for divorce
many times but failed.

680
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,660
He eventually couldn't stand it anymore
and beat his wife violently.

681
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,100
His wife was shocked.

682
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,340
She couldn't accept the reality
of being beaten.

683
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,780
According to the law of Huayuan City,

684
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,460
it is judged

685
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,460
that the husband shall
be torn apart by five horses.

686
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,620
What is that?

687
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,940
Men and women are so unequal.

688
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,020
Why are men so vulnerable

689
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,700
in marriage?

690
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,700
In Huayuan City,

691
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,420
according to ancestral precepts,

692
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,980
men should be obedient
and obey virtue ethics.

693
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,460
If a man beats his wife,

694
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,020
he commits a severe crime.

695
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,180
But that was too much.

696
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,380
Men and women should respect each other

697
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,260
in marriage life.

698
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,660
Apart from that, men should have

699
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,540
the same social status as you.

700
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,820
They shouldn't be treated differently
because of gender.

701
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,260
As for me,

702
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,140
I am just an exceptional case.

703
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
My status depends on the fame of my mother

704
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,060
the late Minister Pei,

705
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,700
the affection from Her Majesty,

706
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,540
and the marriage contract with you.

707
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,220
No. No.

708
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,580
Don't think in that way.

709
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,540
It is because of your talent

710
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,540
that you became the first
male minister in Huayuan City.

711
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,780
In my mind,

712
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,460
you are a true man.

713
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,580
You have talent but don't show off.

714
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,660
You treat people with gentleness
and deal things with good sense.

715
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,100
Besides, you are handsome.

716
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,500
I must say that you are a male god.

717
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Male god?

718
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,340
Male god?

719
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,620
How should I explain it?

720
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,260
It is like...

721
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,020
When people meet you

722
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,260
and see you,

723
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,740
they will like you unconsciously.

724
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,220
What's wrong? Why are you shy?

725
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,380
Thank Your Highness for your affection.

726
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,660
No. No. Pei Heng.

727
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,660
You misunderstood me.

728
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,500
I didn't mean that.

729
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,540
The like I just said

730
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,700
is not the like

731
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,580
that you think.

732
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,540
The like that you think...

733
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,420
Qianqian.

734
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,020
You don't have to explain.

735
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,220
I know.

736
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,660
You don't know.

737
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,420
Young Master. What's wrong with you?

738
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,940
Does your heart disease recur?

739
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,700
I feel a little uncomfortable.

740
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,060
It's OK.

741
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,980
I just asked Her Highness.

742
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,980
I was told that there are
a lot of government affairs.

743
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,860
They have been working till now.

744
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,420
the Crown Princess is afraid
that it is too late for Minister Pei

745
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,300
to go home,

746
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,220
so she asked servants

747
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,620
to arrange accommodation for him.

748
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,580
It turns out that I was busy for nothing.

749
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,580
I helped her to be the Crown Princess.

750
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,660
She never thanked me for that.

751
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,620
Besides, Pei Heng also found
an excuse to approach Qianqian.

752
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,420
Young Master.

753
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,020
Isn't it like bringing a wolf into the house?

754
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,780
Don't blame me for using some strategies.

755
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,220
Suppressing bandits in Weimeng Mountain

756
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,580
(City Owner's Mansion)
should be under Crown Princess's charge.

757
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,140
the Crown Princess just took office.

758
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,060
It is time for her to make some achievements.

759
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,300
But Her highness has lost all her Kung Fu.

760
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,380
I am afraid that it's dangerous
for her to lead the army.

761
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,580
I think

762
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,380
we had better send the Second Princess
to Weimeng Mountain.

763
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,420
In that case, the Crown Princess can go
with Young Master Han.

764
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,220
Young Master Han
is highly skilled in Kung Fu.

765
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,980
He is capable enough to protect Her Highness.

766
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,740
Then, they will quarrel all the way

767
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,860
to Weimeng Mountain.

768
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,180
Do you think the parade case

769
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,380
is not disgraceful enough?

770
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,300
It is not strange that
a couple would quarrel.

771
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,700
Maybe by this chance

772
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,140
they will experience some things together.

773
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,260
Their relationship will
become more harmonious.

774
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,980
Your Majesty. What do you think?

775
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,140
Qianqian should really gain some experience.

776
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,580
Sangqi.

777
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,220
Order the Crown Princess

778
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,220
to suppress bandits in Weimeng Mountain.

779
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,740
Young Master Han shall go with her.

780
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,540
Yes.

781
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,940
You're wise, Your Majesty.

782
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
Do I have to go there?

783
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,460
We will appreciate Your Highness' hard work.

784
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,820
Please go to Weimeng Mountain
with Young Master.

785
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,780
Your Highness. What are you doing?

786
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
I won't go there.

787
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,020
Why?

788
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,780
I will go with you.

789
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,620
You don't have to worry about anything.

790
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,220
Think of it as a trip
to the mountains and rivers.

791
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,340
I have no experience in war.

792
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,300
Besides, if anything goes wrong,

793
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
civilians at the foot of
Weimeng Mountain will suffer.

794
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,060
Such an important mission
should be carried out by Chuchu.

795
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,860
She should lead the army to suppress bandits.

796
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,300
Then she would win a great fame.

797
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,020
It seems that Her Highness

798
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,220
just wants to handle official documents
with Minister Pei.

799
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,340
Don't talk nonsense, even though it is true.

800
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,580
It seems that Your Highness
only cares about Minister Pei.

801
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,420
Weimeng Mountain is far away.

802
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,260
Aren't you afraid that
I will meet some lady on the road

803
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
and will not come back?

804
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,980
Do you think you are capable of that?

805
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,700
I, Chen Xiaoqian,

806
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,700
got stuck in my screenplay.

807
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,620
I only have two missions.

808
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,020
First, survive.

809
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
Second, bring Han Shuo and Chuchu together

810
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,780
to wrap up the story.

811
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,500
I think I would not die soon.

812
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,300
There is only one thing left.

813
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,820
I can accept the mission to suppress bandits,

814
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,500
but I need to bring a person with me.

815
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,500
No.

816
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,420
Chuchu.

817
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,340
By the order of Her Majesty,

818
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,340
all the people in the city
shall follow the order of Your Highness.

819
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,260
Zi Rui. Ask Chuchu to go with us.

820
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,260
Yes.

821
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,380
Good evening, Young Master.

822
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,740
You summoned me at late night.
What is the matter that is so urgent?

823
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,900
the Crown Princess will go to Weimeng Mountain
to suppress bandits.

824
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,020
Han Shuo will go with Her Highness.

825
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,780
Do you think

826
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,500
he can take care of Qianqian?

827
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,780
Do you mean

828
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,380
that I should go with them?

829
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,140
You grew up in Pei's Mansion

830
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
and have been an attendant
of me for many years.

831
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,580
You manage affairs of the mansion

832
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,460
in an orderly way.

833
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,340
You are most thoughtful and considerate.

834
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,220
So I only trust you.

835
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,940
Please don't worry, Young Master.

836
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,180
I will stay with Her Highness

837
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,460
and take good care of her.

838
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,900
Wine pots, tea cups, wine...

839
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,340
Zi Rui.

840
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,380
Zi Rui.

841
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,620
Where are my wine pots, tea cups,

842
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,740
and the two-flavored hot pot,

843
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,300
and hot pot seasoning?

844
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,460
I have brought them.

845
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,060
Really?

846
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,700
You see.

847
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,780
All is put inside.

848
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,140
Cover it.

849
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,100
OK. One more thing.

850
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,420
Twenty sets of underclothes,

851
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,500
twenty sets of garments,

852
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,580
three mantles,

853
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,020
and my favorite

854
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,660
jewelry and food.

855
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,740
All should be brought with us.

856
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,860
All is ready. You see.

857
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
The boxes are all full.

858
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,140
They are full.

859
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,380
We are supposed to suppress bandits.

860
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,820
We are not moving house.

861
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,580
You nearly have emptied Yueli Mansion.

862
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,260
We should be prepared in case of need.

863
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,460
I am here.

864
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,940
You don't need to worry.

865
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,780
It is you who don't need to worry.

866
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,860
During this bandit suppression,

867
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,220
I will arrange everything

868
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,140
for Chuchu and you.

869
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,780
What are you laughing at?

870
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,220
You seem very happy to
fight bandits with me.

871
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,620
Of course.

872
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,860
I will fight bandits with
Young Master and Chuchu.

873
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,220
We are sure to win and return home.

874
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,620
Don't worry.

875
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,180
I won't let you waste a trip.

876
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,620
Your Highness.

877
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,980
Knowing that you'll go to Weimeng Mountain
to suppress bandits,

878
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,900
Minister Pei came to see you off.

879
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,900
He arrived with an attendant

880
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,060
and said that he would send him to you.

881
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,500
OK.

882
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,540
No.

883
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,500
He has already arrived.

884
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,700
Shouldn't we see him?

885
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,700
Ask them to come in.

886
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,580
One, three, one, eight,

887
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,420
three, two...

888
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,340
Weimeng Mountain is far away.

889
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,020
This trip will take two to three months.

890
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,620
Please don't worry.

891
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,300
I will take care of myself.

892
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,900
I will accompany Qianqian along the way.

893
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,860
There is nothing for you to worry about.

894
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,780
Why do you want to send an attendant to us?

895
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,460
Please don't laugh at me.

896
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,180
This attendant

897
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,900
is delicate and considerate
with a good temper.

898
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,300
He serves people

899
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,140
better than men in Xuanhu City.

900
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,700
I believe you will also like him.

901
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
You are so generous.

902
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,940
Just an attendant.

903
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,300
I am willing to give up him.

904
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,220
You are willing to give up your attendant,

905
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,900
but I am not willing to give up my wife.

906
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,700
I will take care of Qianqian.

907
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,020
Strange! It feels like a domestic dispute.

908
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,420
Pei Heng, well...

909
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,020
I really appreciate your kindness,

910
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,620
but I will not accept the attendant.

911
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,580
Because I already have

912
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,060
Han Shuo, Zi Rui,

913
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,020
and Chuchu.

914
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,340
Every person has different thoughts.

915
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,700
It is not easy to lead such a team.

916
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,940
So...

917
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,140
My name is Su Ziying.

918
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,340
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

919
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,740
For the sake of our Young Master's

920
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,700
concern for you,

921
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,860
would you please accept me?

922
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,420
Please allow me to report to him
if we are safe and sound from time to time.

923
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,220
She will not accept you.

924
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,260
Minister Pei.

925
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,580
Before you send anything to others,

926
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,140
please ask them if they like it. Am I right?

927
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,060
Wait a moment.

928
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,020
What's your name again?

929
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,820
My name is Su Ziying.

930
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,380
Are you Yingying?

931
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,420
How do you know my infant name?

932
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,140
So he is

933
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,620
the new role I added

934
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,020
to push forward the plot.

935
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,620
In the end, he'll become the match maker
for Chuchu and Han Shuo.

936
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,740
I just need a talent like you.

937
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,180
Zi Rui.

938
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,140
What are you waiting for?

939
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,420
Hurry up and ask others
to pack all things up.

940
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,980
We will depart soon.

941
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,020
I was looking for you in wind and rain.

942
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,900
I never expected that you would appear today.

943
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,620
Let's go.

944
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,420
Go.

945
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,140
Yes.

946
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,300
Please take care of him.

947
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,340
Young Master.

948
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,700
You used a strategy

949
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,820
to separate Pei Heng from Her Highness,

950
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,980
so you can bring her with you
to suppress bandits.

951
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,180
I didn't expect him to take counter measures.

952
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,180
He just seized this opportunity

953
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,940
and sent a spy to watch us.

954
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,300
Why did Her Highness

955
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,620
fall into his trap?

956
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,660
It seems that I spoiled her too much.

957
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,340
She just accepted a man without asking me.

958
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,980
But he's just an attendant.

959
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,380
But he is still a man.
