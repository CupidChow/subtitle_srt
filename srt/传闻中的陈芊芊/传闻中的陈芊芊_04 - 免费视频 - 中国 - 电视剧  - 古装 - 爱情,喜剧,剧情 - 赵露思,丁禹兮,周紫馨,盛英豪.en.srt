(Episode 4)

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,900
She wasn't hitting you

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,340
but me.

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,580
Your Highness, don't mind it.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,860
It didn't hurt when she whipped me.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,140
But if

29
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,620
you're angered,

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,260
my heart

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,740
will ache.

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,740
Don't! Don't!

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,020
Please don't be like this!

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,300
I know you are reluctant to stay
at the Music and Dance Academy.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
And you are tired of putting on
a fake smile every day.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,500
From now on,

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,740
you don't have to play up to me.

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,380
Just see me as your friend.

39
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,340
I can't take your flirting anymore.

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,780
How could I dare do that?

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm just a musician

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,900
with low status.

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,380
I dare not

44
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,420
befriend Your Highness.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,980
But you didn't choose to be a musician.

46
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,220
If possible,

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,700
who wouldn't want to be

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,900
born in a noble family

49
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,540
and enjoy a wealthy life like Pei Heng?

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,340
After all, it's my fault.

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,340
Your Highness, please don't blame yourself.

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,100
The small wounds are no big deal.

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,140
But as for these rewards,

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,700
I

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,700
no longer dare receive.

56
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,980
Zi Rui,

57
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,700
if you go back,

58
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,820
Lin Qi may give you a hard time again.

59
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,060
But I belong to the Music and Dance Academy.

60
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,860
I've decided to give you the gifts,

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,340
how can I take them back?

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,420
No.

63
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,860
I have to talk to Lin Qi!

64
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,940
Your Highness!

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,100
The Crown Princess Election will take place soon.

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,860
It's better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

67
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,420
If Her Majesty blames you for...

68
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,620
I don't care about
the Crown Princess Election at all!

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,700
Your Highness!

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,380
Well...

71
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,580
Chen Qianqian will like that?

72
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,820
After all, you two were brought together
because of a horse.

73
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
Makes sense.

74
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,900
(Yueli Mansion)
Since she likes me,

75
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,500
she'll be happy

76
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,660
with whatever I give to her.

77
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,020
Young Master Han.

78
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,380
Is the Third Princess inside?

79
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,460
Young Master.

80
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
Su Mu was just here.

81
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,380
Then Her Highness and he rushed

82
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,660
to the Music and Dance Academy together.

83
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,980
The Music and Dance Academy?

84
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,220
Young Master.

85
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,380
You just said that she was in love with you.

86
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,860
Then why would she go to the Music
and Dance Academy?

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,780
When women misbehave,

88
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,780
you need to correct them.

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,100
Right! That's right!

90
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,740
You want to buy Su Mu?

91
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,020
Yes.

92
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,100
Tell me,

93
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,940
why?

94
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,620
For him,

95
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,420
you not only come to the Academy frequently,

96
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,300
but also wanna buy him
so that you can see him every day.

97
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,940
You already have

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,020
Han Shuo in your mansion, don't you?

99
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,820
He's not good enough?

100
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,780
I want to buy Su Mu,

101
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,140
not because I want him to entertain me,

102
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,820
but because he doesn't want
to stay at the Academy.

103
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,660
I redeem him so that he can
get his freedom back.

104
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
As for Han Shuo,

105
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,020
would you stop working against him

106
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,740
because of me?

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,340
He's not a pushover as you think.

108
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,060
He's good at Kung Fu and tactical skills.

109
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,620
He's just suffering from
heart disease right now.

110
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,940
Don't always look down upon him.

111
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,300
Who do you think

112
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,100
would want to be a musician here?

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,860
Don't pretend to be nice.

114
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,700
With Su Mu's reputation,

115
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,780
where else can he go?

116
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,060
Without you by his side,

117
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
anybody can bully him.

118
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,100
Where can he go?

119
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,020
I've had a place for him.

120
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,700
Anyway,

121
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,300
it's none of your business.

122
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,980
Thanks!

123
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,500
Young Master.

124
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,980
Su Mu is just a musician.

125
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,140
Why is the Third Princess willing
to offend the Lins for him?

126
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,340
This rumored the Third Princess

127
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,220
is getting more and more interesting.

128
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,420
More and more interesting?

129
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,060
What do you mean?

130
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,300
She could apologize to me that night,

131
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,300
it shows she isn't as arrogant
and bossy as the rumor says.

132
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,740
In fact, she's quite cute.

133
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
And today, she was able to
come up with a line for the poem,

134
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
which means she's not
as illiterate as people think.

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,260
She is now trying to save Su Mu,

136
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,100
so she's not a heartless person as we heard.

137
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,020
She's actually nice and kind.

138
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,300
When you think about it, it's really true.

139
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,020
The Third Princess only asked for a musician.

140
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,580
Yet Lin Qi refused her.

141
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,180
Then I'll make all the musicians

142
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,900
around Lin Qi disappear.

143
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,580
So, should we kill the musicians

144
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,660
or set the Academy on fire?

145
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,700
Your Majesty.

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,060
the Third Princess is young

147
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,900
and in good health.

148
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,060
But I have heart problems,

149
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,500
and I won't live long.

150
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,020
I feel so sorry.

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,940
Your Majesty, I hope you can give an order

152
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,820
to send all musicians of the Academy

153
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,780
to the Third Princess's mansion

154
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,940
to play music and sing for her,

155
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,620
so that she won't be lonely.

156
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,260
Young Master Han,

157
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,380
you should talk to the Third Princess.

158
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
How can we send all musicians

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,340
to Yueli Mansion?

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,140
I know I don't have many days left.

161
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,980
I can't accompany Her Highness all the time.

162
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,780
As long as Her Highness is happy,

163
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,660
even if I die someday,

164
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,780
I won't have any regrets!

165
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,260
Since you've made your mind,

166
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,620
I'll grant your request.

167
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,980
From this day on,

168
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,940
the musicians of the Academy

169
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,660
will move to Yueli Mansion.

170
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
Thank you, Your Majesty!

171
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,060
Your Highness, about this matter...

172
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,820
Your Highness!

173
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
I thought you only had Su Mu in your heart.

174
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,260
But, I was brought here, too.

175
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,940
Stop!

176
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,780
I...

177
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,340
I...

178
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,860
Your Highness!

179
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,140
What's going on?

180
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,140
I heard it was an order from Her Majesty.

181
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,780
We'll belong to Yueli Mansion from now on.

182
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,300
Greetings to Your Highness!

183
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,980
Miss Lin Qi!

184
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,540
Miss Lin Qi, you are so generous!

185
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,780
You didn't want the money,

186
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,820
and now,

187
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,220
your business is banned!

188
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,700
You...

189
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,980
She'll hit me!

190
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,580
I... I hit you?

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,660
Miss Lin.

192
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,660
What?

193
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,100
Came to Yueli Mansion to make trouble?

194
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,340
She's Her Majesty's daughter.

195
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,380
I'm fine if she strong-arms me.

196
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,300
But who do you think you are?

197
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,780
How dare you to challenge me?

198
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
I remember

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,260
that you used to use whip, too.

200
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,740
Never mind!

201
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,940
That was ancient history already.

202
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,580
Having you is good enough for me now.

203
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,860
Catch!

204
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,060
Fine!

205
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
Yueli Mansion!

206
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,940
I'll remember what you did to me today!

207
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,060
Lin Qi!

208
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,020
You can take the other musicians back.

209
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,620
I only want Su Mu.

210
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Your Highness.

211
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,780
Young Master Han even

212
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,780
lowered himself for these musicians.

213
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,780
And now,

214
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,300
people all say that you two, as a couple,

215
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,740
one dares to ask,

216
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,580
and the other dares to take.

217
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,460
He sacrificed so much for you.

218
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,940
So, just keep

219
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,460
these musicians to yourself.

220
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,540
You asked my mother

221
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,700
to send these musicians here?

222
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,180
And you also

223
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,820
lowered yourself?

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,180
As a woman,

225
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,620
why did you ask that?

226
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,980
You didn't feel embarrassed to tell,

227
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,460
why would I feel embarrassed to hear?

228
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,260
I...

229
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,220
Your Highness!

230
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,260
Where should I accommodate so many people?

231
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,580
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

232
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,900
Young Master, greetings to you!

233
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,020
Rise.

234
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,260
Young Master is indeed clever!

235
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,940
You came up with this idea,

236
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,460
so that I could see you with no trouble.

237
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,020
But...

238
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,900
Sorry that I'm incompetent.

239
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,780
I've spied in Huayuan City for years,

240
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,940
but still haven't found the Dragon Bone.

241
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,620
However, my clients

242
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,060
are all high-ranking officials and noblemen.

243
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,220
About how much money in the treasury,

244
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,100
how many troops and provisions
the City Guards own,

245
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,620
even the health condition of the City Owner,

246
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,300
I know them all!

247
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,260
Young Master, what do you want to ask?

248
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,460
Just go ahead and ask me!

249
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
What did Chen Qianqian do

250
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,020
when she visited the Academy before?

251
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,940
Young Master!

252
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,060
I heard

253
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,980
that the Second Princess

254
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,740
took all the musicians away.

255
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
What?

256
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,180
I just heard that.

257
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,340
(If anything untoward should happen to me,
the Second Princess Chuchu would be the City Owner.)

258
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,540
Forget about the writing.

259
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,860
Chuchu has become

260
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,540
so lazy recently.

261
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,060
She hangs out with the people of
the Music and Dance Academy every day.

262
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,780
That'll only diminish her.

263
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,740
It's such a waste
that I've done so much for her.

264
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,220
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

265
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,020
I heard that the Third Princess
has been very well behaved.

266
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,460
Even the only musician in her mansion

267
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,500
will be sent away soon.

268
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,620
Is that so?

269
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,100
It appears
that she's doing it for Young Master Han.

270
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,780
Young Master,

271
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,940
why did you give all the musicians

272
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,420
to the Second Princess, except for Su Mu?

273
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,100
So that our spies

274
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,380
can continue to do their job.

275
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,980
Young Master is indeed clever!

276
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,980
I thought

277
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,980
you wanted to make
the Third Princess look good,

278
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,700
so you sent the musicians
to the Second Princess

279
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,300
to ruin her reputation.

280
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,140
But no matter what,

281
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
you got Su Mu for the Third Princess,

282
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,060
she must be thankful for you.

283
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,860
I heard

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,060
that she spent a lot of money
on a Guqin.

285
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,420
I think it's a gift for you.

286
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,740
She rarely does things particularly for me.

287
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,780
When she comes later to drop off the gift,

288
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,220
we need to act surprised

289
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,940
to make her feel good.

290
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,580
And don't tell her

291
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,620
that I don't play Qin.

292
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,860
You are so thoughtful, Young Master!

293
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,420
Young Master!

294
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,700
Your Highness!

295
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,860
Young Master is over here!

296
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,820
Morning!

297
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,340
And?

298
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,660
And?

299
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,540
I heard you cough.

300
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
Take good care and drink more warm water.

301
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,060
Do you think Pei Heng will like this Qin?

302
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
Of course not.

303
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,060
He hates playing the Qin.

304
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,700
Don't you remember

305
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,700
that when you were little,

306
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,620
in order to show the power
of the women in Huayuan,

307
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,020
he was asked to play the Qin on site

308
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,580
at the feast of every festival?

309
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,500
So, he...

310
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,500
So, it has

311
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,140
left a scar on his heart?

312
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,180
That's right.

313
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,580
No wonder he hates me so much.

314
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,980
Then I should really give him this Qin.

315
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,020
Bai Ji.

316
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,780
Whom did you say

317
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,700
this Qin was for?

318
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,060
Please give me another chance

319
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,060
to fix my mistake!

320
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,300
You...

321
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,980
You know

322
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,620
that I never liked Qin.

323
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,980
Really?

324
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,940
You can fool others,

325
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,180
but not me.

326
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,700
Playing the Qin can help you
express your feelings.

327
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,980
It's your favorite hobby.

328
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,620
The Qin I brought to you
was made by a great master.

329
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,060
The best Qin should be played
by the best player.

330
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
Listen to me.

331
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,020
You need to stick to what you like.

332
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,660
I'm happy if you are happy.

333
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,100
I know

334
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,500
people all think

335
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,140
that only musicians like
to play the Qin to please women.

336
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,420
You don't want people
to think of you that way,

337
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,700
so you'd rather not play.

338
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,020
And you pretend
that you don't like it at all,

339
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,620
because you don't want to be a pleasing tool.

340
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,140
A knowledgeable,

341
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,660
righteous, smart and talented

342
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,980
person like you,

343
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,500
shouldn't care too much

344
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,260
about what people think.

345
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,220
Actually,

346
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,860
Su Mu is just like you.

347
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,420
He doesn't want to stay at the Academy...

348
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,860
It's okay!

349
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,100
Just think about it.

350
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
No matter you'll keep Su Mu or not,

351
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,740
I hope you can stick to your heart

352
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,660
and do what you want to do.

353
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,500
How was it?

354
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,700
Has he made a decision?

355
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,420
Has Minister Pei said yes?

356
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,380
Your Highness.

357
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm already very thankful

358
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,660
for your thoughtfulness.

359
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,620
If you

360
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,180
can go to the Academy

361
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,020
to visit me every now and then in the future,

362
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,540
that'll be good enough for me.

363
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,900
Pei Heng will let you stay!

364
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Chen Qianqian!

365
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,380
Did you force him to play again?

366
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,100
Don't you feel ashamed?

367
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,500
Stay away from Minister Pei!

368
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,340
Qianqian!

369
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,580
I thought you went to meet your bosom friend.

370
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,980
What?

371
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,540
You hurt your arm from playing the Qin?

372
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,220
Can't believe you are mocking me
while I'm in pain.

373
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,420
Your arm is dislocated.

374
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,020
I need to reset your arm.

375
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,460
When I pop it in place, it'll hurt a little.

376
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,500
Hang in there.

377
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,780
Hurt?

378
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,180
Hurt?

379
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,460
Your Highness, don't you remember?

380
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,460
The Third Princess began to
practice Kung Fu from an early age.

381
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,900
She fell from a horse when she was seven,

382
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,300
fell from a roof when she was ten.

383
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,620
She even broke her legs more than once,

384
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,020
and she never complained.

385
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,060
So, there's no way that
this little arm problem will hurt her!

386
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,540
I remember.

387
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,580
Your Highness, don't worry!

388
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,220
Just go ahead

389
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,580
and reset her arm,

390
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,020
no matter how hurt it'll be.

391
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,220
Zi Rui, you know me so well!

392
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,180
Good for you!

393
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Of course!

394
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,340
Then I'll start now.

395
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,980
Hold on!

396
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,660
Will you please say something

397
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,260
to distract me?

398
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,620
Though I'm fat,

399
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm still afraid of pain!

400
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,140
What... What are you doing?

401
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,020
I've sent them out.

402
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,980
Are you sure you can do this?

403
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,220
I'm your husband. You don't trust me?

404
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,900
How's that relevant to this?

405
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,020
When we first met,

406
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,300
you were in red dress and looked so gorgeous.

407
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,380
Even though your horse was out of control
and you almost fell,

408
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,140
you stayed calm and came through.

409
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,660
Your bravery in crisis

410
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,060
made me fall in love with you right away.

411
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,940
I vowed that I'd marry nobody but you.

412
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,940
I know

413
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,940
that you love me deeply.

414
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,300
I feel the same to you.

415
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,020
Isn't that "Humph" a little too careless?

416
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,340
Who said I was careless?

417
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,500
Done!

418
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,860
It's done?

419
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,060
So,

420
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,460
you only said those things

421
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,860
to distract me.

422
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,020
That's why you talked nonsense.

423
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,780
Since you are so afraid of pain,

424
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,660
why have you been

425
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,460
pretending that you were not?

426
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,660
I am not!

427
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,500
It's not quite done yet.

428
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,460
I need to readjust a bit.

429
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,820
No! Stop it!

430
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,860
I am afraid.

431
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,700
I am.

432
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,700
I had to pretend
because of the tough situation.

433
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,100
I'm the Third Princess, after all.

434
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,900
Since Zi Rui believes that I'm not afraid,
I'll go with it.

435
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,140
You are so nosy!

436
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,580
You can all come in now!

437
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,580
Why did Lin Qi

438
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,020
strike a surprise attack on me?

439
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,260
Because she knew she couldn't defeat me!

440
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,340
We've had so many fights
since we were little.

441
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,820
I've never been defeated.

442
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,100
After I'm recovered,

443
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,740
I'll go teach her a lesson!

444
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,420
Yuanyuan,

445
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,540
how long will it take for me to recover?

446
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,980
Young Master did a good job.

447
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,420
With your health condition,

448
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,140
you are fine already.

449
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,260
Already!

450
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,140
Al...

451
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,780
Your Highness,

452
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,500
I'll go invite Miss Lin Qi right now.

453
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
Wait!

454
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,060
Forget it!

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm the daughter of Her Majesty.

456
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,220
I'll be a bigger person.

457
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,020
I won't make a big deal out of it.

458
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,500
Zi Rui,

459
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,460
do you remember

460
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,620
that my mother taught us to work hard.

461
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,340
The Crown Princess Election
is right around the corner.

462
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,980
I'd rather spend time on study

463
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,260
than waste time on her!

464
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
Don't you think?

465
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,420
I'm letting her off.

466
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,460
Young Master,

467
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,700
the new spies are in place already.

468
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,780
We are investigating around the city

469
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,820
into who made the bamboo tube.

470
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
I'm sure we'll find out

471
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,420
who was behind it soon.

472
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,060
One more thing.

473
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,620
The spy we once put in the Academy

474
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,380
found out something after

475
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,060
he was sent to the Second Princess's mansion.

476
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,700
He wants to talk to you in person.

477
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,180
Do you have time to meet him now?

478
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,660
I'll hit you!

479
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,820
Chen Qianqian, how come you are so cute?

480
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,700
Young Master?

481
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,540
Sure, bring him here.

482
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,580
Yes.

483
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,540
So cute!

484
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,820
Thank you for your compliment, Young Master!

485
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,220
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

486
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Young Master, greetings to you!

487
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,780
What's the emergency?

488
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,460
I suddenly remembered a secret rumor.

489
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,260
Maybe it'll help you to get the Dragon Bone.

490
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,060
Tell me.

491
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,860
The Second Princess Chen Chuchu
isn't Her Majesty's real daughter.

492
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,020
What?

493
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,940
Chen Chuchu isn't her real daughter?

494
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,220
And Chen Yuanyuan is disabled.

495
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,780
So, Chen Qianqian will be

496
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
the only successor of Huayuan City!

497
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
Young Master,

498
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,820
if we poison Chen Qianqian,

499
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,980
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

500
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,420
That'll be our chance to take it,

501
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,220
and your heart disease will be cured finally!

502
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,180
Then...

503
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,700
What about Chen Qianqian?

504
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,580
Chen...

505
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
The Dragon Bone can only save one person.

506
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,180
Chen Qianqian will die for sure.

507
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,340
Based on what I heard,

508
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,940
Her Majesty already had a sign of stroke.

509
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
If

510
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,660
she knows that her favorite daughter
died a violent death,

511
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,220
she'll be destroyed,

512
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,380
and Huayuan City will become leaderless.

513
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,580
By then,

514
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,580
you'll be recovered,

515
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,860
and we'll have no worries at all.

516
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,460
We can swing south and conquer Huayuan.

517
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,620
And the black stone mine in Huayuan...

518
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Young Master!

519
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,020
Smelting is the foundation
of our Xuanhu City.

520
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,100
Black stone mine
is extremely important to us!

521
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,220
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

522
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,820
You have to make a decision!

523
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,860
I need more time to think about it.

524
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,300
We can't rush it.

525
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,940
We can't rush it.

526
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,820
We can't rush it.

527
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,700
Here you go.

528
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,140
Naughty!

529
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,380
-Again! -Do it again!

530
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,140
How's your arm?

531
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,540
My arm? It's fine now!

532
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,780
Han Shuo cured me.

533
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,260
Good to know!

534
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,900
The fruits were just delivered

535
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,220
from Xuanhu City.

536
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,900
I brought some for you.

537
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,940
Then I have to eat now.

538
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,420
In case Han Shuo sees them.

539
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,860
I can ask the servant to give him some, too.

540
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,060
You don't understand.

541
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
I'm worried that he'll be homesick

542
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
if he sees the fruits from his hometown.

543
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,980
I'm being inconsiderate.

544
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,780
Young Master Han lives in Huayuan alone.

545
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,940
He must be very sad.

546
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,540
Not necessarily.

547
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,620
He only has the Dragon Bone in his mind.

548
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,100
Have a good night's sleep.

549
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,140
I'll visit you again in a few days.

550
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,900
Okay!

551
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,180
Young Master.

552
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,620
Your Highness.

553
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,540
I saw that Young Master Han just left,

554
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,060
and he seemed unhappy.

555
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,180
Oh, no!

556
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,620
Maybe he heard me!

557
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,220
He must have been jealous.

558
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,780
Before, when you

559
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,700
broke your arm or leg,

560
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,460
Minister Pei never visited you.

561
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,780
And now it was just a shoulder dislocation.

562
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,580
That's because of the friendship
between teacher and student.

563
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,580
The friendship between teacher and student.

564
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,660
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

565
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,900
Her Majesty will certainly save her
with the Dragon Bone.

566
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,540
Hey,

567
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,900
Han Shuo stays in our mansion,

568
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,700
so he's one of us.

569
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,540
We should have him

570
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,900
feel like home.

571
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,060
Your Highness, you mean...

572
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,420
How about we hold a birthday party for him?

573
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,620
Young Master's birthday date is a top secret.

574
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,020
How can we find out?

575
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,940
You know what?

576
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,220
About Han Shuo's birthday date,
five elements and eight characters,

577
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
horoscope and blood type,

578
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,220
I know them even better than his mom!

579
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,900
Look at you!

580
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,860
You useless jerk!

581
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,260
I'll teach you a lesson when we are home!

582
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,100
Hurry!

583
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,940
Listen,

584
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
eating one onion every day

585
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,380
will guarantee you a daughter.

586
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,500
So your mother-in-law
won't abuse you anymore.

587
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,420
Really?

588
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,180
Of course!

589
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,100
Take it.

590
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,860
Five coins.

591
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,540
The vegetables are here.

592
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,060
Just these two.

593
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,220
Look! Look!

594
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,020
He's exposing his legs in public!

595
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,260
How shameless!

596
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,620
How shameless!

597
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,020
He should make a living
in the Music and Dance Academy!

598
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,140
So embarrassing!

599
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,620
If he is taken advantage of,

600
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,180
he should only blame himself!

601
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,500
-He deserves it! -That's right!

602
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,500
-He deserves it! -Let's go!

603
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,460
What do you think

604
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,980
we should give to Han Shuo?

605
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,060
Why don't you ask your advisers?

606
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,140
They are only interested

607
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,380
in talented scholars and pretty ladies.

608
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,260
Their ideas will only be limited to
handkerchief, fan, sachet or jade pendant.

609
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,300
Too old-fashioned!

610
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,820
I heard

611
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
that women in Xuanhu City

612
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,020
would make shoes
and socks for their husbands.

613
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,620
Shoes?

614
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,580
Men always love shoes!

615
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
Then I'll buy shoes for him.

616
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,100
Is there a custom shop?

617
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,300
Yes.

618
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,420
Please come again.

619
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:39,940
Okay!

620
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,740
Introduce some clients to me! Take care!

621
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,740
Warning! Be careful!

622
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,140
Pack up the stall! Quick!

623
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,420
Well... What are they hiding from?

624
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,580
The city patrol is here?

625
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,260
You never paid when you bought things.

626
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,820
We owe money to the entire street.

627
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,700
They are hiding from me?

628
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,380
Because they don't have manners.

629
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,100
I will give you money, alright?

630
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,020
We'll pay cash!

631
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,740
Open your doors!

632
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,540
Come to my shop! Come on!

633
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,540
Your Highness, take a look!

634
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,140
I have some new calligraphy and paintings.

635
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,900
Your Highness, we have new cloth!

636
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,660
Come on! Take a look!

637
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,780
Your Highness!

638
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,660
Come and take a look at our lanterns.
We have multiple colors.

639
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,020
You only have cages, but no birds, right?

640
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,140
Your Highness, what do you want to buy?

641
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,980
Come in and take a look!

642
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,020
If there's anything you like,
we'll deliver it to your mansion.

643
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,140
We have a lot of stuff.

644
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,100
Take a look inside.

645
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,140
Please, come in!

646
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,580
You are back!

647
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,540
Are you worried that I collude with Xuanhu

648
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,820
and exchange letters?

649
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,900
Would you believe me if I told you

650
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,340
that the bamboo tube started it?

651
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,260
You must be kidding.

652
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,540
Now, forget it.

653
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,020
I'm here for a reason.

654
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,380
Close your eyes.

655
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,900
Did I do anything

656
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,220
that made you mad,

657
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,860
so that you want to get rid of me?

658
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,380
No!

659
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,260
It's not like what you thought.

660
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,340
I kinda wish that you were here to kill me.

661
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
What did you say?

662
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,220
I'm not in the mood to joke.

663
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,500
I see that you've been upset
these couple of days.

664
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,780
Is it because of me?

665
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,700
No.

666
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,780
How do I measure his chest and waist?

667
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,820
I want to kill her,

668
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,220
but she is so innocent

669
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,740
that she's even hugging me?

670
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,460
Okay! I'm good now! Bye!

671
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,380
The Third Princess

672
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,860
really liked the cloth

673
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,900
that your shop delivered.

674
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,500
We'll buy from your shop again.

675
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,900
I also brought

676
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,420
something else this time.

677
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,460
A few days ago,

678
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,580
you asked us

679
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,220
to make a custom-made sealing wax bamboo tube.

680
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,540
My boss said

681
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,300
the Third Princess never
ordered anything in small amount,

682
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,660
so we made 500.

683
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,780
The extra 499

684
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,300
will be given to the Third Princess

685
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,820
for free.

686
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,500
Alright.

687
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,060
Then I'll take them
on behalf of the Third Princess.

688
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,620
Okay.

689
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,580
Now, you guys,

690
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,780
take them to the kitchen in the back yard.

691
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,100
See you!

692
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,940
Okay.

693
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,860
Careful!

694
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,580
(Accumulate achievements
to influence the descendants)

695
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,580
If we poison Chen Qianqian,

696
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,900

Happy birthday to Young Master Han!

718
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,260
Happy birthday!

719
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,220
Today is my birthday?

720
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,860
How did you know that?

721
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,900
Not only do I know your birthday date,

722
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,380
I also know you are 186cm in height,

723
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,820
you weigh 75 kg,

724
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,940
your blood type is O.

725
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,180
You like black,

726
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,740
don't like rainy days,

727
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,300
your favorite food is noodle soup
cooked by your mom,

728
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
you don't like ginger.

729
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,620
What else do you know?

730
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,420
I also know

731
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,340
that when you were born,

732
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,700
everyone in Xuanhu City

733
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,900
said that you'd be a rarely-seen prodigy.

734
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,900
But unfortunately, when you were 16,

735
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,620
you were diagnosed with heart disease.

736
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
The doctors said

737
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,260
that you would die before 20.

738
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,300
Ever since then,

739
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,780
your character has changed.

740
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,700
What would the life be like

741
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,100
for a man who knows when he'll die?

742
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,660
It's like countdown every day.

743
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,260
You blame God for his unfairness.

744
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,980
You hate that you can't change your fate.

745
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,620
You want to live.

746
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,620
So you'd rather do anything

747
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,220
as long as you can cure your disease.

748
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Han Shuo,

749
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,780
trust me,

750
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,980
there's one person who can cure you,

751
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,020
and she'll be the one who loves you the most.

752
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,780
So, don't give up!

753
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,220
You have to stick it out to the end!

754
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,500
When people learned

755
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,260
that I would die before 20,

756
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,220
they all tried to comfort me,

757
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,500
as if I were already dead.

758
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,740
But you actually believe that I can be saved.

759
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,900
Because you didn't meet me before.

760
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,340
Why do you give me that look again?

761
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
You've been upset for days.

762
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,020
You looked much better
when you smiled just now.

763
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
Does it matter

764
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,620
whether I smile or not?

765
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,860
Of course, it does.

766
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,180
If a beauty doesn't smile under the moon,

767
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,460
then the staggering night view

768
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,500
will be a waste.

769
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,940
Sounds like

770
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,580
Your Highness wants to
spend the night with me.

771
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,860
I am spending the night with you
right now, aren't I?

772
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,940
It's hotpot.

773
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,380
Young Master, please.

774
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,620
No matter what is bothering you,

775
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,740
nothing cannot be solved by one hotpot meal.

776
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,420
If there is,

777
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,980
then have two hotpot meals!

778
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,460
What kind of theory is that?

779
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,100
This is the law of hotpot!

780
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,340
The second rule of this law

781
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,220
is that if you want to test

782
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,100
a person's real heart,

783
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,220
then you can see if she'll give you

784
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,460
the first thing she cooked.

785
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,860
This is the first thing I cooked.

786
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,140
I'll give it to you.

787
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,820
I have heart disease.

788
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,140
I can't eat spicy things.

789
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,940
It's okay.

790
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,180
I like spicy food. I can eat it.

791
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,420
Luckily, I prepared double-flavor hotpot.

792
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
Look the spicy soup and the non-spicy soup.

793
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,180
They have completely different flavors,

794
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,540
yet they are put in the same pot.

795
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,300
Since you like spicy food,

796
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,740
wouldn't it be better

797
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,100
if you got a spicy hotpot?

798
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,740
In that case,

799
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,180
you can't eat any.

800
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,060
Plus,

801
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,620
the fun part about having hotpot
is eating it together.

802
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,100
As the so-called "Seek agreement
while shelving differences,"

803
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,300
people with different opinions

804
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,740
can certainly get along.

805
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,820
Double-flavor hotpot
must include two flavors.

806
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,180
Neither of the two can be missing.

807
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,300
Neither of the two can be missing.

808
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,700
Come on, start eating.

809
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,820
If you don't eat,

810
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,060
I'll have them all.

811
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,940
Oh, I see!

812
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,540
You want wine, right?

813
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,460
I've prepared fruit wine.

814
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,980
I know with your heart condition,
you can't drink wine.

815
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,180
But the fruit wine

816
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,700
contains very little alcohol,
it won't make you drunk.

817
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,740
It's a special day today,

818
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,700
I'll drink a little, too.

819
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,620
Toast to you!

820
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,220
Okay!

821
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,900
Cheers, Your Highness!

822
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,620
Can't believe

823
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,340
that we can sit here and drink together.

824
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,060
Here.

825
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Banana,

826
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,100
let me toast to you again!

827
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,860
Thank you for sparing the orange's life!

828
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,260
Cheers!

829
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,460
Don't worry.

830
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,580
You have me.

831
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,260
I won't watch you die.

832
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,780
There must be a miracle!

833
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,140
If there's not, I'll create one!

834
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
In fact, I've found a way to cure my disease.

835
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,980
But I don't want to use that.

836
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,580
The Third Princess

837
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,060
