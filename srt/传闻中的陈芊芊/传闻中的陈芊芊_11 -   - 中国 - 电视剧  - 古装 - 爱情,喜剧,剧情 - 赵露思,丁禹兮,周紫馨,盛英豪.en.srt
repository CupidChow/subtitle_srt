=The Romance of Tiger and Rose=

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 11)

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,580
(Qingfeng Tea House)

25
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,180
This Cherry stands for Yingying.

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,260
It is the advisor of the Apple.

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,900
It seems harmless.

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,500
But actually, it keeps its own counsel.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,540
In childhood, Cherry was saved by Apple.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,540
So it fell head over heels for Apple

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,820
and it's very loyal to Apple.

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,420
Apple have succeeded in many doings,

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,780
which is actually
attributed to Cherry's counsel.

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,980
Besides, Apple defeated Banana.

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,580
Well, the Third Princess,

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,860
the story is becoming more and more complex.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,060
We haven't sorted out
the triangular relationship

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,140
between Orange, Apple and Banana yet.

39
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,940
Why did you bring in another character?

40
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,140
It is not complicated.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,020
I brought in Cherry

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,700
to help me sort out the relations
between characters.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,260
It has been written into the original script.

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,860
Cherry saw that Apple had a thing for Banana.

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,220
Thus, on Weimeng Mountain, Apple tried all means

46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,460
like the typical trapping and drugging.

47
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,740
It put all those means
into practice one by one.

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,460
Finally, Banana fell into the trap

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,380
and started fancying Apple.

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,100
This time, as long as

51
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,860
Cherry could play its role
on Weimeng Mountain

52
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,980
as specified in the original plots,

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,020
Han Shuo and Chu...

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,300
Then, Banana and Apple

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,300
will come to fruition in love.

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,300
Then I will be able to

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,580
rest and wait for the finale.

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,300
Now the plots have changed too much.

59
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,780
I am very curious.

60
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,740
How should Cherry act

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,820
to clean up the mess

62
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,020
made by Orange in the past.

63
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,780
Qianqian.

64
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,900
Be careful.

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,860
Su Ziying, how could you?

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
I implore you not to misunderstand,
Young Master Han.

67
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm just worried that the strong wind

68
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
might cause Her Highness to catch a cold.

69
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,660
If I did anything improper,

70
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
please forgive me.

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,620
What are you doing?

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,900
Why did you make Yingying kneel down?

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,260
I didn't make him do that.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,460
Your Highness,

75
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,180
I have offended Young Master Han.

76
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,340
So he punished me lightly.

77
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,900
Sorry to have disturbed Your Highness.

78
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,420
When did I punish you?

79
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,340
Young Master Han,

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,620
if you are annoyed with me,

81
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,060
I am willing to be beaten and punished.

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,820
However,

83
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,540
you mustn't misunderstand

84
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,020
my Young Master's kindness to Her Highness.

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,340
Did I say a word about Pei Heng?

86
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,460
Han Shuo,

87
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,820
it is true that Pei Heng sent Yingying here

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,340
only to take care of me.

89
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,180
Moreover,

90
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,340
Yingying is well-behaved and obedient.

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,660
Don't always think others
are ill-intentioned.

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,460
OK?

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,340
Yingying, get into the carriage.

94
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,260
I want to have a talk with you.

95
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,860
Young Master,

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,460
you have been thumping your chest these days.

97
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,100
Has your heart disease relapsed?

98
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,900
It is not the heart disease.

99
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,540
I am suffering from the chest tightness.

100
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,940
Han Shuo,

101
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,420
go consult with Chuchu

102
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,620
about our itinerary today.

103
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
As for you two,

104
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,900
one is both brainy and brawny

105
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,820
and the other is good at governing troops.

106
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,740
With you two here,

107
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,660
I feel a lot more at ease.

108
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
You two must have a good discussion

109
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,900
in a detailed fashion.

110
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,740
Have you got it?

111
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,340
Just go.

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,340
Your Highness.

113
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,940
Young Master Han.

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,100
Weimeng Mt. features complex terrain
and can be easily guarded.

115
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,180
Do you have any sound strategies

116
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,220
to ensure an immediate victory.

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Meng Guo is pretentious.

118
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,700
Learning that we are coming
suppress his forces,

119
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,260
he won't hole up in the mountain.

120
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,660
Look! We shall get stationed here.

121
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,660
Then we will find a chance to lure him out

122
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,380
to capture him.

123
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,020
But we still need bait.

124
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,420
In my view, Su Ziying is a good choice.

125
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Su Ziying?

126
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,460
Just kidding.

127
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,580
Su Ziying is just a humble wretch

128
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,020
who is adept in artful speech.

129
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,180
What capability and virtue does he have

130
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,780
to lure Meng Guo down the mountain?

131
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,860
As the Young Master of Xuanhu City,

132
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,700
I will put the word out

133
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,100
to get him to come at me by then.

134
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,300
(An aura of orchid's elegance)

135
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,980
Your Highness,

136
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,220
here is the sesame paste, ginseng tea,

137
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,540
the pearl barley dew, and the bird's nest.

138
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,820
They are all premium tonics.

139
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,340
In such beautiful days,

140
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,500
only a worthless person like me

141
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,380
stays at home to kill time.

142
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,620
Life is short.

143
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,460
When can I be freed from all this?

144
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,140
Your Highness,

145
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,060
don't be self-despising.

146
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,580
The Third Princess is inferior to you.

147
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,980
Even if she has been made Crown Princess,

148
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,580
she continues idling away day in, day out.

149
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,140
Minister Pei just handled
the official documents for her.

150
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
Your Highness, Mr. Su is present.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,660
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

152
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Why are you here?

153
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,740
Where is Qianqian?

154
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,020
the Crown Princess has been sent
to Weimeng Mountain to suppress bandits.

155
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,660
She has left at around 8 a.m.

156
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,220
She ordered me

157
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,620
to accompany you through
the rehabilitation every day.

158
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,300
Qianqian has gone to suppress the bandits?

159
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,980
Zi Nian,

160
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
didn't you say Qianqian

161
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
was idling away all the time?

162
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,780
I will skip the rehabilitation.

163
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,860
Zi Nian.

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,060
Your Highness.

165
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,340
Why are you still here?

166
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,980
Why is Your Highness so childish?

167
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,660
You wrote your will in the form of diary.

168
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,340
You!

169
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,300
How dare you!

170
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
You mustn't read them.

171
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,220
Your Highness,

172
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,260
you really

173
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,900
don't want me to read them?

174
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,900
Read them if you insist.

175
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
This is the first letter.

176
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,940
New Year's Eve in the 9th year
during Empress Fengde's reign

177
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,380
Her Majesty and my third sister
played on ice.

178
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,300
I was itching for joining them.

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,220
Your Highness wanted to go skating.

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,340
This is the second one.

181
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,340
Your Highness.

182
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,820
I will read the second one.

183
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,260
The Dragon Boat Festival in the 11th year
during Empress Fengde's reign

184
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,900
Third sister rode a horse
in the street and fell off it.

185
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,900
I envied her so much.

186
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,660
Your Highness,

187
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,220
so you wanted to ride a horse.

188
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I, your servant can fulfill your wish.

189
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,340
The next one.

190
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,780
The third diary.

191
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
Fengde...

192
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,740
The year is not important.

193
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,380
As Your Highness grew up,

194
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,620
you wanted to try more and more things.

195
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,300
Fly a kite.

196
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,620
Your Highness,

197
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,140
you have never flown a kite?

198
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,580
You also wanted to go to the Music
and Dance Academy.

199
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,060
The Music and Dance Academy

200
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,180
is not a good place.

201
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,660
But, they all have visited it.

202
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,940
Your Highness need not go there.

203
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,820
Back then, the service of all musicians

204
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,700
couldn't outdo my hearty smile.

205
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
Let me read this last one.

206
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,020
Your Highness

207
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
has put down all your
inner thoughts in the letters.

208
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,060
Now they are dropped onto the ground.

209
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,700
What a pity!

210
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,900
I just put down some random thoughts.

211
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,780
As long as Your Highness agrees to practice

212
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,300
referring to the brochure given by the Crown Princess,

213
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,660
I will try my best

214
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,340
to enable you to ride a horse,
go skating and fly a kite.

215
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,740
Besides,

216
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,900
you need not go to the Music
and Dance Academy.

217
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,580
No matter what the musicians there can do,

218
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,540
I can do the same, too.

219
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,100
I didn't want to go there.

220
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,620
I just wrote the words randomly.

221
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,780
You are holding one in your hands.

222
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
No matter what wish

223
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,380
you have put down in the letter,

224
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,540
I will help you fulfill your wish.

225
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,340
Really?

226
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,180
Sure.

227
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,340
Your Highness,

228
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,980
are you thinking that I come from
the Music and Dance Academy,

229
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,380
so I am used to cheating women

230
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,380
and breaking my words?

231
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Of course not.

232
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,020
You are not like others.

233
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,020
Forget it.

234
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,220
You don't know

235
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,260
what I wrote in this letter at all.

236
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,140
I won't take your words seriously.

237
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,540
Then, for the next, we shall...

238
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,820
Let's practice.

239
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,740
OK.

240
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Mr. Su,

241
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,260
from now on,

242
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,020
you will be our
Risheng Mansion's honored guest.

243
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,180
It is the Crown Princess's duty
to suppress the bandits.

244
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,220
How come in the end,

245
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,860
it has become your business?

246
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,100
She is the Crown Princess.

247
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,380
Though you're working for her,

248
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,340
by then, she will take all the credit.

249
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,860
But if things go wrong,
you will be held accountable.

250
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,980
It is unfair.

251
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,940
Never mind.

252
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,020
It is no use saying these words now.

253
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,020
Don't you think the air in this carriage

254
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,100
is oxygen-deficient?

255
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,900
I think it is too crowded

256
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,060
for three people.

257
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,980
Let one of us get out.

258
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,980
I am a humble servant.

259
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,860
I will get out.

260
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,420
Nonetheless,

261
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,940
it has been a long travel.

262
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,780
Her Highness must have been tired.

263
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,260
I have mastered the massage.

264
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,980
You can do that?

265
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,300
A small piece of cake.

266
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,820
Could you please get out to ride the horse?

267
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,860
I want the massage.

268
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,420
I can do it, too.

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,300
I will give you the massage.

270
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,660
In my memory, you can't.

271
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,740
I can.

272
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,820
What are you doing?

273
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,500
Let him massage me first.

274
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,700
Then I will learn it.

275
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,140
Han Shuo, you can't bully Yingying.

276
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,500
Who bullied him?

277
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,300
He likes kneeling down.

278
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,780
Maybe Pei Heng taught him to do so.

279
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,700
For no reason,

280
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,980
why did you mention Pei Heng again?

281
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,340
Pei Heng! Pei Heng! Pei Heng!

282
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,500
Your Highness,

283
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,740
don't bicker with

284
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,340
Young Master Han for my sake.

285
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,740
We didn't quarrel, right?

286
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,700
No, we didn't.

287
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,620
We didn't.

288
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,140
You want a massage, right?

289
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,660
I will massage you.

290
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,140
Why does one man pick on another man?

291
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,540
It feels good!

292
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,220
This letter

293
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,620
was written when the Third Princess got married.

294
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,580
If my memory doesn't lie to me,

295
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,660
Your Highness made a wish that

296
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,020
you could find someone to love.

297
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,780
Su Mu didn't know his inferiority

298
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,460
and dared to promise you this.

299
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,500
Geez! Your Highness!

300
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
Have you fallen for him?

301
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,980
He is the number one
of the Music and Dance Academy.

302
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,260
He is just a musician.

303
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,940
He doesn't look down upon me.

304
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,380
Why should I make light of him?

305
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
As long as the man is good to Your Highness

306
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,940
and makes Your Highness happy,

307
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,220
he will be the right one.

308
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
God, please bless Her Highness
with early recovery

309
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,020
and may her wishes come true.

310
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,820
Take care.

311
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,700
Our inn

312
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,340
used to enjoy business boom.

313
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
Since the bandits on the Weimeng Mountain

314
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,900
began to harass the passing trade caravans,

315
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,820
well,

316
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,220
our business has been stagnant.

317
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,940
Our inn is old and in bad repair.

318
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,300
We can only provide
a limited number of rooms.

319
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,780
I don't know what arrangements I should make.

320
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,380
Prepare three high-quality rooms

321
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,580
for my master and the two princesses.

322
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Three rooms?

323
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,540
Won't Young Master
and the Crown Princess share one room?

324
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,580
Right. Then the Crown Princess and I will...

325
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,660
You asked too much.

326
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,220
My master made such arrangements

327
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,700
for his own purpose.

328
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,100
I got it.

329
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,380
I will do it right away.

330
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,660
Bai Ji,

331
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,260
what is my purpose on earth?

332
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,780
It hurts a lot.

333
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,620
Young Master,

334
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,580
you have taken the drastic measure.

335
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,220
Though the Crown Princess is important,

336
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,340
what is on your mind now

337
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,980
should be the forces of Weimeng Mountain.

338
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,420
You want to take this chance
to subdue Meng Guo

339
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,420
to make him work for you

340
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,660
and make him escort the trade caravans
of our Xuanhu City.

341
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,300
It is a serious matter.

342
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,260
I guess you don't want the Crown Princess to know it.

343
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,940
So you must take separate rooms.

344
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,500
Young Master, is my analysis right?

345
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,020
Yes.

346
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,980
I have such a plan indeed.

347
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,460
Young Master, you are circumspect
and far-sighted.

348
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,620
Young Master, you are wise.

349
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,580
Looking back smilingly,

350
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,820
a lady that is so slim and graceful.

351
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,940
Her eyes are slightly-parted

352
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,820
looking like bows in the moonlight.

353
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,020
In the deep forest of the back mountain,

354
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,300
I will wait for your arrival, my lady.

355
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Holding a sword with a heroic bearing,

356
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,460
a man looks so imposing.

357
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,860
Spurring a horse with the raised whip,

358
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,940
a man seems so domineering.

359
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,020
In the deep forest of the back mountain,

360
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,580
I will wait for your arrival, dear sir.

361
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,460
You two,

362
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,540
hand over

363
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,060
one letter to Chuchu

364
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,580
and the other to Young Master Han.

365
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,620
Remember

366
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,260
not to let others know

367
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,260
I wrote them.

368
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,340
Got it.

369
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,140
Let the plots

370
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,260
develop more quickly and surprisingly.

371
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,900
Declaring love on Weimeng Mountain.

372
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,620
A lady that is so slim and graceful.

373
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,060
He asked me to meet him on the back mountain.

374
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,500
Why did the Second Princess
ask you to the back mountain?

375
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,180
Holding a sword with a heroic bearing.

376
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,900
Could it be possible that

377
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,500
she wants us to...

378
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,420
Laugh!

379
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,980
Laugh out aloud!

380
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,380
This is how an idol drama should be.

381
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,020
Such a feast to eyes.

382
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,260
Your Highness.

383
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
Young Master Han, why did you

384
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,940
ask me to meet you here?

385
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,020
Your Highness, please strike.

386
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,900
Strike?

387
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,420
Since you mentioned holding a sword,

388
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
I guess our battle in the Music
and Dance Academy,

389
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,060
has failed to satisfy you.

390
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,140
Taking this chance,

391
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,420
let's battle it out again.

392
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,700
We are facing the fight with the bandits.

393
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,820
It suits the occasion.

394
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,180
Battle it out?

395
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,500
Isn't this a date?

396
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,540
The Music and Dance Academy... Battle...

397
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,140
So I misunderstood it.

398
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,100
You didn't.

399
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,780
Han Shuo did.

400
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,140
Your Highness, please strike.

401
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,220
It doesn't matter.

402
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,260
The hero and heroine

403
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,820
may fall for each other
while crossing swords.

404
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,220
In the martial art competition,

405
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,500
they will exchange blows

406
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,340
and can't avoid physical contact.

407
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,620
Thus, they may develop feelings
for each other.

408
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,940
As I said.

409
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,860
Go on!

410
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,620
This is not good.

411
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,300
The idol drama is turning
into the Kung Fu drama.

412
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,380
You should go easy on her.

413
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,900
How can you be so serious

414
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,380
when battling with a girl?

415
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,500
You won't be popular with girls.

416
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,220
What should I do? What should I do?

417
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,340
I got distracted.

418
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,980
Please punish me, Your Highness.

419
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,620
Who is there? Show yourself.

420
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,420
Me.

421
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,580
It is me.

422
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,860
Qianqian.

423
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,340
You...

424
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,940
I

425
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,140
was passing by.

426
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,980
By chance,

427
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,300
by accident and without intention,

428
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,460
I saw you and Chuchu battling here.

429
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,740
So I hid myself quietly

430
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
not to disturb you.

431
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,900
Then I watched you for a while.

432
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,740
Master Han, you fought so valiantly.

433
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,660
Chuchu,

434
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,940
you have fought hard.

435
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,660
In this battle, you two

436
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,740
can be said to

437
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,580
be a good match,

438
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,660
to be equal in strength,

439
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,180
to be on a par

440
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,220
and to be similarly skilled in martial arts.

441
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,100
Bravo!

442
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,740
You are a heaven-made match.

443
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,740
A heaven-made match. A perfect match.

444
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,500
I am not on a par with her.

445
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,660
I won just now.

446
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,100
So Young Master Han, you asked me to meet you here

447
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,660
for the purpose of showing me up.

448
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,260
No, it is not like that, Chuchu.

449
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,100
Don't you see... second sister...

450
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,420
Did I fight bravely just now?

451
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,500
Yes.

452
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,100
Then I will feel assured.

453
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,100
Didn't you see I was just being polite?

454
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,940
Chuchu is a girl of noble birth.

455
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,860
But you humiliated her so much.

456
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,340
She must be very sad now.

457
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Since we were in a battle,

458
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,180
if I had gone easy on her,

459
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,940
that would have been disrespect to her.

460
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,500
So, do you mean that

461
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,740
if I hadn't stopped you,

462
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,220
you would have beaten her up.

463
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,620
Since it was a friendly battle,

464
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,540
I wouldn't hurt her.

465
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,660
Her life would not be in danger.

466
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,700
Besides, she is your sister. I...

467
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,540
I got it.

468
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,900
You are blaming me
for applying too much strength.

469
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,860
It is my fault.

470
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,060
I shouldn't have given you
the one-track-minded persona.

471
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,820
A person like you

472
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,620
is basically not fit for the idol drama.

473
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,260
Well, what am I not fit for?

474
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,060
Your Highness,

475
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
wait for me!

476
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,020
Master Han, in our Huayuan City,

477
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,860
there is a saying, a man's best dowry

478
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,580
is his chastity, purity and self-respect.

479
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,180
Please act prudently in the coming days,

480
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,780
observe the men's ethics,

481
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,420
and try not to rile the Third Princess.

482
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,620
I...

483
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,020
Young Master, what did Su Ziying mean?

484
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,820
He might mean that...

485
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,620
Qianqian thought I met
the Second Princess for a date.

486
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,460
It seems that it is a wise move for me

487
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,140
to have brought her to suppress the bandits.

488
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,300
She

489
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,940
got jealous of me.

490
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,620
Yingying, you have seen it.

491
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,260
What do you think of

492
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,060
the relation between Han Shuo
and my second sister?

493
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,060
I think that

494
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,340
Xuanhu City and Huayuan City
have different folk customs.

495
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,220
Are Your Highness also suspecting that

496
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,700
Master Han is harboring evil designs?

497
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,940
He isn't harboring any ill intent.

498
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,180
Because from the very beginning,

499
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,500
he has been acting oddly.

500
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,300
Normally,

501
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,260
he should be closer to Chuchu.

502
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,980
I don't understand.

503
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,940
Help me figure out a way

504
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,300
to push Han Shuo to Chuchu's side.

505
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,260
Your Highness, I have been
taught by Mr. Pei

506
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,100
to be kind to people and behave properly.

507
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,620
I dare not do improper things.

508
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,260
Don't pretend in front of me.

509
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,900
Because you are resourceful,

510
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,380
I brought you here to suppress the bandits.

511
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,140
You can take it that

512
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,180
I

513
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,900
got tired of Han Shuo

514
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,700
and asked you to figure out a solution for me

515
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,180
to scuttle our marriage.

516
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,700
Such is the thing.

517
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,300
Since Your Highness gave me the order,

518
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,620
I would go through fire and water to do it.

519
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,020
But I am slow-witted.

520
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,340
How should I do it?

521
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,140
Please give me instructions, Your Highness.

522
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,180
When suppressing bandits,
perils are unavoidable.

523
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,780
I think the love between two people

524
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,780
will be born out of mutual trust

525
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,500
and interdependence.

526
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,140
They...

527
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,380
Rest assured, Your Highness.

528
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
I got it. I will do as you said.

529
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,620
He got it.

530
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,500
But I haven't got it quite well.

531
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,980
Something is happening.

532
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,580
Report!

533
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,740
Your Highness,

534
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,020
while Young Master Han was leading
the troops on patrol,

535
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,460
they were ambushed by the bandits.

536
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,460
Zi Zhu,

537
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,740
you lead men to aid Young Master Han.

538
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
I will go check the situation
and come right away.

539
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,060
Be careful, Your Highness.

540
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,460
Young Master, haven't you been ambushed?

541
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,820
What ambush?

542
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,940
Where is the Second Princess?

543
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,020
Report came that

544
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,860
you have been ambushed by the bandits.

545
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,380
So the Second Princess sent me to aid you.

546
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,460
Where is the messenger?

547
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,380
I am afraid Meng Guo
is trying to lure us away.

548
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,580
The Second Princess is in danger now.

549
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,740
Zi Zhu, lead the way.

550
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,460
Yes, sir!

551
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,500
If mother comes to know that

552
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,020
in the course of suppressing bandits,

553
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,780
I fall into the trap accidentally

554
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,220
and fail to complete the mission,

555
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,180
she will surely scold me.

556
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,860
Master Han,

557
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,060
could the mountain bandits have arrived

558
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,620
and she's been taken by Meng Guo?

559
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,260
Qianqian and her second sister are close.

560
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,580
She can't bear to see her sister in danger.

561
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,860
Let's find her first.

562
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,020
Master Han, why are you here?

563
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,620
I came to save you.

564
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,780
Your leg has got hurt.

565
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,260
Let me help you handle it.

566
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,660
Your Highness is brave and strong.

567
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,060
If Qianqian was in your position,

568
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,500
she would cry loudly.

569
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
You lied to me, Young Master Han.

570
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,300
Qianqian fears no pain.

571
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,820
Come on.

572
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,500
Sorry to trouble you, Young Master Han.

573
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,140
Don't mention it.

574
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,860
Your foot just got better.

575
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,300
I will carry you up on my back.

576
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,780
Thank you, Young Master Han.

577
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,260
Zi Rui,

578
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,340
I saw some food stock in the kitchen.

579
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,620
So I wanted to cook congee
for the Third Princess tomorrow morning.

580
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,260
But I am not good at cooking.

581
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,940
I can't even cook the congee.

582
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,340
OK. I will work on it.

583
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,580
The Third Princess, I got everything done.

584
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,660
At this time, Young Master Han and the Second Princess

585
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,260
should be having a good time together.

586
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,980
It happened so fast.

587
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,180
Come on.

588
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,460
In childhood, I took Qianqian
for pack hunting.

589
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,260
She liked this kind of wild fruit best.

590
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,580
Does she still like it?

591
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Who knows?

592
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,580
Her feelings for things never last long.

593
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,780
Why did you pack it?

594
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,060
I will bring it back to Qianqian.

595
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,380
She is not used to the cold food
for the marching troops.

596
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,340
If I had known Young Master Han
is so brave and handsome

597
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,580
as well as is so devoted to love,

598
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,420
I shouldn't have let Qianqian have you.

599
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,180
Why did you say so, Your Highness?

600
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,700
Back then, when you entered our city,

601
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,780
mother intended to marry me to you.

602
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,020
But Qianqian was taking you
by force in the street,

603
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,140
which resulted in your marriage
with her by chance.

604
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,700
This is the trick fate played on us.

605
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,100
If I were given another chance,

606
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,740
I hope I would
be riding a horse in the street

607
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,220
and be taking you from the street.

608
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,380
If time could go back,

609
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,780
what would be your choice, Young Master Han?

610
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,300
Though I came to know Qianqian by accident,

611
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,100
after a series of happenings,

612
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,060
I have developed deep feelings for her.

613
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,900
If there were a second chance,

614
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,780
I would still choose Qianqian,
who is pure-hearted,

615
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,540
upright and kind.

616
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,900
With your talent, Your Highness,

617
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,540
you will definitely make
great achievements in the future.

618
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,060
Your Highness, I wish that

619
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,700
you could enjoy endless blessings.

620
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,660
Just as I expected.

621
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,740
People in the whole Huayuan City

622
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,620
know you love Qianqian.

623
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,940
But she doesn't know herself.

624
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
Qianqian

625
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,580
is pure-hearted.

626
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,580
There is a place for me in her heart.

627
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,260
On the marching journey,
we can't make a fire.

628
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,820
Sorry to make you suffer.

629
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,740
Thank you, Young Master Han.

630
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,900
Though I am a noble princess,

631
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,700
people seldom treat me so nicely.

632
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,620
You can't be serious, Your Highness.

633
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,940
Qianqian

634
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,940
has been loved by all people since childhood.

635
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,380
She is spoiled and willful

636
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,500
while I am used
to currying favor with people.

637
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,100
Mother hasn't been good to me

638
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
as she has been nice to Qianqian.

639
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,900
Qianqian doesn't take anything to heart,

640
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,380
but she has everything.

641
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,740
I tried my best in everything,

642
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,060
but I got nothing.

643
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,020
Young Master Han, tell me,

644
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,180
is this my destiny?

645
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,660
You are just having a hard time temporarily.

646
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,580
Don't mind it too much.

647
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,740
Things will change for the better

648
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,460
and you will have your moments.

649
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,780
People in the whole Huayuan City

650
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,740
know you love Qianqian.

651
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,900
But she doesn't know herself.

652
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,780
Qianqian is pure-hearted.

653
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,660
There is a place for me in her heart.

654
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,460
Is it true that

655
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,580
Qianqian doesn't know my feelings?

656
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,260
They didn't come back last night.

657
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,580
Does a date have to take so long?

658
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Where have you led them?

659
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,580
They fell into a trap.

660
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,020
Trap?

661
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,700
Who dug it?

662
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,500
You dug it?

663
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,020
Isn't this your idea, Your Highness?

664
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,180
My idea?

665
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,420
When suppressing bandits,
traps are unavoidable.

666
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,740
When suppressing bandits,
perils are unavoidable.

667
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,300
Don't you know?

668
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,340
You took traps for perils.

669
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,060
I made a mistake.

670
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,620
But you said that

671
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,020
two people' feelings

672
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,540
are born out of mutual trust

673
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,060
and interdependence.

674
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,860
That doesn't mean you can dig a pit

675
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,860
and bury them.

676
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,340
If Meng Guo passed by

677
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,860
and filled up the pit with earth,

678
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,660
they would lose their lives.

679
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,140
I have been careless.

680
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,420
Please punish me, Your Highness.

681
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,260
How should I?

682
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,340
Where did you trap them? Go save them!

683
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,860
Hurry!

684
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,220
the Crown Princess, the Crown Princess.

685
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,380
Look at the food I prepared for you.

686
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,620
It is congee? Why?

687
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,460
You made a fire?

688
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,220
When I went to cook the congee this morning,

689
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,100
the pot had been put above the fire.

690
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,260
You made the fire?

691
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,060
It has been a tiring journey.

692
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,060
Seeing Your Highness could only eat cold food

693
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
and had no hot meals,

694
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,020
I decided to cook a bowl of congee

695
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,220
to warm your stomach.

696
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,140
While on the march,

697
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,740
in order to keep our traces secret,

698
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,820
we are forbidden to make a fire.

699
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
Hurry to circulate the order.

700
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,820
Set out immediately!

701
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,100
If Meng Guo came to attack,

702
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,340
in the absence of Han Shuo and Chuchu, I...

703
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,020
Well,

704
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
I have to lead some men to save them.

705
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,660
In case that Meng Guo find them first...

706
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,340
Report!

707
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,820
Your Highness,

708
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,620
the mountain bandits are coming at us.

709
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,980
They are coming?

710
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,780
Run! Run! Run!

711
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,060
Well. Well.

712
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:29,060
Capture Chen Qianqian! Make her my wife!

713
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,820
Hurry! Hurry!

714
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,780
Be careful!

715
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,580
What should we do?

716
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,780
Your Highness, run away quickly!

717
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,980
I will cover for you.

718
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
Get out of here quickly!

719
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,540
I am...

720
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,460
No! No! No! I am not.

721
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Your Highness, take flight!

722
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,180
Your Highness!

723
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,500
Shut up!

724
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,060
Your Highness!

725
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,980
Your Highness! Run! Your Highness!

726
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,820
Are you all right?

727
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,020
Go help Chuchu quickly!

728
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,700
Are you kidding?

729
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,820
How can I leave you alone?

730
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,900
Don't mind me.

731
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,820
It is not easy for you to have a chance

732
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,740
to spend a whole night
with Chuchu in the trap.

733
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,780
Hurry to help her.

734
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,100
How do you know we were in the trap?

735
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,020
Han Shuo, are you all right?

736
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,860
-Zi Rui, take Qianqian somewhere to hide.
-Does it hurt?

737
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,380
-Yes! -Han Shuo!

738
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:00,820
Hurry!

739
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,340
Does it hurt?

740
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,740
Hurry!

741
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,460
Han Shuo!

742
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,860
Report to Your Highness.

743
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,820
Here is Meng Guo,
ringleader of the Weimeng Mountain bandits.

744
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,380
Weimeng Mountain is located at the junction

745
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,740
of Huayuan City and Xuanhu City.

746
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,700
Our trade caravans pass it inevitably.

747
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,220
Meng Guo occupies it and robs the passers-by.

748
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,780
The passing trade caravans suffer a lot.

749
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,260
Now he is captured.

750
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,460
How should we deal with him?

751
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,020
Han Shuo,
hurry to put in a good word for him.

752
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,700
In the original script,

753
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,900
Meng Guo was a right-hand man of you.

754
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,060
Since he is caught, he should be killed.

755
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,900
Mother sent us here

756
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,620
for nothing else, but this matter.

757
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,300
Why is "kill" said so easily?

758
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,340
It is frightening.

759
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,780
In your opinion, the Crown Princess,

760
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,540
what should we do with him?

761
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,140
I...

762
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,180
How about your opinion, Young Master Han?

763
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,500
Young Master Han, do you want this man?

764
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,140
Fine. I will keep him alive.

765
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,780
Keep him...

766
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,380
A real man can be killed, but not humiliated.

767
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,340
It is a pity that I was defeated.

768
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,100
Otherwise,

769
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,220
I will take her to my mountain

770
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,820
and make her my wife.

771
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,900
We can live a happy life.

772
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,580
Take my banner here.

773
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,620
Where is my banner?

774
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,980
What banner?

775
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,740
I don't know.

776
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,260
Capture Chen Qianqian!

777
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,900
Make her my wife!

778
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,540
Then he should be beheaded.

779
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,300
Behead?

780
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,700
Well, don't you want him to work for you?

781
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,740
Think about the forces
and mines of Weimeng Mountain.

782
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,180
Don't give up on him.

783
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,500
He harbors ill intent towards you.

784
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,700
If you don't want him, I will.

785
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,300
Meng Guo has evil designs and occupies
the mountain for brigandage.

786
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,340
He not only persecutes the people,

787
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,980
but also wants to make you his wife by force.

788
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,300
You are dreaming.

789
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,420
I was inspired.

790
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,140
Meng Guo is a good name.

791
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,660
I suddenly recalled an allusion.

792
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,340
Have you ever heard...

793
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,460
Who?

794
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,940
Have, have you heard of

795
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,380
Zhuge Kongming?

796
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,420
Who is it?

797
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,380
A military counselor.

798
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,100
Shall I invite him here?

799
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,500
No need. I am capable enough.

800
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,780
Free him.

801
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,540
Why?

802
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,860
Why are you still in the mood
to ask about the reason?

803
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,060
Do you want to be beheaded?

804
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,980
Kill me if you want to.

805
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,900
Today I just brought a small troop

806
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,220
to gather military intelligence.

807
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,900
I find that your military camps a-a-re

808
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,180
neglectful of necessary precautions.

809
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,180
Thus, I launched a surprise attack.

810
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,820
It is really a pity.

811
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
You can behead me.

812
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,900
My men on Weimeng Mountain will revenge me.

813
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,780
Did, did you hear?

814
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,580
If we kill Meng Guo today,

815
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,860
the bandits will lose their leader.

816
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,460
It will be a serious problem in the future.

817
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,980
It will be harder for us to deal with them.

818
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,860
Based on the strength
of Young Master Han and Chuchu,

819
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,380
it must be easy to catch the bandits.

820
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,180
However, what matters now is

821
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,260
we have to make them stop

822
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,060
seizing others' possessions.

823
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,540
We should persuade them to work for us.

824
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,300
Free him.

825
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,740
Nothing matters as long as Qianqian is fine.

826
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,300
Hurry!

827
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,340
I know how to walk.

828
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,220
Get out of my way.

829
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,580
Are you sure it will work, Qianqian?

830
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,820
Yes.

831
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,940
Meng Guo is meant to be caught seven times.

832
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,220
Then he will be freed seven times.

833
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,820
After that, he will submit willingly.

834
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,460
Sorry.

835
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,220
I got you distracted.

836
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,020
I am to blame for this.

837
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,340
I haven't come back earlier.

838
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,180
Just now, you wanted to

839
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,300
block the sword attack for me.

840
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,460
I saw it clearly.

841
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,580
It doesn't matter.

842
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,740
From now on, in no case

843
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,660
can you do this again.

844
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,260
There is something else

845
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,700
to be clarified.

846
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,460
Last night, Young Master Han and I were out there.

847
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,940
Who exposed our campsite
and led Meng Guo here?

848
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,420
Cooked the congee?

849
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,060
Bring Su Ziying here!

850
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,180
I will punish him severely.
