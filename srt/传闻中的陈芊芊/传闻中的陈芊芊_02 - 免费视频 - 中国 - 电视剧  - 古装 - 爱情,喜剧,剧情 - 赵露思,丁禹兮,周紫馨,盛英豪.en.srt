23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 2)

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,340
(Many talents compete in splendor)

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,840
It's nothing serious. She just got drunk.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Drunk?

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,360
The Third Princess had never been intoxicated

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,110
no matter how much she drank.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,390
But one alcoholic drink
intoxicated her yesterday.

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,630
It couldn't have happened.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,710
Your Highness, you are awake.

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,760
Why is the dream still not over?

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,150
But... But...

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,280
Why is it still not over?

35
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,640
Did Han Shuo change the poisoned drink?

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
Actors nowadays

37
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,680
don't even consult the screenwriter

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,150
before revising the screenplay?

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,640
How can I go back now?

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,870
No. No.

41
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,000
Too much pain. Too much pain.

42
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,750
No. No.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,870
Too ugly. Too ugly.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,550
Xiaoqian,

45
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,640
everyone dies eventually.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,750
Death is not scary.

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,680
What's scary is

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,960
the filming will start soon
and you haven't submitted the screenplay.

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
It's so scary.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
What if dying in the dream

51
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,510
means dying from overwork in the real world?

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I'd like to thank Han Shuo

53
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,510
and the actors who improvised.

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,070
Thank them for giving a young screenwriter

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,480
the chance to learn about herself.

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,790
But how can I go back?

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
Huayuan City's Second Princess Chen Chuchu

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,870
has gone through hardships

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,350
and finally becomes the City Owner.

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,630
At Chen Chuchu's succession ceremony,

61
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,480
auspicious signs occur, the sun and the moon
shine at the same time,

62
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,680
heaven's door opens,

63
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,200
and the sky looks splendid.

64
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,760
Gosh.

65
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,790
If I have to finish this dream

66
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,040
in order to wake up,

67
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,760
which means I have to see auspicious signs
occur and heaven's door open,

68
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,350
then I must endure to the end of this drama.

69
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,240
Wait.

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,350
If Han Shuo doesn't help Chuchu,

71
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,430
she won't become the Crown Princess.

72
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,790
Han Shuo.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,400
Zi Rui.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,070
Where is Han Shuo?

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,560
He is in prison,

76
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,910
waiting to be executed today.

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
-Why? -Why?

78
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,430
Stop counting. Just tell me.

79
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,990
Her Majesty suspects that Young Master Han
has an ulterior motive for the marriage.

80
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,840
So, she plans to use last night's incident
as the excuse to...

81
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,710
Spare him, mother!

82
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,870
...remove the bad seed.

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,820
Your Highness.

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,140
(Prison)

85
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,960
Young Master, our people are waiting outside,

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,350
ready to rescue us.

87
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,430
As for the plan to seize the Dragon Bone...

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,240
Tell them

89
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,960
to light the beacon tonight.

90
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,200
The Xuanhu City Guards will march southward

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
and occupy Huayuan tomorrow.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Young Master, you should think twice.

93
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,480
The Dragon Bone...

94
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,630
Forget the Dragon Bone.

95
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,680
Before I could obtain the Dragon Bone,

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,510
Chen Qianqian could irritate me to death.

97
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,790
I can't wait to capture

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,630
Huayuan City's Chen and her daughter.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Chen Qianqian

100
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
will be put to death

101
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,030
after suffering from three thousand cuts.

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,510
Not one less cut.

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,280
Young Master, take it easy.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,310
As the saying goes,

105
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,310
"A little plan spoils..."

106
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,910
"A little impatience spoils great plans."

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,240
We can't give up the Dragon Bone

108
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,680
because of the Third Princess.

109
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,240
Your Majesty, the Third Princess is here
to pay you respect.

110
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,750
Pay me respect?

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,070
More like she is here for Han Shuo.

112
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,750
You are right.

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,790
The Third Princess...

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,310
Mother! Mother!

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,960
Mother! Mo...

116
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,350
Mother, please release Han Shuo.

117
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,630
Mother.

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,750
Your Highness.

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,910
Young Master Han attempted
to poison you on the wedding night.

120
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,070
He should be executed according to the law.

121
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,510
It wasn't Young Master Han's intention

122
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,680
to poison me.

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,440
I wronged him.

124
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,590
You had a high alcohol tolerance.

125
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,310
You had never been drunk.

126
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,790
How come one drink intoxicated you yesterday?

127
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,400
I...

128
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,790
When will Han Shuo be executed?

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,910
Three quarters past 11 o'clock.

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
What time is it now?

131
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,910
One quarter past 11 o'clock.

132
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,680
One quarter past 11 o'clock already?

133
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,280
This is a life-and-death matter.

134
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,120
It's one quarter past 11 o'clock

135
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,510
and you're asking me
about my alcohol tolerance.

136
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,070
You...

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
Enough!

138
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,840
Of course that is important.

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,510
You are my daughter, a noble lady.

140
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,960
You passing out from alcohol

141
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,280
or losing a wisp of hair

142
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,400
is an important matter,

143
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,590
not child's play.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,070
How fierce.

145
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,910
Qianqian,

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,910
the black stone mine

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,030
has brought wealth to Huayuan City.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
All this time,

149
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,510
Xuanhu City has regarded men as superior

150
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,030
and men as the people in charge.

151
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,160
It's been at daggers down with Huayuan City,

152
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,680
coveting our black stone mine.

153
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,000
Under these circumstances,

154
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,790
the obstinate owner of Xuanhu City

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,720
has proposed to marry his son off

156
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,190
into our family in Huayuan.

157
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,070
What do you think?

158
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
Does he mean to surrender

159
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
or does he harbor an ulterior motive?

160
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,030
Never mind.

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,630
I have told you this

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,510
for numerous times.

163
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,310
If you'd been able to understand,

164
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
you would have shared my worries.

165
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,160
Han Shuo was supposed to marry Chuchu.

166
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,160
I didn't know you would
snatch the groom in public.

167
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,750
I... I...

168
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,240
I know I've made a mistake.

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,590
I'm here to apologize.

170
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,120
Besides, he and I

171
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,880
haven't worshiped heaven,
gone on a parade and had a wedding.

172
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,680
You can consider us unmarried.

173
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,560
Let him marry Chuchu.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,790
But the whole city knows
you snatched the groom.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,790
Chuchu can't marry Han Shuo now.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
There will be opportunities
to foster the love

177
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,720
between my hero and heroine later on.

178
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,840
Han Shuo must not die.

179
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,070
I understand.

180
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,880
But he doesn't understand.

181
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
He?

182
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,510
Do you understand?

183
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,510
Your Majesty.

184
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,310
Should we find a doctor for her?

185
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,750
No need for a doctor.

186
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
No doctor knows this kind
of thing better than me.

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,310
Tell me. Whose baby is that?

188
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't know.

189
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,400
Consider it Han Shuo's baby.

190
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,280
Nonsense!

191
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,000
Han Shuo entered the city
the day before yesterday

192
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,440
and married you yesterday.

193
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,630
Today, you are...

194
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,160
You are pregnant.

195
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,400
No.

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
You useless wretch.

197
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,310
At the end of the day,

198
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,270
Huayuan City

199
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,760
doesn't restrain women like Xuanhu City,

200
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,080
but we still have ethics and rules.

201
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
As the daughter of Her Majesty,

202
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,000
you should at least have some manners.

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,030
Mother, it's two quarters past 11 o'clock.

204
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,000
Sangqi.

205
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,470
Go tell Han Shuo.

206
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,950
If he is willing to acknowledge
his relation with the baby,

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,150
I will pardon him.

208
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,270
Yes.

209
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,150
Go.

210
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,440
You.

211
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,270
Watch your mouth.

212
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,910
Before enough months pass,

213
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,590
you are not to reveal your pregnancy.

214
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,470
(Yueli Mansion)
Here is Her Majesty's decree.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,680
According to the benevolent City Owner,

216
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
after Young Master of Xuanhu, Han Shuo

217
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,390
got married,

218
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,950
he has been diligent, obedient,

219
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,320
and gentle,

220
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,910
and he has been of service by making a baby.

221
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,880
Therefore he is rewarded
with one jade scepter,

222
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,710
one peacock feather fan,

223
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
three pi of green mandarin duck silk,

224
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,590
one box of green tea,

225
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,680
one pair of glazed bottles...

226
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,910
Young Master.

227
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,120
How come all these things are green?

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,950
...and one gilded jadeite headdress.

229
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,880
Young Master.

230
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,000
Take it easy.

231
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,470
Young Master.

232
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,080
Young Master, you must be unaware

233
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,440
of a custom in Huayuan City.

234
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,560
Getting a green headdress from your elder

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,590
means your elder commends you

236
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,560
for being virtuous, amiable and generous.

237
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,390
Then

238
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,830
I should thank Her Highness

239
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
for giving me a green hat.
(It indicates he is a cuckold.)

240
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,200
Han Shuo, look on the bright side.

241
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,150
The baby is not yours,

242
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,950
but the woman is yours.

243
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,680
Well, I also heard

244
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,470
of a custom in Xuanhu City.

245
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,000
A man can marry many wives and concubines.

246
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,680
A man's wife

247
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,910
should treat his concubine's child

248
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,240
as her own and take care of the child.

249
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,150
It's the same in Huayuan

250
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,350
except a change of gender.

251
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,760
Do you have

252
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,910
any problems?

253
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Sangqi.

254
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,470
You can't talk sense into him.

255
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,590
Hey, the baby won't have your last name.

256
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,640
Why are you so unhappy?

257
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,590
Outrageous!

258
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,150
I can't believe children in Huayuan
don't have their father's last name.

259
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,270
Refreshing, isn't it?

260
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,560
Let me settle accounts with you.

261
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
Take me and your Young Master for example.

262
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
Whose house are you in?

263
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,830
The Third Princess's.

264
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,440
Who covers your daily expenses?

265
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,590
The Third Princess.

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,760
To whom do these servants belong?

267
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,560
The Third Princess.

268
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,240
Who will give birth

269
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,790
to the baby?

270
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,470
Still the Third Princess.

271
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,390
That settles it.

272
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,790
Your Young Master can't
even help deliver the baby.

273
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,150
Don't nitpick.

274
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,270
I...

275
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,520
By the way, Your Highness,

276
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,390
Her Majesty ordered me

277
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,640
to bring you this.

278
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
She said you loved eating this.

279
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,320
What is it?

280
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,680
Your Highness.

281
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,350
Young Master.

282
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,150
What shall we do now?

283
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
Since she insists

284
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,830
that I poisoned her,

285
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,760
I should do as she wishes.

286
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,680
Otherwise, my suffering would be for nothing.

287
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Tell our people

288
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,910
to take action as planned.

289
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,350
I want neither the bastard

290
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,390
nor the woman.

291
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes.

292
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,590
Young Master.

293
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,790
Arrangements have been made.

294
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,150
The glazed plate has been poisoned.

295
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,950
She'll take the poison at noon
and the poison will act at midnight.

296
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,350
No one will know.

297
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,640
There are many more delicious foods today.

298
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,950
Come on.

299
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,030
Hurry.

300
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,760
According to Huayuan City's rules,

301
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
when the Third Princess dines,

302
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,120
you must stay to serve her

303
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,240
and distribute the foods for her.

304
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,120
Sure.

305
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,030
Young Master, the glazed plate
has been poisoned.

306
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,350
Yong Master, the glazed plate.

307
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,760
Yum. Yum.

308
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Serve all the foods!

309
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,200
(Two hours ago)
Your Highness.

310
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
(Two hours ago)

311
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,320
(Two hours ago)
Your Highness.

312
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,760
The kitchen staff asked
what you would like to eat today.

313
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,390
What would I like to eat today?

314
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,260
(Cold dishes)

315
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,240
I want everything on this menu.

316
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,200
Everything on this menu?

317
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,710
And I want the best tableware.

318
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,910
Yes.

319
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,760
All the plates will be replaced
by glazed plates.

320
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,150
What is a glazed plate?

321
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,320
A plate that has been glazed.

322
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,520
Did Han Shuo poison the dishes?

323
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,120
Han Shuo, you disappoint me.

324
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,880
I took pains to rescue you from prison.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,320
And you repay my kindness with enmity.

326
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,910
Han Shuo, you have toiled for the whole day.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You should sit down

328
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
and dine with me.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,680
No.

330
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,270
According to Huayuan City's rules,

331
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,590
men must not dine at the table.

332
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,270
You should...

333
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,440
Xuanhu City has a saying,

334
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,440
"Follow whoever you marry."

335
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Now that we are married,

336
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,390
you should follow me.

337
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,200
Han Shuo, enjoy.

338
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,830
You need to eat for two now.

339
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,030
You should have all the foods.

340
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,390
But the guest should suit
the convenience of the host.

341
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,950
I'm asking you to eat. You must eat.

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,710
Open your mouth.

343
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,950
No. No.

344
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,030
Living in harmony
and showing respect to each other.

345
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,000
What a loving couple.

346
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,920
Nonsense.

347
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,520
Not in harmony.

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,310
Don't stand there.

349
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,430
Prepare another meal.

350
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,310
No need.

351
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
I'm done eating.

352
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,800
I can't eat like this.

353
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,070
Where are you going?

354
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,640
The City Owner's mansion.

355
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,520
For what?

356
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,120
Food.

357
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm going with you.

358
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,040
The glazed plate.

359
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,760
Young Master.

360
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,160
Bai Ji,

361
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,470
you know what would happen
to those who betrayed me.

362
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,520
Young Master, spare me.

363
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,830
I dare not betray you.

364
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,640
I've always been faithful to you.

365
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,280
I mean "loyal to you".

366
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,830
I've planned it all out.

367
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,670
And I've poisoned a glazed plate.

368
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,160
I didn't expect the Third Princess

369
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,800
to replace all the plates
with glazed plates on a whim.

370
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,920
It was similar to the time

371
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,120
when she rode a horse

372
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
on the streets on a whim,

373
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,640
which sabotaged our plan.

374
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,070
Things are changeable.

375
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,830
I can't control them.

376
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,670
Please give the people who have erred,

377
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,190
especially me,

378
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,800
a chance to make amends.

379
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,120
It's not easy to eat to satiety.

380
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,670
Stop eating if you are full.

381
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,240
Medical books say,

382
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,160
"The eggplant is sweet, cold and smooth.

383
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,160
It'll harm pregnant women."

384
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
You can't eat it.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Yes.

386
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,430
I'll have a crab then.

387
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
The crab is cold.

388
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,120
It can promote blood circulation
and remove blood stasis.

389
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,400
You can't eat it.

390
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
You are right.

391
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,430
Spicy chicken.

392
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
I can eat spicy chicken.

393
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,640
Pregnant women can't eat spicy food.

394
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
Who put it on the table?

395
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,280
Take it away. Hurry.

396
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,670
My crab.

397
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,070
Wait. My spicy chicken.

398
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,640
Your Highness.

399
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,280
You... You...

400
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,640
What's wrong with my hand?

401
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,040
Your... Your...

402
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,400
Your gecko cinnabar is still intact.

403
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,310
Gecko cinnabar?

404
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,310
No way.

405
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,040
Chen Qianqian is lustful.

406
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,950
How can her gecko cinnabar be intact?

407
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,830
I have to get the logic
of the screenplay straight.

408
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,590
Maybe Chen Qianqian is the type of girl
who smokes, drinks and whores,

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,470
but has a kind heart?

410
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,550
What a pleasant surprise.

411
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,190
I'd like to know how you got pregnant.

412
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,520
The gecko cinnabar is intact.

413
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,240
So I'm not pregnant.

414
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,040
Your Highness, you... you...

415
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,190
For a prisoner,

416
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,670
you lied about something
as important as reproduction.

417
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,670
You have failed

418
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,120
to meet my expectations of you.

419
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,470
You have off-key behaviors.

420
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,430
You have disgraced us nobles.

421
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,040
Outrageous.

422
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,520
Truly outrageous.

423
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,120
Where is Han Shuo? Han Shuo!

424
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,430
No, mother. Mother.

425
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,590
Calm down.

426
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,800
Don't blame Han Shuo, mother.

427
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,310
Explain the situation, Your Highness.

428
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,040
What exactly is going on?

429
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,710
I love Han Shuo.

430
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,280
I fell in love with him at first sight.

431
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,070
And my love for him is deep.

432
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,880
I can't live without Han Shuo.

433
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,190
I really love him.

434
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,190
Please let us be together.

435
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,710
Fine.

436
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,880
If you were sensible,

437
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,550
you wouldn't be Chen Qianqian.

438
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,260
But

439
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,590
you'd better get your man under control.

440
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,240
As long as he doesn't make trouble,

441
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,710
I'll spare him.

442
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,950
Otherwise, I'll punish you along with him.

443
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm full.

444
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,240
I need to go back.

445
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
I'll go back.

446
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,000
Go.

447
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,830
Take all these things away.

448
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,550
Your Majesty.

449
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,670
Don't be too sad.

450
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,710
These things

451
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
will be of use sooner or later.

452
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,710
I hope so.

453
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,470
Yes.

454
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,350
I'm in a difficult situation.

455
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,950
People say it's dangerous
to keep a ruler company.

456
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm around a male ruler and a female ruler.

457
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,950
I can live with the owner of Huayuan City.

458
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,640
But what about Han Shuo?

459
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,670
He is like a time bomb.

460
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,520
No.

461
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,590
I must push him to Chen Chuchu.

462
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,590
When the story ends,

463
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,400
I'll be able to go home.

464
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
But the plot is stuck right now.

465
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,830
Zi Rui,

466
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,280
what is a person who writes screenplays

467
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,670
called in this era?

468
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,470
What is a screenplay?

469
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,350
It's a story.

470
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,800
A storyteller?

471
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,350
Yes. That's it.

472
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,470
How do I call a storyteller?

473
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,590
Storytelling, variety drama and lyrics

474
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,590
are all...

475
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,280
They are all written by storytellers?

476
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,470
Brilliant.

477
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
When I think about it,

478
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,520
seeing what era this is,

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,190
they are my predecessors.

480
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,590
Your Highness, do you want to hear stories?

481
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,670
No.

482
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,830
I want to have a few aides.

483
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,780
(Qingfeng Tea House)

484
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,280
Your Highness.

485
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,310
Storytellers.

486
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,710
The three of them are
the best in Huayuan City.

487
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,430
I pay respect to you, Your Highness.

488
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,550
Where do you work?

489
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,000
I tell stories in a tea house.

490
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,350
I perform shadow plays under a bridge.

491
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,000
I have my own theater.

492
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,400
Good.

493
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,880
They are divided into several classes.

494
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,160
It's basically the same as our era.

495
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,830
Take a seat.

496
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,280
I invited you here

497
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,000
because I just

498
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,000
couldn't figure out something.

499
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,190
I hope you'll enlighten me.

500
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,280
Do tell us.

501
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,430
I wrote a story.

502
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,430
The hero...

503
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,800
The hero

504
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,760
is this banana.

505
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,400
The heroine

506
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,590
is this apple.

507
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,000
The female supporting role

508
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,520
is this orange.

509
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,670
The original plot is like this.

510
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,920
The orange snatches the banana
who is getting married.

511
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
But on the wedding night,

512
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,550
the banana murders the orange with poison.

513
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,310
Then the banana and the apple...

514
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,120
The two fruits...

515
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,070
No.

516
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,400
The two people

517
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,520
go through

518
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,880
love and hatred.

519
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,000
In the end, they become together.

520
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,120
A regular work.

521
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,350
Nothing interesting.

522
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,830
It follows a pattern.

523
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,920
That's right.

524
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,550
But the story is different now.

525
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,830
The orange

526
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,000
doesn't die on the wedding night.

527
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,350
It survives.

528
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,710
A plot twist.

529
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,800
Break the mold.

530
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,240
It can be a surprise.

531
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm good at comedy.

532
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,670
And it's a trick I often use.

533
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,520
I don't want any plot twist.

534
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,430
I don't want any surprise.

535
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,590
I just want to create a regular work

536
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,830
and match up the apple and the banana.

537
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,800
Then the orange is an obstacle.

538
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,550
I suggest that you

539
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,070
untangle the situation,

540
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,040
and make the complicated plot

541
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,640
simple.

542
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,880
That's so violent.

543
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,400
This is a living being, after all.

544
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,470
Don't do that.

545
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,520
Your Highness,

546
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,190
we storytellers

547
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,000
have three techniques.

548
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,350
The plot rhythm must be steady.

549
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,350
The dramatic conflict must be on point.

550
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,070
Be ruthless to redundant subplots.

551
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,800
This orange is obviously redundant.

552
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,950
It has to be removed.

553
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,240
No need to remove it.

554
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,070
I'm good at tragedy.

555
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,710
Life and death

556
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
entangled with love and hatred

557
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,190
makes a story interesting.

558
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
No.

559
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
That's too simple and crude.

560
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,240
You can find

561
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,190
a technical means

562
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,240
to make a detour.

563
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,240
Am I right?

564
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,950
What's your idea?

565
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,070
Tell me.

566
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,240
I'd like to put on a show

567
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,590
and make the banana

568
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,190
save the apple

569
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,120
or make the apple save the banana.

570
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,280
What do you think?

571
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,670
How are you going

572
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,710
to put on this show?

573
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,710
Are you sure Chuchu will pass
by the Music and Dance Academy?

574
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,430
She definitely will.

575
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,760
The Third Lady is here.

576
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,550
She is a princess, not a lady.

577
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,880
You have grown so tall.

578
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,640
Looking at you makes my neck hurt.

579
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,590
You are so thin.

580
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,400
Please ingest more food.

581
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,520
You look like a bamboo pole.

582
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,950
Your Highness.

583
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,800
Only your employer,

584
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,160
the brat Lin Qi,

585
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,120
fancies men of your kind.

586
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Lin Qi! Lin Qi!

587
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,190
Young Master.

588
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,240
I'd like to see

589
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,040
what her plan is.

590
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,880
Come on.

591
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,800
Chen Qianqian, don't you dare go that far.

592
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,880
As the richest family in Huayuan City,

593
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,070
my family has served Her Majesty
and made provisions from generation to generation.

594
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,350
Even the Second Princess respects me.

595
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
Don't assume you can make trouble here

596
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,920
just because you are
Her Majesty's daughter.

597
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,830
What,

598
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,280
your men aren't talented enough
and you forbid me to criticize them?

599
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,310
My men aren't talented enough?

600
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,710
Have you

601
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,240
found a more talented man

602
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,310
to compete with me?

603
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,640
Sure.

604
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,000
Everyone knows I have married

605
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,590
the Young Master of Xuanhu lately.

606
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,040
What do you mean?

607
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,040
Let's have a competition.

608
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,240
We'll see who the most talented man

609
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,920
in Huayuan City is.

610
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,550
Fine.

611
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,240
Who is your contestant?

612
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,190
Han Shuo is.

613
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,760
Go find Su Mu.

614
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Yes.

615
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,470
Gosh.

616
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,000
The Third Princess is using
Young Master Han as a wager.

617
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,700
She is betting on him.

618
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,830
-Han Shuo. -Han Shuo.

619
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,900
(The Music and Dance Academy)

620
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,040
So many people have deserted
the streets to see Su Mu here.

621
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,040
The Young Master of Xuanhu
is going to lose the competition.

622
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,310
In Huayuan City,

623
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,070
women make decisions about their households.

624
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,520
If you dare to defy me,

625
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,280
I'll divorce you

626
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,430
and drive you back to Xuanhu City.

627
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,640
You'll never be able
to enter Huayuan City again.

628
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,280
Han Shuo, you'd better think it over.

629
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,880
Young Master.

630
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,000
The Dragon Bone.

631
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,040
A little impatience spoils great plans.

632
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,310
Chen Qianqian,

633
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,070
you are pushing me.

634
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,830
the Crown Princess of the owner of Xuanhu City

635
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,950
can't even defeat a musician?

636
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,670
You...

637
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,000
Our Young Master is mighty and masculine.

638
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,070
He is unmatched in this world.

639
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,160
That's great.

640
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,590
Let's welcome Su Mu.

641
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,670
Alright. Alright. No crowd.

642
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,040
Calm down.

643
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,760
No crowd.

644
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,800
Look at me.

645
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,240
Do you see that?

646
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,280
He's going to the Third Princess again.

647
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,520
Only the Third Princess can draw him out.

648
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
Your Highness, we haven't seen
each other in a long time.

649
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,830
How come you are here

650
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,070
soon after getting married?

651
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,280
Is it because the men of Xuanhu

652
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,160
have no grasp of music theories?

653
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,950
Your Highness.

654
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,190
When you are free,

655
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,240
come to the Music and Dance Academy
and enjoy music.

656
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,190
Alright?

657
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,590
So good-looking.

658
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,190
Why is Chuchu still not here?

659
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I don't know.

660
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,070
It's so pleasing to the ear.

661
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,880
So euphonious.

662
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,350
All the men of Huayuan City

663
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,830
can play musical instruments and sing songs.

664
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,670
Yeah.

665
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,400
What can the men of Xuanhu City do?

666
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,640
They can't do anything.

667
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,430
Fight.

668
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,670
Fight.

669
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,500
So handsome.

670
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,160
Young Master Han is pretty nice.

671
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Good-looking. So good-looking.

672
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,590
What a shame.

673
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,920
He has a heart disease

674
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,000
that attacks from time to time.

675
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
I think the Third Princess

676
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,830
is making things difficult
for him on purpose.

677
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,040
It looks like a goddess
is scattering flowers.

678
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,190
Young Master Han is amazing.

679
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,950
Where is Chuchu?

680
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,240
I've put on such a show

681
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,880
for her.

682
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,190
Why is she still not here?

683
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,190
If she doesn't show up
to defend Han Shuo now,

684
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,350
I might irritate

685
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,550
this demon king to death.

686
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
Watch out!

687
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,430
How dare you!

688
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,120
You aimed your sword at Qianqian.

689
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,070
No, Chuchu. Chuchu.

690
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,190
Chuchu, you got it wrong.

691
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,590
I forced him to do this.

692
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,240
Chuchu.

693
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,670
You... You are supposed to help him.

694
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,470
You are supposed to scold me

695
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,800
and reprimand me.

696
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,070
You are supposed to be
the beauty who saves the hero.

697
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,190
How can you two fight?

698
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,590
Young Master! That's the Second Princess!

699
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,760
I've been told the Second Princess
is talented and charming.

700
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,310
Now I finally see you.

701
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,040
I'm honored.

702
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,590
Han Shuo, please behave yourself.

703
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,640
What are you guys doing?

704
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,120
Chuchu,

705
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,760
the Young Master of Xuanhu City

706
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,550
was forced by me to compete with a musician.

707
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,550
I'm so mean, right?

708
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,470
Do you feel like scolding me?

709
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,590
Do you feel like whipping me?

710
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,000
It's one thing to take your
newly wedded husband

711
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,310
to the Music and Dance Academy,

712
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,400
and it's another thing to make
him compete with a musician.

713
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,760
Scold me.

714
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,920
Then take him to your mansion,
so he can recover there.

715
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,190
So, you disrespected her

716
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,470
and attempted to assassinate her.

717
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,000
It seems you men of Xuanhu
have no idea of virtues

718
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,190
and need education.

719
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,240
Guards.

720
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,760
Yes.

721
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,000
Capture him.

722
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,950
Yes.

723
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,040
No. No.

724
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,300
Chuchu, he is Han Shuo. You...

725
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,640
Just a hostage sent from Xuanhu City

726
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,400
to our city for marriage.

727
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,470
I see no reason to stand by.

728
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,630
I've been giving you everything

729
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,710
you want since childhood.

730
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,000
No matter how stubborn Han Shuo is,

731
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,390
I'll tame him for you.

732
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,280
Thank you, I guess.

733
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,240
Your Highness, you might
as well do it yourself.

734
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,320
No. No. No.

735
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,240
This is messed up.

736
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,470
The plot isn't developing
in the right direction.

737
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,470
My hero and heroine

738
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,000
are supposed to fall in love at first sight.

739
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,760
But they are fighting now.

740
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,910
Stop!

741
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
His clothing has been torn.

742
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,470
Where are his manners as the Crown Princess?

743
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,280
It's out of control.

744
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,910
Can somebody save me from this situation?

745
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,800
Stop.

746
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,360
-Minister Pei. -Minister Pei.

747
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,670
Minister Pei is so handsome.

748
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,950
Forget him.

749
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,000
The Third Princess has been
engaged to him since childhood.

750
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
Hasn't she married Young Master Han?

751
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,560
Young Master Han has a heart disease.

752
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,760
He can't live for long.

753
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,360
Outrageous.

754
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,320
He is the Crown Princess of a City Owner.

755
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,710
How can we slight him like this?

756
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,080
Finally, someone said the right line.

757
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,080
Pei Heng.

758
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,800
This is my favorite role.

759
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,080
How can we

760
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,470
tear Young Master Han's clothing in public?

761
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,430
Yes. Yes. Yes.

762
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,600
I bullied him and forgot...

763
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,190
Forgot about etiquette and rules.

764
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
I was being unruly and willful.

765
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,320
Let's call it a day.

766
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,670
Go home, people.

767
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,870
Go home.

768
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,600
Look. The Third Princess really
listens to Minister Pei.

769
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,280
Her new love and old love.

770
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,630
And there is Su Mu.

771
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's go.

772
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,710
Minister Pei, look at her.

773
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,430
Right after marrying Young Master Han,

774
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,870
she took him to the Music
and Dance Academy for a competition.

775
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,040
How inappropriate.

776
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
It's all her idea.

777
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,110
Don't blame me.

778
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,280
It's your idea?

779
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,150
Yes, my idea.

780
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,760
Han Shuo, don't blame Chuchu.

781
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,760
Chuchu, don't blame Han Shuo.

782
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,870
Your Highness,

783
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
come with me.

784
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,950
I need to talk to you.

785
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,760
Deploy the archers.

786
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,360
If Chen Qianqian doesn't

787
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,150
die of arrow wounds tonight,

788
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,870
I will take your life.

789
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,470
Yes.

790
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,080
I didn't like you

791
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,800
because you were unruly and willful

792
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,040
and you acted recklessly.

793
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,470
Since you ignored our engagement

794
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,320
and took the Young Master of Xuanhu
to your mansion by force,

795
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,320
you should treat him well.

796
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,670
I can't believe you are so stupid

797
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,360
and have no regard
for other people's feelings.

798
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,670
It's not like that.

799
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,630
Young Master Han has married
into your family in Huayuan City.

800
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,280
He is all alone and helpless.

801
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,910
He has no family and friend.

802
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,600
His parents are not with him.

803
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,950
He doesn't even have anyone to talk to.

804
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,910
He must be treading on thin ice
and every step he takes could lead to danger.

805
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,870
You are

806
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,600
too willful.

807
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,600
I'll ask Her Majesty

808
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,870
to cancel our engagement tomorrow.

809
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,760
You and Young Master Han...

810
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,360
Why are you crying?

811
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm also alone and helpless.

812
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,080
I have no friend and family.

813
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,670
My parents aren't with me.

814
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,840
I don't even have anyone to talk to.

815
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm also treading on thin ice
and every step I take could lead to danger.

816
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,470
I just want to go home.

817
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,080
It's why I made this unwise decision.

818
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,670
Pei Heng, stop scolding me.

819
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
I like you very much.

820
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,600
What... what did you say?

821
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,760
I mean

822
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,430
that I didn't intend to humiliate Han Shuo.

823
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,600
You compared him with a musician
at the Music and Dance Academy.

824
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,040
You don't think that's humiliation?

825
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,950
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,760
You're... sorry?

827
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I know.

828
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,760
I made a mistake.

829
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,000
You... You are really apologizing?
