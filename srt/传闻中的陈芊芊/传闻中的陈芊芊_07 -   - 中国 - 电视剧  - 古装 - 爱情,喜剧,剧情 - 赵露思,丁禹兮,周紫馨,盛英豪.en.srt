23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 7)

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,580
Young Master Han is loaded.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,740
We have profited.

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,940
He's the hero.

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,220
Of course he should be rich.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,380
But it's only the tip of the iceberg.

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,980
There is more to come.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,060
What I mean is

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,020
Han Shuo is being gentle

32
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,620
like a kitty.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,060
A kitty wouldn't want to eat the orange.

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,500
Your Highness, you're really resourceful.

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,260
This way,

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,460
Young Master Han will be devoted to you.

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,020
Zi Rui, let's enjoy opera songs
at the tea house.

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,700
Your Highness, Young Master Han said,

39
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,860
"If the Third Princess wants
to listen to opera songs,

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,460
invite the opera singers here
from the theater."

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,220
Invite them here?

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,300
"If the Third Princess wants to eat dessert,

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,500
ask a restaurant to make dessert
and send it here."

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,140
Send it here?

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,260
"If the Third Princess wants
to stroll on the streets,

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,300
bring all the jugglers and stands in the city

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,540
to the mansion."

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,220
In summary,

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,460
stop the Third Princess from leaving the mansion.

50
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,380
Stop me from leaving the mansion?

51
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,300
He wants to confine me to the mansion.

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,020
Young Master Han is
supporting the family, after all.

53
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,380
It won't do.

54
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,260
Even my mother wouldn't
confine me to the mansion

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,180
and stop me from going out.

56
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,300
Han Shuo wants to confine me?

57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,460
Not gonna happen.

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,060
He wants to trap me.

59
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,820
Try it.

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,500
Your Highness, something seems wrong.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,980
It's her. It's her.

62
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,420
Do you sense a surge of hostility?

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,100
Now I know why Han Shuo

64
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,180
has been keeping me from leaving the mansion.

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,740
It's her, Chen Qianqian.

66
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,660
She destroyed our Dragon Bone.

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,500
Feudalistic superstition can cause
great harm. Zi Rui.

68
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,620
She destroyed our Dragon Bone.

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,940
Hit her! Hit her!

70
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,020
Run. Run.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,260
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

72
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,900
The revised paragraph

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,740
is a stroke of genius.

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,940
A desperate situation turned around.

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,900
I truly feel humbled.

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,980
The orange's friendly gesture
is precious and touching.

77
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,060
The banana should be too ashamed

78
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,980
to ever attempt to harm the orange again.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,380
Moreover,

80
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,900
the orange stepped out of the fight
for succeeding the City Owner,

81
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,260
which gave way to the apple.

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,580
It's killing three birds with one stone.

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,780
No one died.

84
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,860
All problems have been solved.

85
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,260
Brilliant. Brilliant.

86
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,660
Don't you think

87
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,100
the orange is living

88
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
in a hostile environment?

89
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,740
Your Highness,

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,180
Great people

91
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,380
are always starved,

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,780
poverty-stricken and exhausted

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,220
before finding happiness.

94
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah.

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,540
Besides, seeing how smart you are,

96
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,420
the orange won't be stuck

97
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,060
in the difficult situation

98
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
for too long.

99
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,300
But the orange laid its hands

100
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,900
on the city's treasure.

101
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,380
Now the people are indignant.

102
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,660
I'm afraid the tension
won't ease in a short time.

103
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,420
Can you please offer me some suggestions

104
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,700
so I can improve the situation a little?

105
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,860
Unless

106
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,460
another treasure appears,

107
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,420
otherwise...

108
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,340
The idea of another treasure sounds good.

109
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,140
How often does a treasure appear?

110
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,300
Where can I find a treasure?

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,660
It won't take long.

112
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,820
Just wait for over a thousand years.

113
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,980
Leave everything

114
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,780
to time.

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,900
This is my home.

116
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,660
No matter what happens,
I should be allowed to go home.

117
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,420
They think I can't do anything?

118
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,740
Even a clay doll can have a fit.

119
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,740
Just because I'm not the Third Princess,

120
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,220
they think they can pick on me at will?

121
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,060
Chen Qianqian!

122
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,780
You jerk! Pig's ear!

123
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,980
How dare you steal the Dragon Bone
and bring bad luck to the city?

124
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,620
What made you so bold?

125
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,740
You had indulged in dissipation
and you had been tyrannical.

126
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,380
How dare you bring disaster to the people?

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,780
Aren't you afraid of punishment from heaven?

128
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,580
Who is she?

129
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,220
You... You... I'm going to drag you out here

130
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,740
and beat you up.

131
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,260
I'll beat you up.

132
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,260
Don't look at me. I'm shy. Don't look at me.

133
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,780
I'll beat you up!

134
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,220
I'll beat you up!

135
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,460
She is Chen Qianqian!

136
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,860
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

137
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,940
They blame me.

138
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,220
People block the door of Yueli Mansion.

139
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,820
They attack the Third Princess
whenever they see her.

140
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,700
In the end, the Third Princess went back home

141
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,980
by pretending to be a passerby

142
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,900
who scolded herself.

143
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,540
She deserved it.

144
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,140
She had the nerve

145
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,700
to destroy the Dragon Bone for her own use.

146
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,300
She acted against the people's will.
She's definitely going to be punished.

147
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,100
Bad news. Bad news.

148
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,980
My lady,

149
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,100
the Dragon Bone has shown its presence
and imposed punishment.

150
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,980
Really? What happened to Chen Qianqian?

151
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,100
Lightning suddenly struck.

152
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,900
Our mine has exploded.

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,900
What?!

154
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,380
Our mine has exploded.

155
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,220
Whose mine has exploded?

156
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
Ours.

157
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,980
Our what has exploded?

158
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,980
Mine.

159
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,820
Say it again.

160
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,740
What happened to our mine?

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,100
It has exploded, my lady.

162
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,580
Lightning has caused our mine to explode.

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Explode. Explode. Explode.

164
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,220
Our mine has exploded?

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,740
My lady, please make a decision right now.

166
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,820
Chen Qianqian,

167
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,380
you jinx!

168
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,900
Heaven meant to punish you,

169
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,580
but lightning struck the wrong person's asset.

170
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,500
She has got her share of bad luck.

171
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,620
She always paraded her mine.

172
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,900
Lightning struck it.

173
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,620
Just because she was Huayuan City's moneybag,

174
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,020
she tended to pick on you,

175
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
she tended to abuse her power.

176
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,460
Now I'd like to see her act tough.

177
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,980
I'm here waiting for her.

178
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,460
She likes to pick on me, doesn't she?

179
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,940
Fine. Feel free to come at me.

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Your Highness.

181
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,540
Your Highness, I have bad news.

182
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,060
More and more people
have come to block the door.

183
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,580
They are going to barge into this place.

184
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,020
Investigation shows the mine disaster
wasn't caused by humans.

185
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,540
We should appease the families

186
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,460
of the trapped miner properly.

187
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,460
By the way,

188
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,940
how is the rescue operation going?

189
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,660
The only escape for the trapped miners

190
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,940
has been blocked by stones.

191
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,500
According to informed citizens,

192
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,660
over 100 miners

193
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,940
are trapped under the rear hill,

194
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,660
not far from the earth's surface.

195
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,500
If we use explosives to blast the rock,

196
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,020
we should be able to rescue the miners

197
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,020
before the mine completely collapses.

198
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,020
How many miners have been rescued?

199
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,860
We...

200
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,380
We haven't started the rescue operation yet.

201
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,180
Outrageous.

202
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,620
We are talking about over 100 lives.

203
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,660
Are you expecting me to rescue them personally?

204
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,540
Your Majesty, please calm down.

205
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,980
It's not our intention to delay rescuing them.

206
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,020
However...

207
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,100
However, the mine's rear hill

208
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,260
is connected to Huayuan's fortune lode.

209
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
If we use explosives,

210
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,180
the fortune lode will be affected.

211
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,700
We can't commit

212
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,780
such a sin, Your Majesty.

213
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,180
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

214
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,420
Huayuan has just lost the Dragon Bone.

215
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,340
It must not lose the fortune lode.

216
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,460
A petition?

217
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,860
Your Majesty,

218
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,020
it's a petition submitted
jointly by the citizens.

219
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,540
Ten thousand citizens have petitioned for...

220
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,660
Petitioned for what?

221
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,220
Petitioned for...

222
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,740
They have petitioned for Chen Qianqian's death
to quell heaven's wrath.

223
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,340
How dare you!

224
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,380
Please sentence Chen Qianqian to death
in order to quell heaven's wrath.

225
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,780
Your Highness.

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,100
Your Highness, please take pity on us.

227
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,540
Save my son.

228
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
And my family.

229
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,940
All of them are buried in the mine.

230
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,380
I don't know if they are alive or dead.

231
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,100
Over 100 lives

232
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,620
depend on you.

233
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,300
They depend on you.

234
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,620
Is there anything I can do?

235
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,140
Your Highness, I'm begging you,

236
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,220
please sacrifice yourself.

237
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,580
Offer yourself as a sacrifice
to quell heaven's wrath.

238
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,820
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

239
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,100
Please sacrifice yourself, Your Highness.

240
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,740
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

241
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Please embrace death bravely, Your Highness.

242
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,420
Please sacrifice yourself, Your Highness.

243
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,140
Chen Qianqian calls herself the "Third Princess"

244
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,460
for fun.

245
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,580
But I'm the person to take the blame.

246
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,700
I'll pay a heavy price for this.

247
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:54,780
Please sentence Chen Qianqian to death
in order to quell heaven's wrath.

248
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,100
You...

249
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,500
You are asking me to kill my child,

250
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,500
aren't you?

251
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,580
Now people are indignant.

252
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,780
We must kill her
to assuage people's indignation.

253
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,060
Instead of trying to convict Chen Qianqian,

254
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,180
we should find a way

255
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,580
to protect the fortune lode

256
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,020
and save lives.

257
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,820
Have you got any ideas, Minister Yang?

258
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,460
We can put the rescue operation on hold

259
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
until the mine collapses.

260
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,620
Then we can declare
the rescue team arrive too late,

261
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
and pretend to scold the official

262
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,500
in charge of the rescue operation.

263
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,260
As for the families of the victims,

264
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,980
the government can appease them

265
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,740
with more financial compensation.

266
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,740
What about Yueli Mansion?

267
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,340
I heard people

268
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,660
have surrounded Yueli Mansion.

269
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,940
Chen Qianqian can neither enter
nor leave the mansion.

270
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,220
She's in peril.

271
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
This matter

272
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,420
requires your decision to settle.

273
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,140
Please give your order, mother.

274
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,220
What order?

275
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,900
The commoner Chen Qianqian laid her hands on the Dragon Bone

276
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,980
which incurred heaven's punishment.

277
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,740
People have been punished for her crime.
She must not be pardoned.

278
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,660
I'd take troops to surround Yueli Mansion

279
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,220
and guard her well.

280
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,260
After the storm calms down,

281
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,100
she will be dealt with according to her crime.

282
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,540
Approved.

283
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,500
You shall take troops there immediately.

284
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,660
Guard her well.

285
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,340
Don't let that bastard run away.

286
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,540
Alright. You're dismissed.

287
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,140
Mother.

288
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,900
I'll keep Qianqian safe.

289
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,940
Chuchu.

290
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,580
Qianqian has always been obedient to you.

291
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,060
Be on your way

292
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,500
and don't let her run away.

293
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,540
You must guard her well.

294
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,980
With you watching over her,

295
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,980
I'll feel relieved.

296
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,340
Yes.

297
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,380
Chuchu.

298
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,100
Whatever happens in the future,

299
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,980
you must keep Qianqian safe.

300
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,780
I won't fail you, mother.

301
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,540
Your Majesty, it seems

302
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,020
you have high hopes for the Second Princess.

303
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,580
Qianqian is hopeless.

304
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,420
I'm taking the overall situation into account,

305
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,780
leaving the important task to Chuchu.

306
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,380
I hope she'll achieve greatness

307
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,700
and treat Qianqian nicely.

308
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,940
Qianqian,

309
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,580
you and I are the children of City Owners.

310
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,140
We seem to be in a high position,

311
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,020
but we often have no choice.

312
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,620
Don't take their words to heart.

313
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,020
Just stay here.

314
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,180
While I'm here,

315
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,020
nobody will dare to harm you.

316
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,540
Bai Ji.

317
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,780
Tell our people to be on standby.

318
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,060
Yes.

319
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,340
I know I won't die.

320
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
But what about the miners in the mine?

321
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,220
You're still thinking for them?

322
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,780
Don't forget

323
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,940
that Huayuan's citizens

324
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
just petitioned for your sacrifice.

325
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,420
I'm Her Majesty's daughter.

326
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,580
I enjoyed wealth in peaceful times.

327
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,580
I didn't do much to benefit the people.

328
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,700
All I did was make trouble.

329
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,980
It's normal

330
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,620
for them to blame me

331
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,820
when a disaster occurs.

332
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,780
Mountains decide the scale of population
and water decides the degree of prosperity.

333
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,500
This place nestles against mountains and water.

334
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,900
It's a treasured land with great feng shui.

335
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,660
The so-called fortune lode was created

336
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,860
when your ancestors settled down in this place.

337
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Their descendants built a city

338
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,060
around this place.

339
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,220
Then Huayuan City gradually took form.

340
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,220
This place has been honored as the fortune lode.

341
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,380
It's the foundation of Huayuan City.

342
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,980
The fortune lode is very close to the mine,

343
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,460
because Huayuan City's economic lifeline

344
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,020
lies in the mining industry.

345
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,740
Your ancestors were really far-sighted.

346
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,380
They built the city here

347
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,700
to guarantee provisions for the citizens.

348
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,100
My ancestors planned carefully,

349
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,020
but they didn't know they would
have an unworthy descendant like me.

350
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,420
This place is connected to the mine.

351
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,100
The drawing tells me

352
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,860
those miners are trapped

353
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,540
here.

354
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,660
Before entering the cave and starting to mine,

355
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,380
the miners would use pillars
to secure the rocks in the cave,

356
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,300
preventing the mine from collapsing.

357
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
From we are seeing now,

358
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,700
only half of the mountain has collapsed,

359
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,460
which means half of the wooden pillars

360
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,100
are still supporting the cave.

361
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,420
It's very likely that those people in the mine

362
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,340
will come out alive.

363
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,700
The pillars in the mine

364
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
might not hold for long.

365
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,220
Then what are we waiting for?
Go and rescue them now.

366
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,740
Couldn't my mother and the others
find a way out of this?

367
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,340
I have an idea.

368
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,020
The fortune lode in the rear can be...

369
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,860
Exploded.

370
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,700
Right.

371
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,140
You think so too?

372
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,300
Yes.

373
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,500
This way, we can open up a path

374
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,980
for them to escape.

375
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,180
What's on your mind?

376
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,660
I'm wondering

377
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,540
who would commit the monstrous crime

378
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,500
of blowing up the fortune lode.

379
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,420
After I stewed the Dragon Bone,

380
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,060
a bunch of people begged me to die.

381
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,180
Blowing up the fortune lode is also a grave crime
that will result in capital punishment.

382
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,180
I know.

383
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,340
Only one person can do this.

384
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,340
The heroine.

385
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,900
The heroine can do this for sure.

386
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:04,940
Qianqian.

387
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Make way.

388
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,140
Couldn't she see that I want to help her?

389
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,340
Young Master, you don't have to help her.

390
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,980
It's unlikely for the miners to return alive.

391
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,180
The people will blame Her Majesty
for her incompetence.

392
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,580
The more turbulent Huayuan City is,

393
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,540
the more advantages Xuanhu City has.

394
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,820
If you solve the problem,

395
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,020
you will fall into an awkward situation.

396
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm afraid that the people

397
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,340
will blame Qianqian for this.

398
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,220
But whatever.

399
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,940
She has thought of blowing up the fortune lode.

400
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,700
As long as she can get out of her predicament,

401
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,940
it doesn't matter who will
blow up the fortune lode.

402
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,020
If the Third Princess will look
for Minister Pei's help,

403
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,260
will you be as open-minded as you are now?

404
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,420
Sure.

405
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,740
Your Highness, where are you going?

406
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,620
I'm going to Chuchu.

407
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,060
Please don't make things difficult for us.

408
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,340
The Second Princess said

409
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,540
you must not leave the mansion.

410
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,300
But I will.

411
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,180
Stop.

412
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,700
Qianqian, you are so willful.

413
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,060
We've given you everything you wanted
since you were little.

414
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,260
Our pampering has made you what you are now,

415
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,620
a person who respects nothing.

416
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,260
Chuchu,

417
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,780
we have an emergency. No time to dawdle.

418
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,020
Take your troops to the mine

419
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,980
and save over 100 miners.

420
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,260
Go now or it'll be too late.

421
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,740
We are talking about over 100 miners.

422
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,660
Other people can show no care,

423
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,300
but you can't. You are the heroine...

424
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,540
I mean... the princess.

425
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,100
It's a good opportunity for you
to win a reputation.

426
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,540
At this time,

427
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,340
you're still thinking about those miners.

428
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,620
Just blow up the fortune lode

429
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,060
and you'll be able to rescue all the miners.

430
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,780
Blow up the fortune lode?

431
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,100
You want me to end up

432
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,580
like you?

433
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,100
Be deposed by our mother.

434
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,660
Lose my princess's title.

435
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,100
Let people reproach me
and petition for my sacrifice?

436
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,420
That's different.

437
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,660
I stole the Dragon Bone
to satisfy my selfish desire.

438
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,620
You won't do the same thing.

439
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,580
If you blow up the fortune lode,

440
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,620
our mother will flare up for a moment,

441
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,820
but you will save the people

442
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
and win people's hearts.

443
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,460
People's hearts are more important

444
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,580
than mother's mood.

445
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,940
For you,

446
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,580
people's hearts are no doubt more important.

447
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,980
Because you are already loved by mother.

448
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,900
You know what,

449
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,900
when I was fighting in other places

450
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,300
and facing danger,

451
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,300
mother stayed by your bed

452
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,420
and took no interest in my situation.

453
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,260
Just then,

454
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,020
she finally smiled at me.

455
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,500
Do you know why?

456
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,180
Because I asked to guard you with troops.

457
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,540
Mother only cares about you.

458
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,620
But again and again, you have done things

459
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,340
to place her in a dilemma.

460
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,340
Chuchu.

461
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,340
Has it ever occurred to you

462
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,500
that if I had been the person
who stole the Dragon Bone,

463
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,020
I might have

464
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
died now?

465
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,540
That's not true, Chuchu.

466
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,780
You would have followed heaven's will
if you had stolen the Dragon Bone.

467
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,660
And I only stole the Dragon Bone to...

468
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,260
Never mind.

469
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,820
... save my life.

470
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,820
I'll just guard you well

471
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,700
and save myself from our mother's reprimand.

472
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,140
Chuchu.

473
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,260
You'll be the future City Owner.

474
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,180
How can you give up over 100 lives

475
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,060
to avoid mother's reprimand?

476
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,140
Is your reputation as a princess

477
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,860
more important than over 100 lives?

478
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,740
I can't destroy the fortune lode for them.

479
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,980
For those miners,

480
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,180
sacrificing themselves for Huayuan City

481
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,420
is their privilege

482
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,100
as Huayuan's citizens.

483
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,500
Qianqian, I hope

484
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,700
you'll consider others more from now on.

485
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,420
Keep your nose clean.

486
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,700
If you hadn't stolen the Dragon Bone,

487
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,660
maybe mother would have ordered people

488
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,900
to blow up the fortune lode

489
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,260
and rescue the miners.

490
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,940
Escort her back to her room.

491
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,020
But if I had behaved,

492
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,540
I might have died already.

493
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,300
Qianqian,

494
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,620
you have failed to get Chuchu's help.

495
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,340
Try to seek help from someone else.

496
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,460
Someone else?

497
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,540
Who can help me now?

498
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,300
Try to rely on men.

499
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Men?

500
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,980
Men.

501
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,380
You mean...

502
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,420
Find Pei Heng.

503
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,100
Your Highness.

504
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,780
Your Highness.

505
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
I've been told that you're ill.

506
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,820
What's the problem?

507
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,460
Why didn't you have Princess Royal
diagnose you?

508
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,340
No.

509
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,620
I'm not ill. I lied to you.

510
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,900
I have invited you here today
to ask for a favor.

511
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,620
I want to leave the mansion.

512
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,020
Since you don't want to stay here,

513
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,460
I'll take you out.

514
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,100
I knew you would help me.

515
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,580
She would rather ask Pei Heng
for help than ask me.

516
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,620
Pei Heng can't carry heavy loads.

517
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,100
He has no troop to command.

518
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,220
What can he do?

519
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,260
Young Master,

520
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,340
you said as long as the Third Princess
could get out of her predicament,

521
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,060
it didn't matter who would
blow up the fortune lode.

522
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
It didn't matter?

523
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,700
I'd like to see

524
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,780
how can they explode the fortune lode

525
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,580
without my help.

526
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,420
(Yueli Mansion)

527
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Your Highness.

528
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,420
What are you...

529
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,380
I heard Qianqian is ill.

530
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,100
I told the kitchen staff
to cook her favorite food.

531
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,660
Your Highness,

532
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,820
the Third Princess has gone to bed.

533
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,980
It's inconvenient for her to meet you now.

534
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,180
Maybe you should leave.

535
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,740
What? But Minister Pei just left.

536
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,780
She is already in bed now?

537
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,260
Yeah. The Third Princess is feeling dizzy.

538
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
I think she has gone to bed.

539
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,220
She must be angry with me.

540
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,820
Qianqian,

541
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,460
I know my harsh words have hurt your feelings.

542
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,180
Don't be mad.

543
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,300
I was just having a fit.

544
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm keeping you indoors for your own good.

545
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,420
The outside world is turbulent.

546
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,980
Everyone is looking to condemn you.

547
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Mother and I have no choice

548
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,260
but to make such an unfortunate decision.

549
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,260
Stop being mad.

550
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,540
Have some food.

551
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:20,980
Qianqian.

552
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,940
Your Highness, uh...

553
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,620
Your Highness, spare me.

554
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,020
You are a servant from Pei Heng's mansion.

555
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,380
So dizzy.

556
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,740
What a cunning escape plan.

557
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,140
Didn't she think of my situation
before running away?

558
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,780
I'm finally out.

559
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,780
Your mansion has become a target
of public criticism.

560
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,700
Come with me to my mansion.

561
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,220
Nobody will dare to harm you there.

562
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,220
No. I must go to the mine.

563
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,780
You asked me to take you out,

564
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,820
so you could rescue those miners?

565
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,060
Yes.

566
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,740
How are you going to rescue them?

567
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,060
Blow up the fortune lode.

568
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,660
Have you thought of the consequences?

569
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,660
Now the officials,

570
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,100
peddlers and dogsbodies

571
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,100
wish to sacrifice you to assuage
the people's indignation.

572
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,540
If you blow up the fortune lode,

573
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,180
things will get worse.

574
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,300
Even Her Majesty might not
be able to save you,

575
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,140
not to mention me.

576
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,380
But...

577
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,460
Success hinges on human efforts.

578
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,500
If you never try, you'll never know.

579
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,580
We are talking about over 100 lives, after all.

580
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,340
It's nothing to joke about.

581
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,340
But the miners

582
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
are all men.

583
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,140
Men and women

584
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,140
aren't different in essence.

585
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,500
They are all human lives.

586
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,140
I didn't know you held this kind of opinion.

587
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,900
Please turn into that alley ahead.

588
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,100
Pei Heng.

589
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,900
Zi Rui and I agreed to meet at the mine.

590
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,300
I have to rush there.

591
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,620
Qianqian.

592
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
I'm going with you.

593
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,380
I can't let you dive into danger alone.

594
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,380
No need, Pei Heng.

595
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,060
I can't get you in trouble.

596
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,700
I'm already in trouble, so I'm not afraid.

597
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,940
But you should stay out of it.

598
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,740
Got to go. Thank you.

599
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,860
Qianqian. Qianqian.

600
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
I've failed you.

601
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,220
Qianqian has run away.

602
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,380
You...

603
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,740
Why didn't you dodge?

604
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,940
What? The Third Princess has gone to the mine?

605
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,540
But...

606
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,260
Come on. I'm going to the mine.

607
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,140
Mother.

608
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,860
Does mother

609
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,940
only care about Qianqian?

610
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,460
Your Highness.

611
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,620
What should we do now?

612
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,740
Please give an order.

613
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,220
Inform the City Guards

614
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,900
to come with me to Lin's mine.

615
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,700
Yes.

616
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,500
Are our people in place?

617
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,980
Our people are in place,

618
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,940
making sure the Third Princess won't be harmed.

619
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,140
But Young Master,

620
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,780
Minister Pei will have people

621
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,300
help the Third Princess rescue the miners.

622
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,780
Why are we waiting here?

623
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,940
Pei Heng can't help Qianqian.

624
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
What does a person need

625
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
to blow up the fortune lode?

626
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,780
The fortune lode.

627
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
What else?

628
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,740
Explosives.

629
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,140
She will beg me eventually.

630
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,300
Xuanhu City

631
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,380
uses black stones to make explosives.

632
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,420
Huayuan City uses black stones
to make fireworks.

633
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,300
What's the use of fireworks?

634
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,060
Have you got everything ready?

635
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,740
I have got everything ready.

636
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,140
Good.

637
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,340
We have no explosives.

638
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,940
We have no explosives?

639
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,460
How am I going to blow up
the fortune lode without explosives?

640
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,980
Can I use you to blow it up?

641
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,620
Should I use you to blow it up?

642
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,140
Huayuan City has always
produced nothing but fireworks.

643
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,060
Only Xuanhu City produces explosives.

644
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,820
Right. Han Shuo nearly destroyed Huayuan

645
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,140
with explosives in the later stages.

646
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,860
Come on.

647
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,020
Who owns explosives in Huayuan City?

648
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,140
Who?

649
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,700
The Second Princess.

650
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,900
The Second Princess is also
the Minister of Defense.

651
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,300
She definitely owns explosives.

652
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,340
If Chuchu sees me,

653
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,140
she'll catch me and send me back to the mansion
before I could ask her for explosives.

654
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,900
Minister Pei.

655
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Minister Pei is the only son
of the late Minister of Defense Pei.

656
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,860
If he asks the City Guards for help,
they will do him a favor.

657
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,260
Minister Pei never intervenes

658
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,580
in the City Guards' affairs.

659
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,820
I can't trouble him.

660
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,500
Lin Qi.

661
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,500
She is the richest person in Huayuan City.

662
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,420
She can purchase explosives at a high price.

663
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,620
Yeah.

664
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,820
Lin Qi can spend a lot of money

665
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,620
on explosives to blow up her own mine.

666
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,340
Between Lin Qi and you,

667
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,100
one of you must have been brain-damaged.

668
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,420
What's wrong with them?

669
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,300
They even considered seeking Lin Qi's help.

670
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,500
You simply never crossed their minds.

671
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,660
This is...

672
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,580
an emergency.

673
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,500
It's inevitable for them to neglect the obvious.

674
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,180
I'm going to kick you to death.

675
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,780
No. Give me more time to think.

676
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,380
Who is there?

677
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,100
A bamboo tube.

678
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,380
Fireworks.

679
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,540
I got it!

680
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,220
Finally.

681
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,500
The owner of the grocery shop.

682
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,580
Han Shuo, what brought you here?

683
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm just passing by.

684
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,940
We heard

685
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,260
what you said.

686
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,780
You are really thoughtful.

687
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,940
You have considered seeking help
from everyone in Huayuan City.

688
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,780
But I don't know anyone

689
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,180
who can give me explosives.

690
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,180
Our Young Master is standing right before you.

691
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,100
Can't you see?

692
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,420
I'll be in the toilet.

693
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,860
Han Shuo.

694
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,820
Right. Xuanhu City produces explosives.

695
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,500
But will you help me?

696
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,780
We are on different sides.

697
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,180
I understand your doubts.

698
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,460
But this is a life-and-death matter.
It's an emergency.

699
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,540
I won't gamble on human lives.

700
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,460
A life-and-death matter?

701
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,460
It turns out Han Shuo

702
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,140
isn't as cold and heartless as I thought.

703
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,060
This is what a hero should look like.

704
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,580
What is a hero?

705
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,820
It's like the male lead of a story.

706
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,580
Then can the hero

707
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,660
win the beauty's heart?

708
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,380
He usually can as long as he doesn't die.

709
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,380
Fortunately,

710
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,540
my heart disease has been cured by you.

711
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,220
Don't worry.

712
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,860
I have planted the explosives.

713
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,260
The explosives can be detonated anytime.

714
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,820
It's dangerous.

715
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,540
Let me go.

716
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,300
No. I should go.

717
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,220
You can't go.

718
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,180
You are the precious Third Princess.

719
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,500
You'll regain your title sooner or later.

720
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
You had better be careful.

721
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,340
I'll go in your stead.

722
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,660
No.

723
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,900
You are the beloved son
of the owner of Xuanhu City.

724
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,740
You'll achieve greatness in the future.

725
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,500
How can you take such a risk for me?

726
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,500
Of course I should go.

727
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,220
I said I'd let no harm come to you.

728
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,420
It's so dangerous.

729
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,580
I should go.

730
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,940
Young Master, you don't know

731
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,540
how important you are to me.

732
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,620
If anything happens to you,
the whole situation will change.

733
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,820
No. You can't go. I'll go.

734
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,300
But without you,

735
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,020
my life would have no meaning.

736
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,660
Then...

737
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
Then we can go together.

738
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,660
Okay.

739
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,140
Qianqian.

740
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,100
Have I blown the right structure?

741
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,940
Step back.

742
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,940
Step back further.

743
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,060
What is the meaning of this?

744
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,140
You sprinkled dust

745
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,700
on the Third Princess.

746
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
Come on.

747
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,860
Qianqian.

748
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,580
Hurry.

749
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Chen Qianqian!

750
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,460
Isn't this Lin Qi?

751
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,580
Are you here to help? Let's do it together.

752
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,620
Chen Qianqian,

753
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,180
you not only disbanded
my Music and Dance Academy,

754
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,900
but also blew up my black stone mine.

755
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,900
I even blew up the fortune lode.

756
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,900
Who cares about your mine?

757
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,780
How funny.

758
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,100
I'll teach you a lesson today!

759
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,900
Get her!

760
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,060
Stop. Stop.

761
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,660
You're defending her again?

762
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,700
Your people

763
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,580
are no match for my guards.

764
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,660
Leave.

765
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Stop!

766
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,700
Arrest the criminal

767
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,940
who destroyed the fortune lode!

768
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,620
Your Highness,

769
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,780
you also want to capture Qianqian?

770
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,700
Minister Pei,

771
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm afraid your guards

772
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,860
are no match for the City Guards.

773
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,540
Arrest her.

774
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Stop!

775
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,300
Stop!

776
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,620
I pay respect to you, Your Majesty.

777
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,500
What,

778
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,380
are you going to arrest

779
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,060
your younger sister as if she is a criminal?

780
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,260
Chen Qianqian blew up the fortune lode.

781
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,420
She must not be exempted from punishment.

782
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Please punish her, Mother.

783
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,300
Outrageous!

784
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,900
How can you?

785
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,180
How dare you?

786
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,300
Don't worry.

787
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,460
My people have always been around.

788
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,060
I will keep you safe.

789
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,980
How many troops have you
deployed here secretly?

790
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,420
The whole crew must be here.

791
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,500
This must be a big scene. Gosh.

792
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,780
I have never written such a costly scene.

793
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,180
We have found them! We have found them!

794
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,660
Come and rescue them!

795
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,380
Coming!

796
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,740
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

797
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,460
Here. Be careful.

798
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,860
Here.

799
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
Be careful. Be careful.

800
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,220
Come on. Sit down.

801
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,780
Is anyone left down there?

802
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,780
No. No one.

803
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,660
Everyone has been taken out.

804
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,220
Qianqian.

805
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,580
Are you okay?

806
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,140
You are...

807
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,620
The Third... Third Princess.

808
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,860
How come you...

809
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,500
The Third Princess saved you.

810
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,540
The Third Princess.

811
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

812
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

813
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

814
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,620
No! The fortune lode is gone!

815
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,380
Your Majesty.

816
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,900
Chen Qianqian destroyed the Dragon Bone
for her selfish interests earlier.

817
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,300
Now she blown up the fortune lode
without permission.

818
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,660
Huayuan City's long-standing business

819
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,100
has been ruined by her.

820
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,860
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

821
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,060
Your Majesty.

822
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,260
The Dragon Bone and fortune lode

823
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,220
have decided Huayuan City's fate
for about a thousand years.

824
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,540
Chen Qianqian must die,

825
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,620
unless Huayuan City obtains another treasure.

826
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,940
How dare you!

827
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,500
Your Majesty, please listen to the citizens.

828
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

829
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,540
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

830
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,060
Your Majesty, please sentence Chen Qianqian to death.

831
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,540
Your Majesty.

832
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,500
please pardon the Third Princess.

833
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,260
The Third Princess is kind-hearted.

834
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,700
She loves people
as if they are her children.

835
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,020
Your Majesty.

836
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:55,620
Please pardon the Third Princess.

837
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,220
Chen Qianqian must not
be exempted from punishment,

838
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,020
unless another treasure shows up

839
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,340
to fill in for the lost Dragon Bone
and fortune lode.

840
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,100
Otherwise, our ancestors

841
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,380
won't rest in peace.

842
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,540
You have me.

843
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,220
Don't be afraid.

844
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,100
For unlucky people,

845
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,620
everything can be a torment.

846
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,580
But for lucky people,

847
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,300
things can always take a turn for the better.

848
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,100
Lin Qi,

849
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,220
look what this is.

850
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,940
The fire box.

851
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,340
Petroleum! Petroleum!

852
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,940
Petroleum!

853
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,300
It's petroleum.

854
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Petroleum!

855
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,740
It's true that the black stone mine
is the foundation of Huayuan City.

856
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,020
But petroleum

857
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,900
is even more precious than the black stone mine.

858
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,500
Yes.

859
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,300
Petroleum is also known as black water.

860
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,420
One cubic meter of black water is
worth more than one dou of gold.

861
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,380
From what we are seeing now,

862
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,340
enormous wealth is buried

863
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,620
under the fortune lode.

864
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,660
The fact that the Third Princess risked her life
to save the miners

865
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,540
has touched her ancestors.
They have bestowed this treasure on us.

866
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,900
The Third Princess has unearthed
the black water mine.

867
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,060
Heaven has blessed us

868
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,540
with the black water mine.

869
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,860
Heaven has blessed us

870
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,620
with the black water mine.

871
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,980
Heaven has blessed us

872
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,460
with the black water mine.

873
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,900
Heaven has blessed us

874
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,420
with the black water mine.

875
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,940
Heaven has blessed us

876
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,620
with the black water mine.

877
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,740
Can you hear what they are calling you?

878
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,860
The Third Princess.

879
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,660
In the past, they called you the Third Princess

880
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,180
to taunt you, and mostly, to tease you.

881
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,420
But now they are calling you the Third Princess

882
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,140
to show submission, and mostly, to revere you.

883
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,340
Heaven has blessed us with the black water mine.

884
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,780
You deserve the title of the Third Princess.

885
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,500
Heaven has blessed us

886
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,860
with the black water mine.

887
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,500
It'd take more than a thousand years

888
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,540
for petroleum to take form.

889
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,860
It'd take a million years.

890
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,860
As they said,

891
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,900
time can solve every problem.

892
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,460
Heaven has blessed us with the black water mine.

893
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,380
(City Owner's Mansion)

894
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Your Majesty,

895
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,340
the black water mine is extremely rare.

896
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
I only heard of it from legends.

897
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,580
Its value is even greater than the Dragon Bone.

898
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,900
It'll be very conducive
to stabilizing the city

899
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,060
and benefiting the people.

900
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,500
We can expect the city to prosper soon.

901
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,500
All this

902
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,820
is the result of the Third Princess's
good fortune.

903
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,900
Chen Qianqian has become a commoner.

904
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,980
She is not the Third Princess.

905
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,540
Her Majesty's fortune is people's fortune.

906
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,780
Now everyone is commending the Third Princess

907
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,580
for blowing up the fortune lode
and saving the people.

908
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,980
The black water mine shows our ancestors'
approval of the Third Princess.

909
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,780
Your Majesty,

910
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,140
please restore the Third Princess's title

911
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,020
to show your benevolence and grace.

912
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,220
Your Majesty.

913
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,060
Alright.

914
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,460
Minister Yang is right.

915
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,540
Qianqian has made a great contribution.

916
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,420
Her title shall be restored immediately.

917
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,380
You're wise, Your Majesty.

918
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,620
You're wise, Your Majesty.

919
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,860
Your Highness, what would you like to eat today?

920
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,060
Delicacies of all kinds.
I'll eat anything expensive.

921
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,940
Yes.

922
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,500
-Your Highness? -Your Highness!

923
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,020
Your Highness.

924
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,860
Stop! Don't run.

925
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,980
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

926
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,380
I have got my title back.

927
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,060
Why are they still chasing me?

928
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,780
We have no guard. We must run.

929
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,140
Han Shuo.

930
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,500
Wait.

931
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,780
Your Highness, why are you running?

932
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,300
If I didn't run, you'd hit me.

933
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,500
Those tomatoes are really big.

934
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,220
Yeah.

935
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,260
Your Highness, you are mistaken.

936
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,940
These are our gifts for you.

937
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,020
Your Highness.

938
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,420
We are sorry for being rude
to you the other day.

939
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,420
My eldest brother worked at Lin's mine.

940
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,940
When I heard of the mine disaster,

941
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,180
I thought I would never see him again.

942
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,700
Young Master Han and you rescued him.

943
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,500
Thank you.

944
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,500
Yes. Yes.

945
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,460
It's okay. No trouble. No trouble at all.

946
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,020
You risked your lives to save them.

947
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,980
We can never pay you back.

948
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,900
These eggs

949
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,980
are laid by our hens.

950
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,700
And we grew these vegetables.

951
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,300
All these things are for you.

952
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,260
Let me do it.

953
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,100
These things

954
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,620
are far more delicious than the delicacies.

955
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,540
That's right.

956
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,980
Thank you.
