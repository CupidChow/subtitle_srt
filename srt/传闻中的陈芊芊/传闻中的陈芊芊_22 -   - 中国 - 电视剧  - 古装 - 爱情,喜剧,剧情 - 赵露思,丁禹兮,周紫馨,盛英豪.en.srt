23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,020
(Episode 22)

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,860
(Xingzi Mansion)

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,820
Your Highness, I...

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,380
Please forgive my incompetence.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,020
Lin Qi suddenly showed up

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,380
and saved Chen Qianqian.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,460
Lin Qi is still alive?

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Su Ziying has been captured.

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,500
They've run away towards Xuanhu City.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
You good-for-nothings.

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,060
Send guys to chase them.

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,300
Make sure Chen Qianqian is killed

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,500
before they arrive at Xuanhu City.

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,380
Got it.

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,340
Mr. Pei.

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Minister Pei.

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,580
You can leave.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,620
Got it.

41
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,900
The City Owner has made
an official statement.

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,740
For the common people in Huayuan City,

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,940
Chen Qianqian is already dead.

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,260
Now that the Princess Royal's
legs haven't been cured,

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,060
you'll be the only candidate
for Crown Princess.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
Why do you still not let Qianqian go?

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,740
She's left Huayuan City,

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,340
but what if my mother changes her mind

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,540
and allows her to come back?

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,300
Are you determined

51
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,700
to kill your sister who grew up with you

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,940
just for that reason?

53
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,740
In case your mother knows about it,

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,660
I'm not sure

55
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,220
if I can save you again.

56
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,540
Pei Heng,

57
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,740
do you think

58
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,900
you can make indiscreet criticisms

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,100
because you interceded
with my mother on my behalf?

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,460
As for flower token,

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,580
I haven't got even with you.

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,980
When my mother forgives me,

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,540
I'll still be

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,860
Minister of Defense of Huayuan City.

65
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,940
I don't know

66
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,500
if your mother will forgive you,

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,300
but don't forget

68
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,780
City Guards evolved from
the army of the Pei family.

69
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,020
It's right and proper that

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,460
a descendant of the Pei family
serves as Minister of Defense.

71
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,380
It depends on if you can convince everyone.

72
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,580
I don't think

73
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,060
a man can hold this position

74
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,460
for a long time.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,660
Are you being afraid?

76
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,820
I swear to God

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,740
I won't let you regret
the decision you made today.

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,100
What are you doing?

79
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,140
I want to always look at you like this.

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,260
I feel your eyes are telling me

81
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,740
something is wrong.

82
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,100
Thinking of the night we spent in prison,

83
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,500
I can't control my feelings.

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,140
In...

85
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,620
In broad daylight, exercise self-restraint.

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,620
We'll go to Xuanhu City
by way of Weimeng Mountain.

87
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,300
Thinking of what happened
in the storage room of the inn,

88
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,860
I can't help

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,900
feeling regretful.

90
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,460
You... Go to Bai Ji if you regret it.

91
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,780
Stay away from me.

92
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,060
(The Inn)

93
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,020
Sir, my liquor.

94
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,460
Waiter, liquor please.

95
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,300
Just a second.

96
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,980
Here it is.

97
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,220
Fill it up.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,020
This way please.

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,060
Waiter. Hurry up.

100
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,780
Well.

101
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,220
If Orange got married to Banana,

102
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,020
their kid would be

103
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,780
Banange?

104
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Guys!

105
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,460
Why are you here?

106
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,340
I didn't expect to see you again.

107
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Your Highness,

108
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,780
before you left,

109
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,860
Young Master Han insisted
on taking us with you.

110
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,340
We don't know why

111
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,500
and we don't dare to ask.

112
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,420
Maybe he's afraid you'll feel bored,

113
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,900
so he wants us

114
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,180
to divert you from boredom
by telling you stories.

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,780
Congratulations,

116
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,860
Your Highness.

117
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,180
You've dodged open and covert attacks.

118
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,940
You had a difficult time.

119
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,940
I'm glad you've survived
and come to the final episode.

120
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,300
I have to thank you
for your advice and suggestions.

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,100
I did it by good fortune.

122
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,700
As the saying goes,

123
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,140
two heads are better than one.

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,500
Actually, I wanted to see you

125
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,220
stay with Minister Pei.

126
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,260
You know nothing about it.

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,220
The more intense the contradiction is

128
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,260
between Crown Princess and Han Shuo,

129
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,580
the more devoted they are to each other.

130
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,620
You can't say that.

131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,820
Relationships are complicated.

132
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,900
Exactly.

133
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,980
No girl would fall in love with a man

134
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,620
who wanted to kill her
in the first place.

135
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,340
Right.

136
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,900
Who else could turn things around

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,700
like Crown Princess?

138
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,460
The Second Princess

139
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,180
was gentle at the beginning,

140
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,140
but now she's...

141
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,780
You can't judge people
only by their appearance.

142
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,860
Do you agree?

143
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,100
Yeah.

144
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,420
The Second Princess became like that
because of Crown Princess.

145
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,580
Hey. Wait.

146
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,380
You've known everything?

147
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,660
Apple.

148
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,460
Orange.

149
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Banana.

150
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,340
No.

151
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,940
When did you know that?

152
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,900
Here is the thing.

153
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,860
At the very beginning,

154
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,180
you wanted to fix up Banana and Apple, right?

155
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,820
You planned to give Apple
a chance to save Banana,

156
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,940
so you decided to take Banana

157
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,660
to the Music and Dance Academy.

158
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,020
Right.

159
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,580
When he was bullied there,

160
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
you'd let Apple show up

161
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,100
at the critical moment

162
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,420
to save him.

163
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,300
But that very day,

164
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,380
you took Young Master Han
to the Music and Dance Academy

165
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,620
and forced him to compete
with other musicians.

166
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,700
Um. Look.

167
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,740
The three of us are not idiots.

168
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,460
The clue was obvious.

169
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,340
Right?

170
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,140
I admire you.

171
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,100
Your Highness,

172
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,980
why do you know people around you so well?

173
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,780
And you know lots of little-known secrets,

174
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,940
like where Dragon Bone was hidden

175
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,580
and how Young Master Han
suffered heart disease.

176
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,500
You often foretold things.

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,580
It's like...

178
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,500
It's like you live inside a story

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,540
and I live outside it.

180
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,780
Exactly.

181
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,500
Could it be that...

182
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,700
...you're an immortal?

183
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,180
Whatever.

184
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,260
As you like.

185
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,260
Anyway,

186
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,500
it's true that Apple is Chuchu,

187
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,980
Orange is me

188
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,180
and Banana is Han Shuo.

189
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,100
I created this story.

190
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,860
Someday,

191
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,940
when the three of you

192
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,300
enter the scripts you write,

193
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,100
the same thing will happen to you.

194
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,740
In this case,

195
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,340
you created us.

196
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,380
Don't say that.

197
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,180
When I go back to Huayuan,

198
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,340
I'll write a book about you

199
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,780
so that your name will
be remembered by posterity.

200
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,820
Right.

201
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,580
Sir?

202
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,060
Sir?

203
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
Han Shuo.

204
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,780
Hey. Han Shuo. Wait for me.

205
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,300
Han Shuo.

206
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,380
Han Shuo, stop running.

207
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,900
Han Shuo.

208
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,540
Hey. I can explain.

209
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,540
It hurts.

210
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,820
It hurts.

211
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
On the carriage, you said

212
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
you'd be nice to me all your life.

213
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,700
It's just a short time ago
and you already began to regret it?

214
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
If I hadn't heard your conversation,

215
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,940
would you always hide it from me?

216
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,700
I planned to explain to you

217
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
after we arrive at Xuanhu City.

218
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,780
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

219
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,340
There were a lot of things

220
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,460
I couldn't tell you at the beginning.

221
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,460
You framed me on purpose for hurting Su Mu

222
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,500
to send me into exile.

223
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,860
That's because I wanted
to avoid the previous ending.

224
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,860
My mother, Lin Qi and Lu Peng...

225
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,740
They ended up having
a stroke or being killed,

226
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,660
the same way as I wrote in the script.

227
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,380
I was afraid you'd also end up like that.

228
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,900
But later,

229
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,780
my mother woke up

230
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,700
and Lin Qi didn't die,

231
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,260
so I felt relieved.

232
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,860
I planned to explain to you,

233
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
but you hated me so much at that time.

234
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,100
You didn't want to talk to me at all.

235
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,940
Why did you want to push
me away to Chen Chuchu?

236
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,540
I stopped doing that when I realized

237
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,860
I was into you.

238
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,700
You even made use of my heart disease.

239
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,700
I stole Dragon Bone

240
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,220
and cured you.

241
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,260
You forged a tip-off

242
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,780
and asked Chen Chuchu to catch me.

243
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,180
You already knew it long ago.

244
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
I...

245
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,100
You designed my heart disease, right?

246
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,180
As I said,

247
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,540
I cured you.

248
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
It's true,

249
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,700
but it's designed by you.

250
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,580
Why do I bother to explain to you?

251
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,820
What's up?

252
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,980
You're not mad at me anymore?

253
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,020
I'm just

254
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,980
so shocked.

255
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,340
But I finally understand

256
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,260
why you often lied to me,

257
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,340
why everything I did

258
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,060
went against your original intention,

259
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,180
and why you're entirely different

260
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,180
from any other girl I've ever seen.

261
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,020
I once complained that you were heartless.

262
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,380
I couldn't guess how serious
you were about me

263
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,100
and I didn't know when you
were telling the truth.

264
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,780
But at this moment, I can tell

265
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,260
you're into me.

266
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,540
It's true.

267
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,380
That's enough for me.

268
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,420
Xiaoqian, I've finally got you.

269
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,540
The complete you,

270
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,100

296

Screenwriter?

Just like a storyteller.

298
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,500
From the two countries

299
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,380
with different systems

300
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,460
to every tree and bush,

301
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,060
all those were created by me.

302
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,500
So, as for who they are,

303
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,780
what they'll do

304
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,980
and what setbacks they'll go through...

305
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
I basically know everything.

306
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,620
That's why I knew you wanted to kill me
as soon as I came here.

307
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,940
That's also why I could survive that crisis.

308
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,700
So,

309
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,220
actually, I'm just
a character in your script.

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,740
No.

311
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,860
At the beginning, I also thought

312
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,340
you were just a group
of fictional characters,

313
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,100
but later, I found each of you

314
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,460
had your own emotions.

315
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,820
I didn't create that.

316
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,020
You have real feelings,

317
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,260
just like us.

318
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,460
How is the world you live in?

319
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,980
Is it like Huayuan City

320
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,180
or Xuanhu City?

321
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
Our world?

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,540
In our world,

323
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,740
as for if men or women

324
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,460
have the final say,

325
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,860
sometimes it's like Huayuan City

326
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,380
and sometimes like Xuanhu City.

327
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,140
That's a subject for debate,

328
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,820
so I wrote this story.

329
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Is it possible

330
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,220
your world is also created by a screenwriter?

331
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,420
Maybe.

332
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,940
A mixture of truth and falsehood.
Who can tell it clearly?

333
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,020
Are all screenwriters in your world

334
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,180
as lovely as you?

335
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,940
Yes, in addition,

336
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,500
they're talented.

337
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,100
Every screenwriter

338
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,620
is concentrated

339
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,660
when they're writing a story.

340
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,860
Sometimes,

341
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,420
there are some flaws in the plot.

342
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,140
Sometimes, it's cheesy.

343
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,780
Sometimes,

344
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,820
the leading roles become self-abandoners.

345
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,660
But overall, a screenwriter loves
every character created by him or her.

346
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,100
Sometimes, they even fall
in love with a character.

347
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,380
Did you

348
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,980
fall in love with Pei Heng?

349
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,980
It's a different case.

350
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,540
You're a hero.

351
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,980
A hero

352
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,580
has to stay with a heroine.

353
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,740
The male supporting role

354
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,020
belongs to all.

355
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,860
Did Pei Heng know about that?

356
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,260
Of course not.

357
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,740
Don't tell him.

358
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I want to be the only one

359
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,180
who knows about it.

360
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,380
How does the story end?

361
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,260
At the end of the story,

362
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,860
Chuchu succeeded my mother as City Owner.

363
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,380
The sun and the moon were up
in the sky at the same time.

364
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,420
The gate to Heaven was wide open.

365
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,380
I fell in asleep after I wrote that

366
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,740
and then I came here.

367
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,580
So, I guess

368
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,060
I can't go back

369
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,980
until the sun and the moon are up
in the sky at the same time

370
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,780
and the gate to Heaven is wide open.

371
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,580
Are you afraid

372
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,620
I may leave?

373
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,740
Of course not.

374
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,940
After you leave,

375
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,380
I'll stay in Xuanhu City

376
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
and marry 300 concubines.

377
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,580
I'll have a different woman every day.

378
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,260
So, I have no time to miss you.

379
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,220
But a year

380
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,900
has 365 days.

381
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,860
How about the remaining 65 days?

382
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,940
In the remaining 65 days...

383
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,300
None of your business.

384
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,460

Judging from the days,

403
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,860
they must have arrived at Xuanhu City.

404
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,380
Your Highness,

405
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,540
will Chen Qianqian borrow
troops from Xuanhu City

406
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,300
and make a comeback?

407
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
Chen Qianqian is unruly and self-willed.

408
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,340
She dared to make trouble

409
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,620
because our mother dotes on her.

410
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,860
In Xuanhu City, men are in power.

411
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,940
She couldn't have
a chance to stir up trouble.

412
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,660
(Xuanhu City)

413
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,580
The one who's leading the horse
is our young master?

414
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,820
He's leading the horse for Ms. Chen?

415
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Is it really okay?

416
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,620
You and I are a couple.

417
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,940
Let's act here the same way

418
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,660
as we do in Huayuan.

419
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,140
Young Master, welcome back!

420
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,300
Young Master, His Majesty
and Her Majesty asked you...

421
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,060
...and accompanying persons
to enter the city as soon as possible.

422
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,740
They've been waiting for a long time.

423
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,580
I'll take you to the City Owner's Mansion

424
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,220
to meet my father and mother.

425
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,620
People here are so hospitable to us.

426
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,220
They're not welcoming us.

427
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,900
I used to suffer heart disease.

428
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
Such a thing has never happened.

429
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,820
Of course,

430
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,940
it won't happen again.

431
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,100
Do you know where Han Shuo is?

432
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,620
Our young master needs to pay respects
to His Majesty and Her Majesty.

433
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,220
Miss, please wait for him in the back garden

434
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,940
with other ladies.

435
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
You called her Miss? How dare you?

436
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,340
She's the Third Princess of Huayuan City

437
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,100
and the respected Crown Princess.

438
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
She was.

439
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,780
Repeat it if you dare.

440
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,740
Forget about it. When in Rome,
do as the Romans do.

441
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
Sir, please stay here.

442
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,660
Males and females are treated
differently in Xuanhu City.

443
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,980
The back garden is a place for
female members of noble families

444
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,420
to gather together.

445
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,620
As an irrelevant man, you can't go inside

446
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
unless you're castrated.

447
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,980
It's okay. I'll go there alone.

448
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,300
Wait for me here.

449
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,180
Xiaoqian, why are you nervous?

450
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,580
You felt just like a fish in water
when in Huayuan City.

451
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,580
Why are you like a fish
out of water in Xuanhu?

452
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,220
Life is like a drama. It all depends
on your acting skills.

453
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,180
You can do it.

454
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,940
Her Majesty arrives.

455
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,860
Lin Qi.

456
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,580
Lin Qi.

457
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,460
In Xuanhu City, men have the final say.

458
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,980
So, women here

459
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,900
are quiet and restrained.

460
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,780
It makes sense.

461
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,900
Sit down.

462
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,580
The feast starts now.

463
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,020
Your Majesty,

464
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,580
she's the girl brought back
by Young Master Han

465
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,700
from Huayuan City.

466
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
She's Chen Qianqian.

467
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,900
Nice to meet you, Your Majesty.

468
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm Han Shuo's wife.

469
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
Are you Qianqian?

470
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes.

471
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,020
Enjoy your meal first.

472
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,060
In Xuanhu City,

473
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,100
a married woman needs
to look after parents-in-law.

474
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,380
When Her Majesty is having a meal,

475
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,060
you need to distribute the foods for her.

476
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,500
Filial piety is the
foundation of all virtues.

477
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,660
I should do that.

478
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,620
Young Master Han won't leave
now that he's back, right?

479
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,420
I heard that his heart disease
has been cured.

480
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,860
He doesn't need to marry
into Huayuan City, right?

481
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,380
That was a lie in the first place.

482
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,020
As a man, how can he marry
into another family?

483
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,260
I heard women had
the final say in Huayuan City.

484
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,580
That's unacceptable.

485
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,380
I heard

486
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,180
Chen Qianqian claimed to be
a princess of the first rank.

487
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,660
It seems

488
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,940
she has a bad reputation.

489
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,700
She's unreasonable and ridiculous.

490
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,300
She's even illiterate.

491
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Rumors are fiercer than tigers.

492
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,860
What to do

493
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,260
if Han Shuo's mother misunderstands me too?

494
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,500
Your Majesty.

495
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,620
You're clever.

496
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,860
I'm expert at food.

497
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,300
Good.

498
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,900
Tell me what else you like
to do at ordinary times.

499
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,020
Nothing special.

500
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,980
I've been learning poetry
at clan school since childhood.

501
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,660
I help my mother deal with
public affairs when I'm available.

502
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,300
Sometimes,

503
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,020
I discuss poetry and prose with my sisters.

504
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,900
On the spur of the moment,

505
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,940
I'll go hunting in the mountains.

506
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,300
I'll play the game of go
with my teacher when I'm tired.

507
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,260
When I'm in the streets,
I'll help those in need.

508
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,300
Once the common people are in trouble,

509
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,660
I'll lead troops to clean up
bandits in the mountains.

510
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,180
I want to try my best

511
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,300
to be a qualified Crown Princess.

512
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,340
Do you have a sense of shame or not?

513
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,300
That's right.

514
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,580
The Third Princess is deeply respected

515
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,300
by the common people in Huayuan.

516
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,740
Lack of talent in a woman is a virtue.

517
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,540
In Xuanhu City,

518
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,340
what a woman should avoid most
is to be seen in public.

519
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,140
You call that "to be seen in public"?

520
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,260
Is there anything even worse?

521
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,100
She used to go to the Music
and Dance Academy eight times a day.

522
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,580
It's...

523
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,220
Um. It's not like what you thought.

524
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,700
The Music and Dance Academy
is run by my family.

525
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,060
It's conservative.

526
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,540
Can you keep silent?

527
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,820
Shuo, you must have had a rough time.

528
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,540
Has your heart disease been cured?

529
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,900
Father,

530
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,620
it has.

531
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,380
That's great.

532
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,820
Besides having your heart disease cured,

533
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,580
what else have you done?

534
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,220
To get rid of Huayuan's
Crown Princess, Chen Qianqian,

535
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,220
assassinate Huayuan's City Owner

536
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,220
and exploit the situation to conquer Huayuan

537
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,180
and occupy the black stone mine?

538
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,260
You had planned to do
all those things before you left,

539
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,900
but you ended up doing none of them.

540
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't want to make things
difficult for you.

541
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,700
You didn't kill Chen Qianqian,

542
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,740
Huayuan's City Owner

543
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,340
or any of the common people there.

544
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,820
I understand why you made
the decision and I agree to it.

545
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,900
I just want to ask you

546
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,340
why you didn't get the mine.

547
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,380
Oh my god. What are you doing?

548
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,380
I'm going back to Huayuan.

549
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,820
We can't.

550
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,900
The Second Princess wants to kill you.

551
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,140
I know.

552
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,380
I made this decision
after careful consideration.

553
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,620
Now that conditions are tough at both places,

554
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,340
why don't I choose the one

555
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,580
where I'm happier?

556
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,380
Am I right?

557
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,100
You still want to be comfortable and happy?

558
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,020
You're so careless.

559
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,420
You want to die?

560
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,740
Do you think I can survive if I stay here?

561
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,540
If you want to go back to your hometown,

562
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,300
you need to copy "Female Virtues" 100 times

563
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,140
and be familiar with the rules.

564
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,660
It's so hard for me!

565
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,060
What's up?

566
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,940
Don't you know that?

567
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,780
People in Xuanhu

568
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,580
give Crown Princess their attitude.

569
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
She also needs to follow "Three Obedience",
"Four Virtues" and "Seven Grounds for Divorce".

570
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,940
If she violates any of them,

571
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,180
you'll divorce her.

572
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,500
She is even requested to copy it 100 times.

573
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,340
How could it be like that?

574
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,340
It's always been the case in our city.

575
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,500
Why can't Young Master's wife obey them?

576
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,420
See?

577
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
I'll do it.

578
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,940
You'll get a divorce in the following cases:
you're not obedient to the in-laws;

579
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
you fail to have a female heir...

580
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,780
Oh, no.

581
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,540
You fail to have a male heir,
now that we're in Xuanhu.

582
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,620
You can leave.

583
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,780
I'll be here.

584
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,100
Madam, please serve our young master.

585
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
What are you doing?

586
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,900
In Xuanhu City,

587
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,620
men are superior.

588
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,260
It's against rules.

589
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,820
Yeah.

590
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,940
But in my mind,

591
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,220
you're always superior.

592
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,540
How do you like it? Is the water hot?

593
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,340
Enough.

594
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,740
They've left. Stop it.

595
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,660
Sorry for letting you suffer wrong.

596
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,620
Are you unhappy?

597
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,660
You're so nice.

598
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,660
Do you still want to go back?

599
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
No.

600
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,420
I don't want to leave you alone.

601
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,660
You were supposed to do
lots of things in Huayuan,

602
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,220
but you didn't do any of them

603
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,300
and even came back with a burden like me.

604
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,060
Did your father make
things difficult for you?

605
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,500
It's just Xuanhu City.

606
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,020
It's just a big tiger.

607
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,660
No big deal. I have thorns.

608
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,820
Right.

609
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,100
You're the most powerful.

610
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,260
Your Majesties.

611
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,060
How is it going with Han Shuo?

612
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,340
Young Master...

613
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,180
He's...

614
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,540
Go ahead!

615
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,620
He's washing the feet of
the woman from Huayuan City.

616
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,500
Ridiculous.

617
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,860
As a man,

618
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,900
how can he humiliate himself?

619
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,500
He's even washing her feet.

620
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,300
Is it hot?

621
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,700
No.

622
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:57,980
It's not.

623
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,300
Your Highness.

624
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,460
Your Highness, please go back.

625
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,140
Her Majesty is having a rest.

626
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,980
Please come here tomorrow.

627
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,660
My mother is not very well in health.

628
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,300
It's justified that she
has to have more rest.

629
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,820
In the coming days,

630
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll come and see her every day.

631
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,380
I hope she'll get better as soon as possible.

632
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,300
You're a dutiful daughter.

633
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,100
Let's go to the campsite.

634
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,540
Your Highness,

635
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,780
Mr. Pei has taken office
as Minister of Defense.

636
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,820
We...

637
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,580
I'd like to see how he's doing there.

638
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,380
Mr. Pei, what should we do

639
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,580
with prisoners of war from Xuanhu City?

640
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,700
Kill them.

641
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,340
Your Highness.

642
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,540
Your Highness,

643
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,540
you don't hold any official post in the army.

644
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,020
Now that you came here without permission,

645
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,620
you deserve to be punished
according to the military law.

646
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,260
I'm afraid you're lack of experience,

647
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,220
so I'm here to give you some advice.

648
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,140
People of Xuanhu are sinister and insidious.

649
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,740
They've been coveting

650
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,420
our black stone mine and black water mine.

651
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,540
As for them,

652
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,460
we should wipe them
off the face of the earth.

653
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,780
Your Highness,

654
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,180
who do you think deserve to be killed,

655
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,380
those who act in bad faith

656
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,780
or those who're faithful and true?

657
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,580
What do you mean?

658
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,700
We fought Xuanhu City Guards

659
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,460
because we serve different masters.

660
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,340
They were just under orders to attack us.

661
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,740
I don't think they deserve to die.

662
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,500
I'll let them do physical work in the mines.

663
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,180
You made such a big mistake,

664
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,140
but the City Owner forgave you

665
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,620
and gave you a chance to correct it.

666
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,700
Why can't you

667
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
give them a chance to survive?

668
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,980
You're a man.

669
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,420
You know nothing about war.

670
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,180
It's a life-or-death struggle

671
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,780
between Xuanhu and Huayuan.

672
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,620
To be merciful to your enemies

673
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,500
is to be cruel to yourself.

674
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,980
If you let them survive,

675
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,820
you're laying by trouble for the future.

676
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,580
Sooner or later,

677
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,460
you'll be killed by them.

678
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,300
I'm Minister of Defense.

679
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
As for how to deal with prisoners of war,

680
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
it's up to me.

681
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,860
I hope

682
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,620
you can convince your subordinates.

683
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,500
The late Minister Pei

684
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,340
once said,

685
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,420
as for war, pugnacity was the only virtue

686
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,180
and pacifism was the only vice.

687
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,420
Did you hear that?

688
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,940
That's what Minister of Defense
should be like.

689
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,180
She also said

690
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,620
only those who were really brave

691
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,300
could stay rational and end hostilities.

692
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,900
To stop use of weapons
and avoid war is truly military.

693
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,700
Mr. Pei is of a kindly disposition.
He's brave and persistent.

694
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,780
He's quite like his mother as for demeanor.

695
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,620
Mr. Pei, we're willing to follow you.

696
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,020
Books!

697
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,180
Newly published books.

698
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,940
"The Rumored Third Princess".

699
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,740
The Third Princess...

700
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,500
Sir,

701
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,060
is there any book about
the Third Princess and Minister Pei?

702
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,660
Yes. Sure.

703
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,740
There is also some inside information

704
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,460
about the Third Princess
and the Second Princess falling out.

705
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,540
It's wonderful.

706
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,700
Pitifully, the Second Princess
won in the end.

707
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,660
I like the Third Princess better.

708
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,900
Me too.

709
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,500
Having affection and faith,

710
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,780
the Third Princess is an excellent woman.

711
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,660
I'm wondering

712
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,220
why you're here.

713
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,420
Can you tell us

714
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,980
how you tamed your man?

715
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,180
It's spread everywhere
Young Master washed your feet.

716
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,380
As women, we were told to follow
Three Obedience and Four Virtues,

717
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,860
but actually, we hope

718
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,300
men can listen to us.

719
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,300
In my opinion,

720
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,140
you're living a happy life.

721
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,220
Young Master obeys you in every way.

722
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,380
I'm so envious.

723
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,700
I hope you can give me some good advice.

724
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,300
If I find a good husband in the future,

725
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,940
I'm sure to pay you back.

726
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,820
Please forgive me for being gossipy.

727
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,420
What does it mean to tame your man?

728
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,220
Let him obey you in every way
and do everything as you like?

729
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,820
No.

730
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,620
That's not real equality.

731
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,460
Actually, to learn how to tame your man,

732
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,780
you should learn to manage yourself first.

733
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,620
Manage myself?

734
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
As women,

735
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,740
we need to learn how
to stay true to ourselves,

736
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,620
how to add value to ourselves

737
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,180
and how to increase our husbands' value.

738
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Then they'll cherish and respect you.

739
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,020
If you love a man,

740
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,580
it doesn't mean

741
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,340
you need to rely on him and serve him

742
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,580
to get what you want from him.

743
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,180
In a relationship,

744
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,180
you need to

745
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
learn to manage yourself

746
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,420
so that he understands

747
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,140
the importance of

748
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,620
your existence.

749
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,140
In this case, he can't do without you.

750
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,140
It makes sense.

751
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,180
Unbelievable.

752
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,820
I've become a relationship expert.

753
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,900
If I told that actor surnamed Han about it,

754
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,500
he'd never believe it.

755
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,700
I see.

756
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,020
To put it simply,
we need to play hard-to-get.

757
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,820
We need to learn to lose temper.

758
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,820
We need to claim credit when necessary.

759
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,580
Playing the woman,
shedding tears or making a scene.

760
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,820
They all work.

761
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,860
Make sure he's afraid of you.

762
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,340
Right.

763
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,620
No. You're wrong.

764
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,220
What are you talking about? Wrong.

765
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,420
It's not like that.

766
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,660
Rewrite it.

767
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,940
Tear your notes.

768
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,820
Let's get started.

769
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,700
I don't know

770
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,180
what's happened to my wife.

771
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,540
She often gave me her attitude recently.

772
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,060
She found fault with everything.

773
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,180
Someone might have seduced her

774
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,300
into getting a job.

775
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,700
She's driving everyone crazy.

776
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,060
Same here.

777
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,060
My wife said she needed to
go back to her parental home.

778
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,940
She wants to learn from women of Huayuan

779
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,180
and wouldn't come back
if I don't wash her feet.

780
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,540
Come on. Shuo.

781
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,540
The two of us

782
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,300
haven't drunk together for a long time.

783
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,420
Let's drink till we drop today.

784
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,620
Here you are.

785
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,700
Qianqian,

786
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,700
Shuo told me

787
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,100
you often participated
in political affairs in Huayuan

788
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,820
and made lots of achievements.

789
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,500
What do you think

790
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,300
those guys should do

791
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,980
with their wives' problems?

792
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,700
I'd like to ask you

793
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
who manages household affairs in your family.

794
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,940
My wife.

795
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,260
Who brings up children?

796
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,620
My wife.

797
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,060
Who takes care of your parents?

798
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,860
My wife.

799
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,460
Have you ever thought about that?

800
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,340
Your wife is like

801
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
a servant that has to

802
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,620
take care of you,

803
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,500
your children and your parents.

804
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,700
It seems she stays at home
and doesn't need to work,

805
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,780
but actually,

806
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,100
she holds three posts simultaneously.

807
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,740
Everyone,

808
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,380
have you ever said to your wife,

809
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,980
"Thank you for what you've done.

810
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,340
What should I do without you?"

811
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,940
We've never said

812
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,220
those words

813
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,740
to our stewards, cooks or servants.

814
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,980
Do you mean

815
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,820
you just consider your wife

816
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,980
as your steward and servant?

817
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,340
Ridiculous. This is sophistry.

818
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,180
Young Master even washed her feet.

819
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,100
When all goes to all,

820
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,820
women can only do those things.

821
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,740
What else could they do?

822
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,700
No.

823
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,300
Women can do housework at home

824
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
and also handle political affairs

825
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,340
in court.

826
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,060
You're arrogant.

827
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,140
Let me test you.

828
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,940
According to census data
gathered by Ministry of Statistics,

829
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,140
the birth rate has been decreasing.

830
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,860
To figure out why...

831
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,380
It's because something has
changed about marriage, right?

832
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,460
Women began to divorce and remarry

833
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,100
and some even chose to always stay single,

834
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,620
which caused declining birth rates

835
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,060
and less young men.

836
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,420
Do you know why it happened?

837
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,940
Men in Xuanhu City consider
themselves always right

838
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
and make decisions

839
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,860
without asking their partners' opinions.

840
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,580
Bluntly, it's male chauvinism.

841
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,980
They want you to do everything as they say.

842
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,260
Nobody will love a man like that.

843
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,540
In my opinion,

844
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,260
it's you women that are making trouble.

845
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,820
Men of Xuanhu are handsome
and highly esteemed.

846
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,900
Nobody won't like us.

847
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,980
In the future, anyone aged 16 or above

848
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,260
will get a fine if they're single.

849
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
A fine?

850
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,740
Getting taxed for being single?

851
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,900
The problem is still unsolved in this case.

852
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,060
If it doesn't work,

853
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,900
then just imprison them.

854
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,020
Absurd.

855
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,100
Is the current situation caused

856
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,220
by women?

857
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,020
Obviously, it's caused by men.

858
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,740
Instead of thinking about

859
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,340
how to change men,

860
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,540
you blame everything on women.

861
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,860
Interesting.

862
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,900
In your opinion,

863
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,340
what to do?

864
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,780
Forget about it if you can't figure it out,

865
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,820
lest you waste our time.

866
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,220
Allow people of Xuanhu
to marry people of Huayuan.

867
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,780
Women are superior to men in Huayuan

868
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,460
and it's the opposite in Xuanhu.

869
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,180
The two cities have been irreconcilable
since ancient times.

870
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,540
How could such marriages be possible?

871
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,380
Now that Xuanhu and Huayuan
have been in a stalemate,

872
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,740
people in both cities have been influenced.

873
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,260
In the final analysis,
it's about cultural difference.

874
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,300
Take "tiger" as an example.

875
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,780
In Xuanhu City, it means
"mighty and powerful".

876
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,140
But in Huayuan City,

877
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,740
it means "silly, rash and mindless".

878
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,540
What did you say?

879
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,700
It began to mean "cute" in these years.

880
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,660
Internally, we can

881
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,260
ease the decline in births.

882
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,780
Externally, we can

883
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,220
resolve misunderstandings
between the two cities

884
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,900
caused by cultural difference

885
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,220
and also exchange resources.

886
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,980
Then, the common people
can live and work in peace.

887
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,020
They'll enjoy a good and prosperous life.

888
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,740
What do you think?

889
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,700
No man dares to marry a woman from Huayuan.

890
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,580
But your wives, daughters and sisters

891
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,100
want to marry men of Huayuan.

892
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,500
He's smooth-tongued.

893
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,060
He's strong and brave.

894
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,780
He's gentle and considerate.

895
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,460
He's handsome and stupid.

896
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,700
There are different kinds of men.
You name it.

897
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,540
Girls, do you want to marry them?

898
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,340
As the saying goes, a woman usurping
a man's power will destroy a family.

899
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,940
It's better that women
stay at home and don't work.

900
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,780
So much for today.

901
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,940
Father,

902
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,700
I think what Xiaoqian said

903
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,420
makes sense.

904
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,220
Hold your tongue.

905
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,940
I told you to get the mine.

906
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,740
What did you get?

907
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,100
Is she a mine?

908
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,540
Can she burn?

909
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,900
No. I can't.

910
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:59,540
(City Owner's Mansion)

911
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,900
Your Highness.

912
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,860
Please hand over your weapon.

913
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,900
These guys

914
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,460
don't seem to be the previous City Guards.

915
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,820
I heard the City Owner had heightened alert.

916
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,220
She selected generals and soldiers
herself to be guards.

917
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
Will she be wary of me all her life?

918
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,300
Your Highness.

919
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,620
It's not easy for the City Owner
to call you in.

920
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,180
You need to be very cautious

921
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,820
and persuade her to forgive you.

922
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,660
I know that.

923
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,260
Mother.

924
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,380
Explain it.

925
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,780
Mother, I don't know this guy at all.

926
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,820
He's confessed everything.

927
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,380
What else do you want to say?

928
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,340
Mother, please forgive
my momentary recklessness.

929
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,100
Momentary recklessness?

930
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,300
Asshole.

931
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,180
How can you be so ruthless?

932
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,740
Do you know?

933
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,620
Qianqian played dead and bid farewell to me

934
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,140
so that you can take her place.

935
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,940
She did that for me?

936
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,100
In your mind, she's right
no matter what she does.

937
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,020
She's always loyal and obedient.

938
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,300
Do you think

939
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,780
I'm that heartless

940
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,300
and ungrateful?

941
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,060
Aren't you?

942
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,660
Mother, you once told me,

943
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,420
to do something big,

944
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,220
we couldn't be swayed by emotions.

945
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,060
I just don't want you to
give yourself over to blind emotions.

946
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,180
I didn't want you to kill your family.

947
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,740
Chen Qianqian didn't die.

948
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,740
She's escaped to Xuanhu City.

949
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,540
Do I have to thank you

950
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,260
for letting her go?

951
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,060
I really didn't expect it.

952
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,540
I treated you as my biological daughter.

953
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,420
But in the end,

954
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,860
you want to kill my own daughter.

955
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,980
Do you mean

956
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,180
I'm not your daughter?

957
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,900
I treated the late Minister Pei
like my sister.

958
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,260
After she died at her post that year,

959
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,580
I took you to my mansion

960
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,700
considering you were too young
and nobody took care of you.

961
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,500
I ordered everyone to keep it a secret.

962
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,140
Unexpectedly,

963
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,260
you're so wildly ambitious and dangerous.

964
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,100
You sent guys to kill Qianqian

965
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,620
because you're afraid

966
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,980
she may come back to take your place.

967
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,460
But do you know?

968
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,900
I can issue an order now

969
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,660
to make you become Crown Princess

970
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,420
and even the new City Owner.

971
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,700
Then the whole Huayuan City will be yours.

972
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,980
But look at yourself.

973
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,700
Your virtues can't compare
with your position.

974
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,620
The common people in the city

975
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,180
and City Guards who
followed you over the years

976
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,580
don't want to listen to you.

977
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,420
Can you sleep without anxiety

978
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,100
if you succeed me?

979
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,740
How will you persuade me

980
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,420
to entrust the whole city to you?

981
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,180
You also let down the late Minister Pei.
