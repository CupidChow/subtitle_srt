00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,350
[Secret Investigation Unit]

4
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,900
Xiao Beiming,

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,479
I'm somewhat puzzled.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,870
With your intelligence and wit,

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,330
as Yesha,

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,130
why would you have
revealed yourself for a woman?

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,710
Bonds between people

10
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,350
are something you may never understand

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,150
in your whole life, Chief Zhuge.

12
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,570
All you can do now

13
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,420
is mock me.

14
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,170
Even if you showed up,

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,020
it won't help

16
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,660
with Zhong Xueman's case.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
If you can't find proof of her innocence,

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,060
even if she isn't executed today,

19
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,690
she'll be executed in autumn.

20
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,130
If she isn't executed in autumn,

21
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,060
she'll be executed come spring.

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,720
But what if I do have evidence?

23
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,100
You found any?

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,620
What makes Zhong Xueman

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,240
the only suspect in this case

26
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,970
is that she and Old Bug

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,329
were together at the Yaksha Temple,

28
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,010
and Old Bug was killed soon after.

29
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,060
Since no third person

30
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,410
was seen entering or leaving the scene,

31
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,570
she was deemed the killer.

32
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,180
Don't tell us

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,810
what we already know.

34
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,010
Tell me whether you've actually

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,970
found evidence of a third person

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,460
entering or leaving the Yaksha Temple.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,380
I haven't.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,060
At least you're honest.

39
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,340
Guards,

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,810
take these two to prison.

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,690
Yes!

42
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,860
Father, don't rush.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,060
Let him finish.

44
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,500
Chief Zhuge,

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,290
though there was

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,890
no third person at the scene,

47
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,780
the killer wasn't Zhong Xueman.

48
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,800
Nonsense!

49
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,380
Do you realize what you're saying?

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,250
If not Zhong Xueman,

51
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,940
are you suggesting
Old Bug committed suicide?

52
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,100
There was a killer,

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,060
but the killer

54
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,620
wasn't human.

55
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,290
Not human?

56
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,970
What, a ghost then?

57
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,590
It was the heavens.

58
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,940
What?

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,850
Are you saying

60
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,100
the heavens killed Old Bug?

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
It was lightning.

62
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,930
That's right.

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
It was lightning.

64
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,290
Around the time of his death,

65
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,020
there was a downpour
with thunder and lightning.

66
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,970
What killed Old Bug

67
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,340
was a lightning strike.

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,970
Utter nonsense.

69
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,570
Utter nonsense!

70
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,530
You don't have to believe me,

71
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,500
but the body doesn't lie.

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,500
Have a coroner examine it.

73
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
Bring over Old Bug's body.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,290
Yun.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,470
Father, let him do it.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,850
I want to see

77
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,500
what tricks he's gonna pull.

78
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,620
Bring it over.

79
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,530
Yes.

80
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,100
Chief Zhuge,

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,750
I'm no expert in autopsies.

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,580
Could Coroner Feng

83
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,730
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

84
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,860
do the examination?

85
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,580
Feng Qingzhuo.

86
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,900
Examine it carefully.

87
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,490
We must ensure…

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,460
fairness and clarity.

89
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,040
Yes, Chief.

90
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,490
There's a crack
running from the top of the skull

91
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,660
along the cranial suture
to the back of the head.

92
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,490
Swab the nasal cavity,

93
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,380
and you'll get charred brain fluid.

94
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,550
The iron object the deceased carried

95
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,220
is magnetized as well.

96
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,370
These signs

97
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,860
are characteristic of a lightning strike.

98
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,580
The body is so badly charred.

99
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,290
That's also caused
by the lightning strike?

100
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,930
Yes.

101
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,780
The deceased was a drunkard

102
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,020
and had drunk
a lot of alcohol before death.

103
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,230
Alcohol is flammable,

104
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,900
so the body was charred.

105
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,170
It was precisely
because of the severe charring

106
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,140
that the usual signs we rely on

107
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,530
to determine death by a lightning strike

108
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,659
were destroyed.

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,580
For example,

110
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,990
skin at the strike point would contract,

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,170
muscles would spasm,

112
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,050
and the chest, back, neck, and nape

113
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,340
would all show marks

114
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,700
resembling seal script.

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,760
None of them are present on this body.

116
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,290
And that's not all the evidence.

117
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,970
The Yaksha Temple
has been in disrepair for years,

118
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,370
and its roof has leaks.

119
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,580
I found

120
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,220
that directly above the body

121
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
is the largest hole in the roof,

122
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,490
and the weeds beside it

123
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,700
all show signs of recent burning.

124
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,700
All this proves

125
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,110
that Old Bug was killed by lightning.

126
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,410
Take the body away.

127
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,100
Yes.

128
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,490
Chief Zhuge.

129
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,580
If Old Bug was killed by lightning,

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,430
then that should be considered

131
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
an accidental death, right?

132
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,020
This means

133
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,490
we now have evidence

134
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,490
that Zhong Xueman is innocent.

135
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,170
Chief Zhuge,

136
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,050
can we release her now?

137
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,659
Release Zhong Xueman.

138
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,540
-Yes.
-Great.

139
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,490
Zhong Xueman's case

140
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,100
is closed here.

141
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,610
But Xiao Beiming,

142
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,460
I still need to look closely

143
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,170
into your case.

144
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,300
Guards,

145
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,820
take him to prison!

146
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,410
Yes.

147
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,260
No!

148
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,260
Zhong Xueman!

149
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Constable Zhong!

150
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,660
While you've cleared yourself of murder,

151
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,930
whether you've been

152
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,700
harboring a key criminal

153
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,290
is still unclear.

154
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,970
If you obstruct
the Secret Investigation Unit,

155
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,730
I don't mind

156
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,490
putting shackles back on you

157
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,050
and trying you together.

158
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,780
Take him away!

159
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,490
Yes.

160
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,190
An imperial decree!

161
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,100
Zhuge Tong and Zhuge Kongyun

162
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,040
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

163
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,340
Fang Tianzheng
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,260
heed the order!

165
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,610
His Majesty commands

166
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,460
the three of you
to enter the palace at once.

167
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,860
Where is Yesha, Xiao Beiming, now?

168
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,050
Your Majesty,

169
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,950
he's detained
at the Secret Investigation Unit.

170
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,020
Xiao Beiming

171
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,309
was wanted for three years

172
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,100
and had been nowhere to be seen.

173
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,370
Now he's suddenly

174
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
appeared in public.

175
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,490
Give me an explanation.

176
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,820
Give me an explanation!

177
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,340
Your Majesty,

178
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,710
I think he appeared

179
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,250
for the girl.

180
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,730
Xiao Beiming appeared
at the execution ground

181
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,610
to save Zhong Xueman.

182
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,970
Absurd!

183
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,620
Your Majesty,

184
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,130
as for why Xiao Beiming

185
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,420
suddenly appeared

186
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,550
and what he's after,

187
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,580
we'll know once we interrogate him.

188
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,460
Now that he's in custody,

189
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,720
which of your two units

190
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,970
will interrogate him?

191
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,770
Naturally…

192
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,770
Naturally, the Elite Constabulary Unit
should do it.

193
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,470
Zhuge Kongyun,

194
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
the Yesha case

195
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,370
has always been handled

196
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,370
by your Secret Investigation Unit,

197
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,300
and he is

198
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,010
also detained at your unit,

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,220
so why do you say

200
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,680
he should be interrogated
by the Elite Constabulary Unit?

201
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,300
I have my reasons

202
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,090
for making this suggestion.

203
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,890
Your Majesty,

204
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,700
Xiao Beiming and I

205
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,850
grew up together.

206
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,100
We've been
dealing with each other for years.

207
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,060
To be fair,

208
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,340
I have never bested him.

209
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,100
Moreover, Xiao Beiming

210
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,700
was formerly a constable
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

211
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,540
a man of great talent,

212
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,850
solving countless cases.

213
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,250
He knows normal punishments
and interrogation methods

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,220
better than anyone.

215
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,340
They're useless on him.

216
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,580
If he doesn't want to talk,

217
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,700
no amount of torture

218
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,850
will get even

219
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,050
half a word out of him.

220
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,940
And the Yesha case is not an ordinary one.

221
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,730
Several high-ranking officials
have been killed over the years,

222
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,850
along with civilians,

223
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,730
causing serious unrest.

224
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,130
Even with Xiao Beiming captured,

225
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,540
if we cannot uncover his schemes

226
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,010
and eliminate all his accomplices,

227
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,610
the Qi Kingdom

228
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,460
will remain in turmoil.

229
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,300
So are you saying

230
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,370
there's nothing we can do about him?

231
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:10,940
No.

232
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,300
Maybe one person could help.

233
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,890
Who?

234
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,870
Zhong Xueman.

235
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Why her?

236
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,010
Xiao had been hiding for three years,

237
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,730
and his sudden appearance today

238
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,300
must have something to do
with Zhong Xueman.

239
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,890
Whether he's still into her or not,

240
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,700
no one knows Xiao Beiming

241
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,250
better than Zhong Xueman.

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,250
will be handled

246
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,650
by your Elite Constabulary Unit.

247
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,540

248

There's something else?

251
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,970
Your Majesty,

252
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,060
the key criminal Huang Wuchang

253
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,460
escaped from my custody.

254
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,940
It was my dereliction of duty,

255
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,540
and my advice to my father

256
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,700
almost caused the wrongful execution

257
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,890
of Constable Zhong Xueman.

258
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,490
Although Xiao Beiming's appearance

259
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,010
has brought progress in the Yesha case,

260
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,100
I know my mistakes are unforgivable

261
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,610

262
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,100

263
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,420

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,850
He deserved such punishment!

383
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,780
-Chief.
-Chief.

384
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,400
Open the door.

385
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,850
Yes.

386
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
No need to open it.

387
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,980
Chief,

388
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,610
shall we send Young Master

389
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,930
back to his room to recover?

390
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,860
You dare defy His Majesty's order?

391
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,370
How did things

392
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,500
come to this point?

393
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,370
Chief Fang,

394
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,460
what would you like to know?

395
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,980
I practically watched you grow up.

396
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,270
All these years,

397
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,300
I've seen you solve case after case

398
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,210
and become the youngest elite constable

399
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,610
in all of the Qi Kingdom.

400
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,370
I never imagined

401
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,260
that you and I would meet

402
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,640
under these circumstances.

403
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,900
I didn't expect this either.

404
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,360
Maybe it's better.

405
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,690
When we worked together before,

406
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
we never had a chance

407
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,370
like today

408
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,690
to have a calm conversation.

409
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,300
I promise,

410
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,540
I'll tell you everything I know

411
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,820
and hold nothing back.

412
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,540
Good.

413
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,950
Then let me ask you—

414
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,170
are you,

415
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,940
or are you not, Yesha?

416
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,540
Young Master is awake.

417
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,450
Father,

418
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,500
are there many questions

419
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,130
you want to ask me?

420
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,690
I do have a lot of questions.

421
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,980
These past few days,

422
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,450
everything you've done

423
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,930
feels so unfamiliar to me,

424
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,610
as if I don't know you anymore.

425
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,300
Are you still my son?

426
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,890
Li Long,

427
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,330
help me up.

428
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,680
Okay.

429
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,650
Lie still.

430
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,690
The whole world believes I'm Yesha.

431
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,190
Why do you still ask that, Chief Fang?

432
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,650
I once believed this

433
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,300
without a doubt—

434
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,410
until you showed up

435
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,030
at the execution ground today.

436
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,300
By all logic,

437
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,630
the one who hates you most
in this world

438
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,690
should be Zhong Xueman.

439
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,060
After all, her father

440
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,890
died tragically on Fengbo Lake.

441
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
If she saw you,

442
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,740
even if she didn't cut you into pieces,

443
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,740
she would certainly do everything

444
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,020
to throw you in prison to face justice.

445
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,650
But instead, she…

446
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,740
And you—

447
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,690
if you were truly the evil Yesha,

448
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,540
with so many lives

449
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,060
lost at your hand,

450
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,580
as cold and merciless as you were,

451
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,500
how would you have revealed yourself

452
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,210
just for a woman?

453
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,450
There must be

454
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,500
more to it.

455
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,890
So,

456
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,650
you have second thoughts.

457
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,260
So,

458
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,410
are you, or aren't you?

459
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,820
Did you already know

460
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Xiao Beiming was in the capital?

461
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,210
It was just a feeling.

462
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,650
No proof.

463
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,210
But the word "feeling"

464
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,140
has already become taboo to you.

465
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I asked you to execute Zhong Xueman,

466
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,500
but it was a gamble.

467
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,980
I wasn't certain at all.

468
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,930
You won—

469
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,890
won against Xiao Beiming for once.

470
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,790
But what I don't understand is,

471
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,860
now that Xiao Beiming has shown up,

472
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,540
he should be under the control
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

473
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,170
That way, the Yesha case could be closed,

474
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,300
and our unit

475
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,260
would gain endless glory

476
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,540
and trample the Elite Constabulary Unit

477
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,300
completely underfoot.

478
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,020
Yet you handed Xiao Beiming over

479
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,820
to the Elite Constabulary Unit.

480
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,300
Father,

481
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,020
do you think what I said

482
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,820
to His Majesty in court
was just an excuse?

483
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,220
Whether I'm Yesha or not

484
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,000
must be proven with evidence.

485
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,850
Chief Fang,

486
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,780
for the past three years,

487
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
I've been searching for the truth.

488
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,650
I can tell you

489
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,170
everything I know.

490
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,960
As for whether I am Yesha or not,

491
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,100
you can judge for yourself.

492
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,690
Go ahead.

493
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,100
It all started

494
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,410
in a place

495
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,690
called Haiya

496
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,020
and with an army

497
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,370
called the Canfeng Army.

498
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,020
Why have I never heard of them?

499
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,260
A place that has disappeared

500
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,660
from the Qi Kingdom's map

501
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,370
and an army

502
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,370
that slaughtered countless civilians.

503
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,690
My master Zhong Yunchi

504
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,370
and General Huo Zongyao

505
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,650
both served in this army.

506
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,890
Actually,

507
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,710
I haven't really
won over Xiao Beiming this time.

508
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,650
What do you mean?

509
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,410
You forced him to appear,

510
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,340
which he certainly didn't expect.

511
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Xiao Beiming is no ordinary man.

512
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,340
If he dared show up
at the execution ground,

513
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,060
he must have had a backup plan.

514
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,610
He would never just surrender

515
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,940
and wait for execution.

516
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,660
If we couldn't get him to talk

517
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,660
and didn't dare execute him,

518
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,710
we'd be caught in a bind.

519
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,540
If he wouldn't confess,
we'd just execute him

520
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,850
and close the case.

521
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,580
I never found Haiya.

522
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,170
Everything I know about it

523
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,210
came from Yesha's subordinates.

524
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,450
Whether it existed

525
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
and whether that massacre truly happened

526
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,930
still need to be verified.

527
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,980
What about Yesha?

528
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,300
I suspect

529
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,520
he's an orphan from Haiya.

530
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,300
An orphan from Haiya?

531
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,930
The murder of high-ranking officials
three years ago

532
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,300
and the Fengbo Lake case—

533
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,930
both were Yesha's revenge.

534
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,500
Or rather,

535
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,740
the revenge of the Haiya orphans.

536
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,890
And this revenge

537
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,340
still hasn't stopped.

538
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,210
Do you have proof?

539
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,130
Before Old Bug died,

540
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,210
I was there.

541
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,340
He told me himself

542
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
that Yesha had ordered him

543
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,690
to make a certain pill—

544
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,340
one with immense power.

545
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,930
If it were successfully made,

546
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,390
the Qi Kingdom would fall.

547
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,780
Then investigate it.

548
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,670
No.

549
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,690
At least, you mustn't.

550
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,540
Why not?

551
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,740
Because this is a taboo

552
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,060
for the Qi Kingdom.

553
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,010
Unless you don't care about
your own life anymore.

554
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,100
I admit,

555
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,650
interrogating Xiao Beiming

556
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,580
will not go smoothly.

557
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,850
But even if we get nothing from him,

558
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,820
or he dies during interrogation,

559
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,890
closing the Yesha case

560
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,880
would only benefit
the Secret Investigation Unit.

561
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,890
What about the truth?

562
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,340
Isn't the truth what matters most?

563
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,020
The truth matters,

564
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,780
but it depends on

565
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,890
whose hands it's in.

566
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,780
If the Elite Constabulary Unit

567
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,890
discovers the truth,

568
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,300
then it's worthless—

569
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,010
even worse than having no truth at all.

570
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,650
So by your logic,

571
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,930
I can't keep investigating.

572
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,920
Huang Wuchang—

573
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,170
he should have seen Yesha.

574
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,890
Our top priority now

575
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,550
is to capture Huang Wuchang
as soon as possible.

576
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,540
The Qi Kingdom will fall.

577
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,060
The Qi Kingdom will fall.

578
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,580
What a bold claim.

579
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,650
If Xiao Beiming died

580
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,740
and Yesha's underlings struck again,

581
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,780
what should we do?

582
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,300
Kill them if they come.

583
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Leave none alive.

584
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,020
But would His Majesty

585
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,500
give us another chance?

586
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,260
Father,

587
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,190
passing this hot potato
to the Elite Constabulary Unit

588
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,410
is already

589
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,890
protecting ourselves.

590
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,690
Please trust me one more time.

591
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,610
This case

592
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,210
won't end so soon.

593
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,340
We'll have another chance.

594
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,300
You just stay here and rest well.

595
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,130
Reflect on your mistakes.

596
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,500
Since I've been handed over
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

597
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,410
my life is in your hands.

598
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,060
You now have three choices.

599
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,740
First,

600
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,060
declare me to be Yesha,

601
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,340
close the Yesha case,

602
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,930
and even execute me.

603
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,500
But if Yesha kills people again
in the future,

604
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,370
the consequences will be unimaginable,

605
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,300
and that may not be something

606
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,540
you can bear.

607
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,030
And the second?

608
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,190
Second,

609
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,850
keep me in custody for now

610
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,890
while the Elite Constabulary Unit
pursues Huang Wuchang.

611
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,450
But with your current capabilities,

612
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,890
whether you can catch him is uncertain.

613
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,890
This is a game,

614
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,170
a race against time.

615
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,130
What's at stake are countless lives,

616
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,210
even those of innocent civilians.

617
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,740
If we lose to time

618
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,450
or to Yesha,

619
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,610
either will be

620
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,100
a major disaster.

621
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,320
And the third?

622
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,930
Trust me.

623
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,460
Let me go capture Huang Wuchang.

624
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,280
Stop pacing in front of me.

625
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,170
Stop pacing in front of me!

626
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:12,980
Uncle,

627
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,890
you came.

628
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,340
Please sit.

629
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,580
Here, Uncle.

630
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,200
Chief,

631
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,900
Xiao Beiming is not Yesha.

632
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,450
I can stake my life on it.

633
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,300
So can I.

634
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,210
I can be a witness.

635
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,820
I can vouch for Beiming.

636
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,020
Stop calling him that.

637
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
He's a suspect.

638
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,280
What proof do you have?

639
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,930
Just your empty words?

640
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,170
To stake your lives on it?

641
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,020
Are your lives

642
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,820
even in your own hands right now?

643
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,060
Do you realize

644
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,660
how serious your crimes are?

645
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,740
Chief,

646
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,340
I admit I concealed

647
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,690
information about Xiao Beiming.

648
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,820
It was my idea

649
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,170
and had nothing to do with anyone else.

650
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,830
I'll take sole responsibility
for sheltering…

651
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,500
Xiao Beiming is indeed a key criminal,

652
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,580
but whether you sheltered him—

653
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,100
think that over.

654
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,340
Chief.

655
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,890
Fang Yin, write this down.

656
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,890
Constable Zhong,

657
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,550
upon learning of the whereabouts

658
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,440
of the key criminal Xiao Beiming,

659
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,170
immediately reported to me

660
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,400
and requested to make the arrest.

661
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,370
However, I believe

662
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Xiao Beiming is of great importance

663
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,060
and may be hiding

664
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,020
great secrets.

665
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,260
For the safety of the Qi Kingdom,

666
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,580
I assign Constable Zhong

667
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,740
to use her past ties
to get close to the key criminal,

668
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,580
gain his trust,

669
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,310
and obtain more intelligence.

670
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,300
Now,

671
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,980
Xiao Beiming

672
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,510
has been captured.

673
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,500
The mission to apprehend him

674
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,140
is officially complete.

675
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,300
I

676
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,130
will report your bravery and fearlessness

677
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,590
to the Ministry of Justice

678
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,340
and request commendations.

679
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,240
Fang Yin, have you written all that down?

680
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,060
Did you hear

681
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
what I just said?

682
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,980
Y-Yes,

683
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,340
but...

684
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,170
But what?

685
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,370
You want to disobey your chief's order?

686
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:24,980
I wouldn't dare.

687
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,040
I'll write it down.

688
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,570

00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,300
taking off your pants to fight a tiger—

762
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,930
reckless and shameless.

763
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,340
I can make a wisecrack too.

764
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,200
Fine, go ahead.

765
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,260
Madman, you must have

766
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,020
mistaken arsenic for candy today—

767
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,680
you've got a venomous tongue.

768
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,340
When did you learn

769
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,140
all these bizarre expressions?

770
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,370
I learned them at the escort agency.

771
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,300
Didn't learn much else,

772
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
just picked up these lines.

773
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,060
But, Madman,

774
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,980
you should learn from me in the future.

775
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,540
That way,

776
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,890
all young ladies

777
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:07,820
will like you.

778
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,940
What do you mean?

779
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,850
What do I mean?

780
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,890
Come on.

781
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,890
Let's celebrate

782
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,060
Beiming and Xueman's survival
through this ordeal.

783
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,710
-Come on.
-Come on.

784
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,100
Come on.

785
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,780
Cheers.

786
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,210
I never expected

787
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,500
Chief Fang to be so righteous
and sensible.

788
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,540
I was too harsh

789
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,370
on him before.

790
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,100
From now on,

791
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,830
I should show him more respect.

792
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,730
Actually, for us to get this far,

793
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,930
there's one more person we should thank.

794
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,400
Who is it?

795
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,090
Who?

796
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,170
Zhuge Kongyun.

797
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,820
Who? That sinister guy?

798
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,410
He's behind every bad thing

799
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,580
that's happened.

800
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,890
He and his father worked together

801
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,210
to frame Constable Zhong.

802
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:48,650
Beiming,

803
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,100
if you hadn't shown up in time,

804
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,370
we'd be mourning

805
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,300
at her grave right now.

806
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,340
Shut up.

807
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,820
I'm telling the truth.

808
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,930
That's true.

809
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,300
I used to think Zhuge Kongyun was

810
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,690
just a bad person.

811
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,640
Now I think

812
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,410
he's downright vicious.

813
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,370
Thankfully, His Majesty is wise

814
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,890
and let the Elite Constabulary Unit
take over.

815
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,540
If the Secret Investigation Unit
had taken you,

816
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,060
the consequences would be devastating.

817
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,860
His Majesty even gave

818
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,210
that playboy 30 strokes of the rod.

819
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,980
It served him right.

820
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Some things

821
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,570
might not be what you think.

822
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,630
That day in Weizhou,

823
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,280
when Zhuge Kongyun
approached the carriage,

824
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,159
he had already

825
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,469
noticed me,

826
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,310
maybe even earlier than that.

827
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,810
Get well soon.

828
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,460
Then why didn't he

829
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,790
arrest you at that time?

830
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,870
If he had made a move in Weizhou,

831
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,270
what would you have done?

832
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,020
If he had dared harm you,

833
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,810
I would have

834
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,100
taken his life.

835
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,730
He definitely

836
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,989
knew your intentions.

837
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,620
There are two reasons why he didn't act.

838
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,500
First,

839
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,130
he didn't want to see

840
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,330
the two units

841
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,190
turn on each other at that moment.

842
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,940
Second,

843
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,980
he had a question in his mind.

844
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,900
What question?

845
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,030
Why were you all

846
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,420
with me?

847
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,130
Zhuge Kongyun was never

848
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,580
a cruel man,

849
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,250
but he tried
to execute his junior sister in public.

850
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,250
He did that for one reason only—

851
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,980
to draw me out.

852
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,210
How horrible.

853
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,220
He's nothing but a despicable man.

854
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,170
It was an act of desperation.

855
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,810
His Majesty had given

856
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,540
him and his father

857
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,770
just three more days.

858
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,170
If they had failed to lure me out,

859
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,940
their lives

860
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,940
would have been forfeit.

861
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,690
So that makes it fine

862
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,380
to trade your life

863
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,420
for theirs?

864
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,900
Alright, calm down.

865
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,590
Aren't I safe and sound now?

866
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,100
Easy for you to say.

867
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,420
That's because you were

868
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,980
lucky enough to meet Chief Fang.

869
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,250
It was Zhuge Kongyun

870
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,840
who requested in court

871
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,720
for the Elite Constabulary Unit
to interrogate me.

872
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,610
Closing the Yesha case

873
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,460
would only benefit
the Secret Investigation Unit.

874
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,660
What about the truth?

875
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,660
Isn't the truth what matters most?

876
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,100
The two once-renowned elite constables

877
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,250
of the Qi Kingdom

878
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,460
have both used victims as bait
to draw out the killers

879
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,540
without the slightest scruple.

880
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,810
Even if the case

881
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,040
is solved that way, what's the point?

882
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,420
I never thought

883
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,650
that after all these years,

884
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,580
not only would you not have changed,

885
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,450
you'd have become even more despicable,

886
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,710
not even caring about the truth anymore!

887
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,610
Even so,

888
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,180
all he's done is just
made up for his mistakes.

889
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,210
That's precisely the problem.

890
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,500
You're willing to believe me,

891
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,650
stay by my side,

892
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,810
and protect me.

893
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,770
But in everyone else's eyes,

894
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,100
I am Yesha.

895
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:23,980
Zhuge Kongyun

896
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
was in charge of the Yesha case.

897
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,810
Even if he had killed me,

898
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,170
it'd be seen as justified.

899
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,630
So what mistake would there be
to make up for?

900
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,500
Are you saying

901
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,260
he also believes you're not Yesha?

902
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,580
At the very least, I'm now

903
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,860
reunited with you.

904
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,210
Zhuge Kongyun is

905
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,610
truly hard to read.

906
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,900
Not really.

907
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,420
Everything he's done

908
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,210
has been for one thing.

909
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,170
What's that?

910
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,500
The truth.

911
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,620
I've done everything I can.

912
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,500
Now,

913
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,850
it's your turn.

914
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,820
Right now, the top priority

915
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,860
is to find Huang Wuchang

916
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,940
as soon as possible.

917
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,650
But Chief Fang

918
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,460
only gave us permission
to see you at any time,

919
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,580
not to take you out for investigation.

920
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,380
That's fine.

921
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,740
I still have you.

922
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,860
So where do we

923
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
start our investigation?

924
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,810
We still need to start

925
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,580
with how Huang Wuchang was taken.

926
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,610
He was taken away

927
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,810
with poison.

928
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,290
But the escort route was top secret,

929
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,130
so how did anyone find out?

930
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,860
Zhuge Kongyun also suspected

931
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,940
there was a mole inside,

932
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,650
but he never found out who.

933
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,060
Even if there was a mole,

934
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,170
how did they learn about

935
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,900
the escort route?

936
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,420
First, we need to know

937
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,170
how that route was decided

938
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,500
and who knew about it.

939
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,380
As far as I know,

940
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,330
Zhuge Tong changed the route
at the last minute,

941
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,650
instead of taking the original road

942
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,940
from Weizhou back to the capital—

943
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,580
just to prevent leaks.

944
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
In that case,

945
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,940
only Zhuge Tong

946
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,800
and Zhuge Kongyun knew the route.

947
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,690
Zhuge Kongyun was in Weizhou at that time,

948
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,420
and Zhuge Tong was in the capital.

949
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,020
When they changed the route,

950
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,420
how did they pass along

951
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
the information?

952
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,860
It's during the transmission

953
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,320
that a leak is most likely.

954
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,100
Find out

955
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,900
their method of communication.

956
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
The Secret Investigation Unit

957
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,430
has its own way of sending messages.

958
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,490
We need to ask Zhuge Kongyun about it.

959
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,580
But he's currently locked up

960
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,290
in the Secret Investigation Unit's prison.

961
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,060
We need to find a way

962
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
to see him.
