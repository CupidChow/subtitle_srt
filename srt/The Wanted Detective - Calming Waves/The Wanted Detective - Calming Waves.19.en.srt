Mo Chong and Liu Feng came out

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,810
wrapped in one blanket together.

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,120
And just for that,

198
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,910
Dad made me

199
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,360
sweep the yard for a month.

200
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,630
While sweeping, you kept saying

201
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,980
you were going to catch snakes afterward.

202
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,960
They got so scared

203
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,410
that they snatched your broom right away.

204
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,510
The Elite Constabulary Unit

205
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,600
had never been so clean before.

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,480
You didn't even

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,210
break a sweat that whole month.

208
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
And that one time—

209
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,390
during the Spring Festival,

210
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,050
we were all making dumplings,

211
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,360
and you insisted on
adding surprises inside.

212
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,320
You filled one with spices

213
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,790
and said

214
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,550
whoever ate it

215
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,270
would have great luck in the coming year.

216
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,960
And then…

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
My dad ate it.

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,330
Master usually ate plain food,

219
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,320
and that one bite

220
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,870
made his face swell for days.

221
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,270
He didn't even dare show up
at morning court.

222
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,840
He said…

223
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,670
he said he was afraid
people would laugh

224
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,080
that the great King of Constables

225
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,910
had actually been poisoned.

226
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,740
L-Like you're one to talk.

227
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,390
You caused plenty of trouble too.

228
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,360
I still remember

229
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,030
when Chief Fang thought

230
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,030
you were too young

231
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
and didn't trust you.

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,260

We don't know what's happening inside.

287
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,500
We can't just keep waiting like this.

288
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,280
We need to find a way to get in and check.

289
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,720
But the guild's heavily guarded.

290
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,600
Every entrance has people on watch.

291
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,960
There are patrols in the West Courtyard

292
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,360
and guard dogs in the East Courtyard.

293
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,160
Which gate do we even go through?

294
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,850
Any little noise

295
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,910
and either the people

296
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,240
or the dogs will notice.

297
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,240
Then let's draw the people in the west

298
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360

The wine is amazing.

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,670
Really?

304
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,180
I must try it then.

305
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,870
Join me next time.

306
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
They're all sleeping so deeply.

307
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,670
Looks like everyone's food

308
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,790
was drugged.

309
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,240
What are you doing here?

310
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,750
Turn around.

311
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,150
Dairong.

312
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Where are you, Dairong?

313
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I've been looking everywhere for you.

314
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,440
Dairong.

315
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,320
Dairong.

316
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,600
Dairong, let me tell you something.

317
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,390
Dairong.

318
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,360
Actually,

319
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,020
I have feelings for you, Dairong.

320
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,390
Dairong.

321
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,240
Get away!

322
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
How did I end up here?

323
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,630
I was sleeping in bed.

324
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,630
You dragged me out here?

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,510
Why did you

326
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,790
bring me here?

327
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
That's nonsense!

328
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,240
My mom said

329
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,970
I've had sleepwalking issues
since I was little.

330
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,750
But I had taken my medicine

331
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,550
before bed.

332
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,080
Don't worry, though.

333
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,750
When I sleepwalk,

334
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,880
I don't hurt anyone.

335
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,870
I'm very strong,

336
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,150
and I worked so hard to get accepted.

337
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,510
Please don't kick me out.

338
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,150
I swear

339
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,870
I took the meds tonight.

340
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,960
How could I still be sleepwalking?

341
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,000
That was not possible.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,080
You have to believe me.

343
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I can't leave.

344
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
I really want to stay.

345
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Alright, enough!

346
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,860
Just go back to bed, okay?

347
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,390
Do you know

348
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,450
where your room is?

349
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,120
I do.

350
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,250
Then hurry up and go.

351
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,000
Get back to your room and sleep.

352
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,840
Will this plan work?

353
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,069
We won't know unless we try.

354
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,960
I think it will.

355
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
You look so delicate,

356
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,440
yet you're brave enough
to catch toads with me.

357
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,160
Aren't you scared?

358
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,310
Of course I am.

359
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,000
But I'm more worried about him.

360
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Hurry up.

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,550
Let's go.

362
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,350
What's going on?

363
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
The dogs won't stop barking.

364
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,920
Get everyone over here.

365
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,120
Search the East Courtyard thoroughly.

366
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,790
Your plan worked.

367
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,610
Let's go to the West Courtyard.

368
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,070
Madman?

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,060
Brute?

370
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,920
Why are you here?

371
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,880
I was worried about you.

372
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,880
We agreed you'd send word out

373
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,720
after you got in.

374
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,350
Why didn't you?

375
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:40,830
Can I count on you or not?

376
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,350
Look,

377
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,030
I wanted to send word out,

378
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
but they were watching me

379
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,350
way too closely.

380
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,610
They even watched me while I ate.

381
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,110
They also put

382
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,720
sedatives in our food.

383
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,240
I had to pretend I didn't know

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
and eat it anyway.

385
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,960
Once they lowered their guard,

386
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,110
I came out to investigate this courtyard.

387
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,070
Did you find anything suspicious?

388
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,910
A lot of things seem suspicious.

389
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,240
They care a lot

390
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,270
about physical strength.

391
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,400
Anyone who's strong

392
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,510
gets picked immediately.

393
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,830
The literary test is just for show.

394
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,720
You could recite classics wrong

395
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,240
and still get in.

396
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,200
And since we got here,

397
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
they've fed us well.

398
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
All those blood-nourishing tonics

399
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,590
have been provided to us.

400
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,440
Most importantly,

401
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,400
they don't allow us

402
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,350
to move freely around this courtyard.

403
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
So this "adopting sons" thing

404
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,640
is just a trap.

405
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,680
Told you—

406
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,790
they're after guys like me,

407
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,200
strong and built.

408
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,880
Whether you're filial or not

409
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,140
doesn't matter at all.

410
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,350
Listen.

411
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,550
There's a hidden room

412
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,240
at the back of the courtyard.

413
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,790
I smelled

414
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,310
a strong scent of blood there.

415
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,110
I suspect

416
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
that's where they use people

417
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,810
for their experiments.

418
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,310
The layout of this place

419
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,510
is incredibly complicated,

420
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,750
and the guards

421
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,830
are extremely vigilant.

422
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,750
There's definitely
something shady going on here.

423
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,160
But we can't alert them too soon.

424
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,510
You go back first.

425
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,590
Tomorrow morning, bring people

426
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,440
from the Weizhou Garrison

427
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,790
and surround the Salt Business Guild

428
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,920
to catch them red-handed.

429
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,450
Alright.

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,640
Wait.

431
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,790
The dogs have stopped barking.

432
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,480
I need to go.

433
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,440
Miss Huo is still waiting outside.

434
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,480
Miss Huo?

435
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,830
How could you let a defenseless girl

436
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,070
wait for you out there?

437
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,510
She's been worried sick about you.

438
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,550
I couldn't reassure her.

439
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,880
And she's not some defenseless girl.

440
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,310
Without her,

441
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,890
I wouldn't have gotten in here.

442
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,440
But...

443
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
No buts.

444
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
Don't be such a wimp.

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,790
Take care of yourself.

446
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,550
I'm leaving.

447
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,960
Promise me—

448
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
take good care of her.

449
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,790
I will.

450
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,440
I'll come pick you up tomorrow morning.

451
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,900
Then you two can be lovey-dovey
all you want.

452
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,640
How's Coroner Feng?

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,970
Don't worry. He's fine.

454
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
Madman found a lead.

455
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,570
We need to get help
from the Weizhou Garrison.

456
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,370
Let's go.

457
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,790
By the way,

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,640
he mentioned you just now.

459
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,680
He mentioned me?

460
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,830
What did he say?

461
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,000
Take a guess.

462
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,470
What do you think he said?

463
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,930
Are you scared?

464
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
Scared of dying,

465
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,550
or scared of dying before catching him?

466
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
Both.

467
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,770
I'm afraid they won't be able
to handle my death.

468
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,350
Especially Xueman.

469
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,480
Birth, aging, sickness, and death

470
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,880
are part of life,

471
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,440
and fear is only human.

472
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,230
Do you remember

473
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,710
the first time
we went out on a case together?

474
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,510
That serial murder case.

475
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,680
The killer caught me off guard

476
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,350
and charged straight
at your chest with a knife.

477
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,370
At that moment,

478
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,350
you were trembling with fear,

479
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,070
frozen in place.

480
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,960
You rushed to my side

481
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,000
and used your arm to block the knife.

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400
You didn't budge an inch.

483
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Covered in blood, you glared at him.

484
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,240
That outlaw was scared out of his wits.

485
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,640
In that brief moment,

486
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,730
we took him down together.

487
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
You blamed yourself so much afterward.

488
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,070
Do you remember

489
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
what I said to you then?

490
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,000
You said,

491
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,970
"No matter how evil a criminal is,

492
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,060
as long as you don't fear them,

493
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,570
they will fear you."

494
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,440
That's right.

495
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,400
No matter how deep the darkness,

496
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,510
as long as you have the courage
to open your eyes

497
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,640
and face it head-on,

498
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,110
wherever your gaze falls,

499
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,590
there will be light.

500
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,030
Don't fear

501
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,490
what hasn't happened yet.

502
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,000
Before the knife pierces you,

503
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,750
you still have work to do.

504
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,510
And don't forget—

505
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,750
you're not the only one

506
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,350
facing that knife.

507
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,200
Stop overthinking.

508
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,590
There's still so much

509
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,030
waiting for you to do.

511
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,550
Catch.

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,020
What are you doing?

515
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
I want to go
to the Salt Business Guild too.

516
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,070
Didn't we agree?

517
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,920
We're already on it.

518
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
I can't just leave everything

519
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,750
to you guys

520
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,640
and lie here in bed

521
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,590
doing nothing.

522
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,890
That'd be like waiting for death.

524
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,740
Mr. Wang?

525
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,880
Mr. Wang,

526
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,360
forgive me for not welcoming you properly.

527
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,110
Mr. Wang,

528
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,160
you've brought so many people

529
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
to my guild today.

530
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,350
What's this for?

531
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,790
We received a report
that the Salt Business Guild

532
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,550
is using the guise

533
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,630
[Salt Business Guild]

534
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,270
of adopting sons for rich merchants

535
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,370
to recruit young men,

536
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,920
only to secretly harm them

537
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,030
for your unspeakable purposes.

538
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,830
That's untrue.

539
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,130
It's a terrible misunderstanding,

540
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,740
Mr. Wang.

541
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,920
The guild merely acts

542
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,750
as a middleman

543
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,000
between both parties.

544
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,110
It's a charitable act for the public good.

545
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,040
There's nothing

546
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,750
underhanded going on here.

547
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,950
We'll find out once we search the place.

548
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,920
Fine.

549
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,920
Then please,

550
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,030
go in and look around.

551
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,160
After a thorough inspection,

552
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,350
the name of the Salt Business Guild

553
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,680
can be cleared.

Hurry up.

561
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,110
I'll say it again—

562
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,270
open the lock.

563
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,160
Mr. Wang, I really can't.

564

There's nothing worth seeing in there.

Just a filthy mess.

Why is there blood on the floor?

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,030
I... I...

574
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I can explain.

575
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,290
This place

576
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,440
used to be the guild's kitchen.

577
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,160
We've got

578
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,590
a lot of people to support

579
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,270
and a lot of mouths to feed.

580
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,680
So we used to kill livestock here

581
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,960
every day.

582
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,030
Over time,

583
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,040
the smell of blood built up.

584
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,270
Later,

585
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,750
an expert said

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,550
the resentment here was too strong.

587
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,070
Well? Is it human blood?

588
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,350
Human blood and animal blood

589
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,160
are difficult to distinguish once dried.

590
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,830
This man stays calm

591
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,240
as we raid the place.

592
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,770
He must have been prepared.

593
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,240
Oh, no.

594
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,390
Coroner Feng might be in danger.

595
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,770
Where are those adopted sons?

596
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,510
All well fed and taken care of.

597
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,240
Where are they? Take us to them.

598
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,240
Well...

599
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,970
Lead the way!

600
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,880
Okay, okay.

601
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,160
This way, Officers.

602
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,530
Why have we been summoned here?

603
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,340
What kind of test is this?

604
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,320
Don't tell me there's another test.

605
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,510
Just roll with the punches.

606
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,830
Does this mean we passed?

607
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,160
Alright, quiet down.

608
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,880
Officers,

609
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,510
all the adopted sons are here.

610
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,640
If you don't believe me,

611
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,110
you can ask them yourselves.

612
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,070
Aren't you all

613
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,110
eating well, drinking well,

614
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,070
and sleeping well here?

615
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,110
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,350
Yeah.

617
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,640
They say I plan to take your lives.

618
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,740
That makes no sense at all.

619
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,000
Exactly! We've been treated well

620
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,270
with good food and drinks.

621
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,350
Every meal is nourishing,

622
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
like nothing we've ever had before.

623
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,510
That's right.

624
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,920
We wear silk and sleep under satin.

625
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,230
Even the beds are soft and cozy.

626
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,270
Hold on. Someone's missing.

627
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,920
A friend of mine

628
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,350
passed the test yesterday.

629
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,240
I saw him come in with my own eyes.

630
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,640
Now he's gone.

631
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,590
Where have you hidden him?

632
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,400
-He's gone?
-He's gone?

633
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,350
Guess he left.

634
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,250
Come to think of it,

635
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,750
the fat guy next door to me

636
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,360
is missing too.

637
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah, it seems that fat guy is missing.

638
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,280
Officer, may I ask

639
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,110
what your friend's name is?

640
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,240
His name is Feng Qingzhuo. Where is he?

641
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,200
Mr. Feng?

642
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,400
You've got the wrong idea.

643
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,350
He changed his mind and left.

644
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,160
He left?

645
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,880
You're lying.

646
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,400
I saw him just last night.

647
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,510
I'm not lying.

648
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
He left just before you all arrived.

649
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,000
Besides, he's got two good legs.

650
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,400
If he wanted to leave,
I couldn't stop him.

651
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,960
Move aside.

652
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,160
Search every corner.

653
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,070
Beiming, why are you here?

654
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,750
Where's Coroner Feng?

655
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,400
Yes.

656
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,510
Mr. Wang,

657
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,960
how dare I lie to you?

658
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,160
You've searched everywhere.

659
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,350
Is Madman in danger?

660
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,830
Even if they were to harm him,

661
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,350
they wouldn't do it here.

662
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,750
Before men from the Weizhou Garrison came,

663
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,630
Tong Shuang was at the back gate,

664
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,510
and I was at the front.

665
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,160
Neither of us saw Coroner Feng leave.

666
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,310
After they arrived,

667
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,400
all doors were watched.

668
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,060
There's no way anyone got out.

669
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,160
Mr. Wang,

670
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,510
we're just

671
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,350
honest businessmen.

672
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,860
We'd never earn dirty money like that.

673
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,690
Tong Shuang,

674
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,010
before the soldiers arrived,

675
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,720
did you see

676
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,680
a firewood cart?

677
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,090
A firewood cart?

678
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,280
Yes.

679
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,030
But since it was

680
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,350
just carrying firewood,

681
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,750
I didn't think much of it.

682
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,790
Logically, a firewood cart

683
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,680
should be coming
into the guild from outside.

684
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,440
Why would there be

685
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,750
a fully loaded firewood cart

686
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,030
leaving the guild?

687
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,410
Coroner Feng was on that cart?

688
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,400
Xueman,

689
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,310
special times

690
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,040
call for special measures.

691
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,160
What a coincidence.

692
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
Sleepwalking again?

693
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,750
Can we trust the guild director?

694
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,750
He admitted Coroner Feng

695
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,940
was put in the firewood cart,

696
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,550
but it wasn't them

697
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,750
who loaded it.

698
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,510
He only knows
the general direction it went.

699
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,960
The Yellow Heaven is always cautious.

700
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
Every step is independent.

701
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,720
He was probably not lying.

702
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,510
Coroner Feng was alive

703
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,440
when he was taken.

704
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
We still have time.

705
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,570
What's going on?

706
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Why are we tied up?

707
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,550
We're not far

708
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,260
from death now.

709
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,880
Why is your hand bleeding?

710
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,130
I'm bleeding myself

711
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,480
to leave a trail.

712
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,200
It might save our lives.

713
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,080
What on earth is happening?

714
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,870
You wanna live?

715
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,960
Yes.

716
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,880
Right now,

717
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,480
you and I are in the same boat.

718
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,790
If I die,

719
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,790
you definitely won't survive.

720
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,980
If I survive,

721
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,670
I swear I'll get you out.

722
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,180
The Yellow Heaven wants to use our blood

723
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,110
to make pills.

724
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,720
If we catch them,

725
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,160
we'll be doing the world a favor.

726
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,730
Right now,

727
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,750
I'm leaving a blood trail

728
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,230
so my friends can find us.

729
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
Don't say anything.

730
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,260
Stay quiet.

731
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,750
Okay.

732
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,510
Okay, okay.

733
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,920
Beiming, there are so many paths.

734
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,000
How are we supposed to find him?

735
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,880
Let's split up.

736
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,200
I don't know how far we have to go.

737
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,420
If I run out of blood later,

738
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll use yours.

739
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,000
I... I...

740
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,980
Cut the crap. Shut up.

741
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
If I don't bleed you now,

742
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,480
they'll bleed you later,

743
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,880
and you won't survive it.

744
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,110
Fine, fine.

745
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,650
There's blood here!

746
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,980
Where?

747
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,150
Here.

748
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,820
Feng Qingzhuo left us a mark.

749
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,409
Is he going to be okay?

750
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
We need to hurry. He won't last long.

751
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Get up. Get up.

752
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,840
Move.

753
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,920
Don't you usually just bring blood?

754
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,000
Why did you bring two people today?

755
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,030
They got out of line

756
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,230
and almost ruined everything.

757
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,400
Why is this one injured?

758
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,360
He's bleeding a lot.

759
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
He got cut just now.

760
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,920
Such a waste of blood!

761
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,510
Alright, alright.

762
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,710
Drag them inside now.

763
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,240
Let's go.

764
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,320
He's passed out.

765
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,960
Move.

766
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,980
Don't fall asleep.

767
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,030
Don't fall asleep.

768
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,110
Sir,

769
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,290
what are you going to do?

770
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,480
You've already lost so much blood.

771
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,550
Might as well drain it all.

772
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,010
Come on.

773
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,850
Don't struggle.

774
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,110
The more you struggle,

775
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,030
the more it hurts.

776
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,030
Once your blood

777
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,670
is completely drained,

778
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,670
the pain will stop.

779
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
Sir,

780
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,550
is this dagger clean?

781
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,320
I'm a coroner.

782
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,480
Let me tell you,

783
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,760
if the dagger isn't clean,

784
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,290
my blood will easily spoil,

785
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
and once it spoils,

786
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,650
you won't be able to
make any pills with it.

787
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,590
Better now?

788
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,550
My clothes are so dirty.

789
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,670
This dagger

790
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,770
needs to be soaked in boiling water

791
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,380
or heated over a fire.

792
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,920
Why are you so picky?

793
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,070
Say one more word,

794
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,590
and I'll stab you dead.

795
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,840
No, no.

796
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,000
Do you know

797
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,760
why your boss told you

798
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,880
to bleed me

799
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,030
instead of killing me?

800
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,710
Because blood from the living is clean,

801
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,120
and blood from the dead is dirty.

802
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,920
The blood of the living

803
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,050
is not the same as the blood of the dead.

804
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,920
Shut up!

805
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,800
I can't shut up.

806
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,960
I have to tell you—

807
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,070
blood from the dead

808
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,230
carries countless illnesses

809
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,440
that will get into the pills.

810
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,190
The pills will become poisonous.

811
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,230
That's not good.

812
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,800
Those are filthy things.

813
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,550
Whoever takes the pills will be poisoned.

814
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,710
All your efforts will be wasted.

815
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,670
Poisoned!

816
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,860
With so much blood lost,

817
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,030
will Madman die?

818
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,100
He must still be alive.

819
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,740
Madman, hang in there.

820
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,840
As long as you don't die,

821
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
I swear I'll stop calling you Madman.

822
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,920
I can even call you Papa Feng!

823
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,400
Beiming,

824
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,180
can you hold on?

825
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Do you have a family?

826
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,630
Why did you work for the Yellow Heaven?

827
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,510
Do you know you've been brainwashed?

828
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,710
The Yellow Heaven has been lying.

829
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,730
I'm a coroner.

830
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
There's no such thing

831
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,190
as an immortality pill.

832
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,480
Let me tell you...

833
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,880
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

834
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,930
Shut up!

835
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,070
Holy Master.

836
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,030
It's all lies.

837
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,960
He's got a black mole

838
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,000
on the right side of his eye.

839
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,190
He has a black mole.

840
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,710
So you're

841
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,550
the Holy Master of the Yellow Heaven?

842
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,630
You can still talk?

843
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm Huang Wuchang.

844
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,440
Thank you for your contribution

845
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,840
to the Yellow Heaven.

846
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,870
After we ascend to immortality,

847
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
we'll make sure your next life

848
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,840
is full of wealth and glory.

849
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,670
You'll help me ascend?

850
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,070
You've done so many evil things.

851
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,840
You'll pay the price.

852
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
You are

853
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,850
a very interesting offering,

854
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,110
different

855
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,590
from the others.

856
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,800
Is the altar ready?

857
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,320
Yes.

858
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
It's right ahead.

859
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,730
The blood trail's gone.

860
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,000
These barrels

861
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,590
were used to hold blood and corpse oil.

862
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,550
He must be nearby.
