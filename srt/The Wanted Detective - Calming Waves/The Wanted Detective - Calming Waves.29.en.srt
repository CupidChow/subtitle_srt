[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,870
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,950
How is my brother?

4
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,450
He's probably been poisoned.

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,640
What kind of poison?

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I've never seen this poison before.

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,430
This poison is extremely potent.

8
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,360
It seems capable of
making one's vital essence boil.

9
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,990
Can this poison be cured?

10
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,840
Once a person's vital essence
starts boiling,

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,280
it may unleash their greatest potential

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,950
for a short time,

13
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,000
but the strain on the body
is overwhelming.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,280
Even martial artists
can barely withstand it,

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,800
let alone your brother,
who's just an ordinary man.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,750
His heart and all his meridians

17
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,800
have ruptured.

18
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,829
Even if we manage to save him,

19
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,920
I doubt he'll live for
more than a few days.

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,750
W-What do you mean?

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
Is my brother beyond saving?

22
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,110
What I can do now

23
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,800
is use my medical skills

24
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,360
to help him regain
as much clarity of mind as possible.

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
However...

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,430
However what?

27
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,430
In his current condition,

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
even if he wakes up,

29
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,640
he'll only last a few hours at most.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,820
Whether to proceed or not,

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,820
I can't make the decision for you.

32
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,430
Mr. Feng.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,850
Please use the needles.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,910
Are you sure?

35
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,750
At least let him

36
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,470
leave this world with dignity.

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,030
Don't blame yourself too much.

38
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,290
This isn't your fault.

39
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,000
Right now, I just regret

40
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,750
that back in Poison Valley,

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,100
I didn't study properly.

42
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Otherwise, I could have saved his life.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,820
You've already saved many lives.

44
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,840
Without you,

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
who knows how many times
we would have died?

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
That's right.

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,750
All the clues now

48
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,840
point to poison.

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,310
Without you,

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,690
we wouldn't feel confident
continuing the investigation either.

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,910
Luo Sen is awake.

52
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,280
Brother.

53
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,870
This is the person I told you about,

54
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,399
the one from the Qi Kingdom.

55
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:21,990
Brother...

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,430
I heard about your situation

57
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,920
from Luo Shu.

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,870
Thank you for being willing to save me

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,409
-and my family.
-Don't say that.

60
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,650
This is what we should do.

61
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,970
If you have any questions,

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,650
please go ahead.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,600
Mr. Luo.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,600
After you

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,960
arrived in the Lonely Town back then,

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
what did you do?

67
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,070
How did you get poisoned?

68
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,840
We just found

69
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,510
some supplies for the winter

70
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,040
in the Lonely Town,

71
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,070
and then we hurried back.

72
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,930
Other than that,

73
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,000
we didn't do anything.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Well,

75
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,830
on your journey,

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
did you encounter anything strange

77
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
or any suspicious people?

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,660
I have a deep impression

79
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,040
of a certain place.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
What place?

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,260
The Bei Hai Residence.

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,860
The Bei Hai Residence?

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,950
The elderly people here

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,430
survived the Haiya massacre.

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,590
When I was little,
I asked out of curiosity,

86
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,430
and the elders told me

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,860
that the soul-devouring monster

88
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,000
in Haiya

89
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
was released by someone

90
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,600
from the Qi Kingdom

91
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,040
named Bei Hai.

92
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,920
Beyond that,

93
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,040
they didn't know anything else.

94
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,240
But before they died,

95
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,110
they kept mentioning this name.

96
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,070
Mr. Luo,

97
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,310
do you know where that Bei Hai Residence

98
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,970
is located in the Lonely Town?

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,920
On the west...

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,750
Northwest slope.

101
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,000
On the first

102
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,680
small hill.

103
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,830
That place

104
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,270
looks somewhat remote.

105
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,370
Brother.

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
Shu.

107
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,310
-Shu.
-Brother...

108
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,360
What did Xing say?

109
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,600
He said

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,780
he hopes we can come back again.

111
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,480
I told him

112
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,150
we'll definitely come back.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Will the Qi Kingdom and Haiya

114
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
keep going like this?

115
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,600
Seeing Haiya become

116
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,910
like it is now,

117
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,670
I suddenly understand

118
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,790
why Yesha and the others

119
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,720
are so determined to seek revenge.

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,840
Because this is the only thing

121
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,320
they could do for Haiya.

122
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,240
Years ago, the Canfeng Army planted

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,790
a seed of hatred in Haiya.

124
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,240
And what Yesha did

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,150
was simply plant

126
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,910
another seed of hatred in the Qi Kingdom.

127
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,030
An eye for an eye.

128
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,390
We may not

129
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,390
have the ability to resolve hatred,

130
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,910
but what we can do is

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
stop more seeds

132
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,740
from taking root and growing,

133
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
at least

134
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,150
to prevent tragedies

135
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,870
from repeating themselves before our eyes.

136
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,270
Can we really do that?

137
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,200
When the truth

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,750
is revealed to the world,

139
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,270
whether it's the Qi Kingdom or Haiya,

140
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,320
good and evil will ultimately
find their rightful place.

141
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Justice is born from the human heart.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,460
Once there's compassion,

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
the outcome will change.

144
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,790
I believe

145
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,610
that day will definitely come.

146
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,600
That day will definitely come.

147
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,910
Before it gets dark,

148
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,790
let's pack up

149
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,320
and head to the Lonely Town.

150
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,270
My goodness.

151
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,200
If it weren't for case investigation,

152
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,330
I would never come to a place like this.

153
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,570
Everyone, stay safe.

154
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,390
Luo Sen said

155
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,270
the Bei Hai Residence is

156
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,870
in the deepest part of Haiya.

157
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,180
Let's split up and look around.

158
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,030
If I'm not mistaken,

159
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,960
this figurine must be

160
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,030
Bei Hai's wife.

161
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,000
Beiming.

162
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,390
I found

163
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,720
a really strange place.

164
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,870
This.

165
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,580
A blank tombstone?

166
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,230
Did you find anything?

167
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,440
We've looked around and found nothing.

168
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,770
We might have come here for nothing today.

169
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,120
Don't you find

170
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
this place somewhat odd?

171
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,600
It is odd.

172
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,720
Why is there

173
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,750
a blank tombstone in this courtyard?

174
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,360
It's not the tombstone that's odd,

175
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,820
but the courtyard itself.

176
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,720
Outside, weeds are everywhere,

177
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,870
but inside this courtyard,

178
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,400
there's not a single plant.

179
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,890
It is indeed desolate.

180
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,520
Be careful.

181
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,360
What kind of place is this anyway?

182
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,070
Looks quite old.

183
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
This definitely looks like a tomb.

184
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,290
Who would build a tomb

185
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,580
in their own backyard?

186
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,000
The character "upper?"

187
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,070
[Upper]

188
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,510
What does it mean?

189
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,400
Be careful, everyone.

190
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,790
I feel there's more

191
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,590
to this place than meets the eye.

192
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,390
Tong Shuang.

193
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,780
Let's go.

194
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,220
Careful.

195
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,440
This cave appears to be

196
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,670
naturally formed.

197
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,320
It's just been converted

198
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,960
into an underground chamber.

199
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,490
Looks more like a maze to me.

200
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,200
Be careful, everyone.

201
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,840
Okay.

202
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,510
The ground is slippery here.

203
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,150
Careful.

204
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,620
What kind of insect is this?

205
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,440
Never seen it before.

206
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Must be some kind of bug

207
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
unique to this cave.

208
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,670
I won't use this knife again.

209
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,320
Please throw it away for me, thanks.

210
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,850
Let's keep moving forward.

211
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,480
Here.

212
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,200
Thanks.

213
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,190
Danger!

214
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Run!

215
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
Feng Qingzhuo!

216
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,740
Throw some insect repellent!

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
-The repellent isn't working!
-Let's go!

218
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Run!

219
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,510
Quick!

220
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,360
Quick, light a fire and seal the entrance!

221
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,480
The bugs are coming out!

222
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,070
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

223
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,550
Run!

224
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,100
Run!

225
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,310
Dairong!

226
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,460
Catch her!

227
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,200
Watch out!

228
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,310
They're afraid of salt!

229
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,710
Quick, take out all the salt
you have on you!

230
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Here!

231
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,680
My Goodness.

232
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,590
We're finally safe.

233
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,000
You almost scared me to death.

234
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,130
You were risking your life back there.

235
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,680
It was nothing.

236
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,700
How are you feeling?

237
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,720
-I'm fine.
-Are you okay?

238
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm okay.

239
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,880
Just some scratches.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
They weren't poisonous.

241
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,680
Can I hold you a bit longer?

242
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,480
So dramatic.

243
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,780
Don't say that.

244
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,310
Let's go.

245
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
The character "middle."

246
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,080
[Middle]

247
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,060
The previous one was "Upper."

248
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
Seems there must be a "lower" somewhere.

249
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,240
So that means

250
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,830
this cave has at least three levels?

251
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,350
Wait,

252
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,790
who exactly is this Bei Hai?

253
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
The rocks in this cave

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,920
must have been here
for at least hundreds of years.

255
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,110
Bei Hai went to so much trouble

256
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,240
to build this place.

257
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,330
There must be something hidden here.

258
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,830
Those weird bugs we just saw

259
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,960
are the best protection for this level.

260
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,560
I wonder what else is in here.

261
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,490
[Middle]

262
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
The guards on this level are bugs.

263
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,340
What will the next level have?

264
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,310
Be careful.

265
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,310
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

266
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,790
This should be the only path here.

267
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,320
That must be the Lower Gate.

268
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,510
We don't know

269
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,640
when this bridge was built.

270
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,480
Be careful.

271
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,050
Let's cross one by one.

272
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,030
The bridge is safe for now.

273
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,030
Everyone be careful when crossing.

274
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,750
It's too dark in here.

275
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
I can't see anything at all.

276
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
Wait here for me.

277
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,210
I'll go ahead and check.

278
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,880
Be careful, Beiming.

279
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,350
Okay.

280
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,090
Tong Shuang, don't!

281
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,240
It's a trap mechanism!

282
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,880
Run!

283
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,550
-Run!
-Let's go!

284
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,270
Get back!

285
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,880
Quick! Get back!

286
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,590
We have to jump down.

287
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,720
The current is too strong.

288
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,550
If we jump in,
who knows where the water will carry us?

289
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,550
What should we do?

290
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,830
Jump over there!

291
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,000
Xueman, take Huo Dairong with you.

292
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,200
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

293
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,950
Everyone hold tight.

294
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,840
Tong Shuang!

295
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,000
Tong Shuang!

296
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,550
Are you okay?

297
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,550
I'm okay!

298
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,160
Beiming, are you okay?

299
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,510
Hang in there!

300
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,790
[Lower]

301
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,000
The Lower Gate.

302
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,030
Beiming, the Lower Gate!

303
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,090
[Lower]

304
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,140
Let's go.

305
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:20,960
Come on.

306
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,290
Why is it so cold in here?

307
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,960
This is all cold jade.

308
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,040
There's actually
such a large cold jade mine.

309
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,870
This won't do.

310
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,160
If we stay here any longer,

311
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,620
we'll all freeze to death.

312
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,640
The gate! It's closed!

313
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
Step aside. Let me try.

314
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,170
[Lower]

315
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,790
[Lower]

316
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,460
Xueman, stop wasting your internal energy.

317
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,640
There's a mechanism in this gate.

318
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,610
It seems Bei Hai

319
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,670
has no intention of letting us leave.

320
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,600
But we don't have any warm clothes.

321
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,310
We can at most hold out here for an hour.

322
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,440
Otherwise, we'll all freeze to death.

323
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,270
Don't panic.

324
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,160
I have a feeling that Bei Hai

325
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,750
is trying to tell us something
through this cave.

326
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,030
What do you mean?

327
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,150
If Bei Hai didn't want others

328
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,440
to find what he hid,

329
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,830
he wouldn't have set up three gates

330
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,310
in vertical order for guidance.

331
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,830
Whether it's the weird bugs
on the first level

332
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,090
or the sword statues on the second level,

333
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,070
it all looks like a death trap.

334
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,550
But now that I think about

335
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,920
how we managed to escape,

336
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
it was like Bei Hai

337
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,510
intentionally left us a way out.

338
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,840
Beiming, you're right.

339
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
There must be clues left

340
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
on this level as well.

341
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,550
As long as we find that way out,

342
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,830
we can escape.

343
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,750
While we still have strength,

344
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,310
let's split up and search.

345
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Alright.

346
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,510
Be careful.

347
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,010
Be careful.

348
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,240
Here,

349
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,160
warm up your hands.

350
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,480
Are you okay?

351
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,310
I've been poisoned by frost toxin before.

352
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,750
This bit of cold is nothing.

353
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,960
Found nothing?

354
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,890
Yeah, nothing.

355
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,490
Let's stay together for now.

356
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,710
It'll be a bit warmer.

357
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,050
What should we do?

358
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,960
Are we going to die here?

359
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,900
Xueman.

360
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,550
What is this?

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,830
This is...

362
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,880
Do you recognize it?

363
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,550
It's the symbol of Poison Valley.

364
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,480
Poison Valley?

365
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,790
Now I understand.

366
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,350
Everything makes sense now.

367
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,840
What do you understand?

368
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,110
Bei Hai is a disciple of Poison Valley.

369
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,030
I searched his pharmacy
on the upper level,

370
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,400
and in his medicine box, I found

371
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Poison Valley's gold needles.

372
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,830
Poison Valley's gold needles

373
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,070
are different from regular ones,

374
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,830
unique in size and dimensions.

375
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,030
At that time, just based on the needles,

376
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,290
I couldn't be certain.

377
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,070
Only when

378
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,350
I saw these symbols just now

379
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,000
did I become certain
that he is from Poison Valley.

380
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,720
What do these symbols

381
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
actually mean?

382
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,070
Medicinal herbs.

383
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,200
Poison Valley's formulas are top secret.

384
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,510
-To prevent leaks,
-Xueman.

385
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,550
all medicinal herbs in the valley

386
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,610
are represented by special symbols.

387
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,070
Even if outsiders see the prescriptions,

388
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,530
they won't understand
the specific contents.

389
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,480
Since he could understand these symbols,

390
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,200
it proves

391
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,330
he must be a disciple of Poison Valley.

392
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
But even if we know these symbols now

393
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,350
and that he's

394
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,550
from Poison Valley,

395
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,100
we still can't get out of here.

396
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,240
We can definitely get out,

397
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,500
because I understand now.

398
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,300
I understand his intention now.

399
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,000
You mean

400
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,920
you cracked the puzzle?

401
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,030
That's right.

402
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,440
As long as he's a disciple
of Poison Valley,

403
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,570
I can be certain that

404
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,160
where we are now

405
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,480
is not an ordinary cave,

406
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,160
but inside Bei Hai's body.

407
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,940
Inside Bei Hai's body?

408
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,370
What does that mean?

409
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,930
Tong Shuang.

410
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,640
Come on, stand here for me.

411
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,750
Stand here?

412
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,860
Let me explain.

413
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,960
The human body is divided into upper,

414
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,160
middle, and lower regions.

415
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,680
From head to heart is the upper region,

416
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,160
from heart to navel is the middle region,

417
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,650
and from navel to feet
is the lower region.

418
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,900
This corresponds exactly
to the three gates

419
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,240
we just passed through.

420
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,910
And the meaning of these three levels

421
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,400
precisely describes a disease.

422
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,120
[Upper][Middle][Lower]

423
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,960
The upper region feels like
being bitten by insects,

424
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,510
the middle region feels like
being stabbed by knives,

425
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,840
and the lower region...

426
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,920
Feels icy cold.

427
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,750
Yes, that's the condition.

428
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,960
Beiming, please.

429
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,200
Not it.

430
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,880
Not it.

431
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,000
Not it.

432
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,350
Still not it.

433
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,400
What exactly

434
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,810
causes this condition?

435
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,310
A poison.

436
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,750
It's the signature poison

437
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,550
of the previous Poison Valley Chief,

438
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,680
Separation Powder.

439
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,240
Is the Poison Valley Chief

440
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,480
the master of Unstoppable Old Man,

441
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,610
your grand-master?

442
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,000
How did Bei Hai know about it?

443
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,480
Perhaps because
Bei Hai was poisoned by it before.

444
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
I'm beginning to sense

445
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,960
his true identity.

446
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,440
But what we need to do right now

447
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,680
is find the exit.

448
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,350
And the way to break the deadlock here

449
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,590
might be hidden

450
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,880
in the floor tiles carved with symbols.

451
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,750
Constable Zhong.

452
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,880
You mean

453
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,920
we need to find the antidote
for the Separation Powder?

454
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,070
In the Yin-Yang Book

455
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,350
my master left me,

456
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,190
there's the antidote formula
for this poison.

457
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Two ingredients.

458
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,600
Just two ingredients left.

459
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,270
You can do it.

460
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,670
You definitely can.

461
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,270
Master.

462
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,510
May your spirit in heaven

463
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,480
bless us.

464
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,270
Could my judgment be wrong?

465
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,410
It's over there!

466
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,440
Over there!

467
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,270
Looks like this gate still won't open.

468
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,590
Are we going

469
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,350
to die here?

470
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,400
This...

471
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,030
This hole

472
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,350
looks somewhat familiar.

473
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,310
This is your dowry.

474
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,550
I've deposited all the deeds

475
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,750
to our lands and shops

476
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,680
in the bank.

477
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,590
This thumb ring is the token.

478
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,790
You can retrieve them

479
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,110
anytime you need.

480
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,650
He gave me this thumb ring yesterday,

481
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,480
saying it's my dowry.

482
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,750
But it sounded more like
a parting gift.

483
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,590
Master...

484
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,710
Let's go.

485
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,590
Be careful.
