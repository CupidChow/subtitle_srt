on a rainy day was because

But even with his lower body is paralyzed,

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
he stretched his arm to feed

00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Go arrest him.

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
Scholar Zhang did suffocate to death.

194
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
But it's not because of a lung disease,

195
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
but poison.

196
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,790
I found a bite mark of a rat

197
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,030
on his feet.

198
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,670
A rat?

199
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
It's no ordinary rat,

200
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
but a rare poisonous rat

201
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,630
called Blue-Eyed Silver Rat.

202
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,200
This rat's poison

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
can cause difficulty breathing

204
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,320
and eventually suffocate to death.

205
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
It looks just like a lung disease.

206
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,870
And this poison

207
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,430
cannot be detected with the usual methods.

208
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,360
We have to wait for a day and a night.

209
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,440
Jiang Yi.

210
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,320
Go back

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,750
and press a bun on the wound.

212
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,000
If the bun turns black,

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we can catch them.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,910
Arrest who?

215
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,630
The Blue-Eyed Silver Rat loves to eat
purple snakeberries.

216
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,630
In the whole Zhang Mansion,

217
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,200
only his wife's nails

218
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,030
were purple.

219
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,000
That rat should be

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,030
in an earthen pot in her room.

221
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,150
Be careful when you arrest her.

222
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,150
Don't get bitten.

223
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,340
I'll get going.

224
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,550
That courtesan case

225
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,240
caused quite a stir not long ago.

226
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Using the statement

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
from her neighbor Niu Lao'er,

228
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,400
I sketched out a potrait

229
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,080
of this thief.

230
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,510
Take a look.

231
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,270
Should we put up a

232
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,720
citywide manhunt notice?

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,620
You can put it up,
but there's no need for a search.

234
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,510
Why?

235
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,430
Because there is no such person.

236
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,440
The wound on the courtesan’s neck

237
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
didn’t have any outward-tearing flesh.

238
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,510
Yet the flesh atop the head

239
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,380
was torn and turned outward.

240
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,120
It means

241
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,270
she died of a head injury,

242
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,360
but someone disguised it as a throat slit.

243
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
There was a knife at the scene,

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,630
but there were no blood stains
at the point of impact.

245
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,690
If that's the case,

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,270
she didn't die at home.

247
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,790
Then who could be the murderer?

248
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,390
Since

249
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,720
the crime scene is fake,

250
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,200
the man who claimed to have seen

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
a robber entering a house and killing her,

252
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
and even saw the robber's true identity,

253
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,310
is also fake.

254
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,200
Niu Lao'er?

255
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,390
Put this sketch up.

256
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,230
When he sees it,

257
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,550
he will think that we believe him.

258
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,510
He will then let his guard down

259
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,200
to go and retrieve

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,700
the loot he had stolen and hidden away.

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,630
I'll go keep an eye on him

262
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,090
and catch him red-handed.

You've got herbal residue on
your sleeves and chest.

278

It should be from by decocting
and feeding medicine all night.

Normally, your mother

280

she must be sick.

Constable Xiao, you're right.

285
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
My mother has been
seriously ill these days.

286

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,270
is a three-day time limit

not rather

381
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,110
too rash a decision?

382
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,910
I'm not being rash, Your Majesty.

383
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,270
It's just that in three days,

I cannot afford any delays.

Thus,

This case is definitely
more complicated than it appears.

Three days

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,070
Come on.

567
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,830
Xueman.

568
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,510
Alright.

569
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,260
I was wrong.

570
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,310
I'll take you with me
to investigate, alright?

571
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,400
Now wipe those tears.

572
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,460
What kind of constable cries

573
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,240
on the job?

574
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,350
Gotcha!

575
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,350
You promised me.

576
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,050
It's a deal.

577
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,930
No backing out.

578
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
Zhong Xueman.

579
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,510
You...

580
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,340
Where are the blood tears?

581
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,950
Someone wiped them away.

582
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,160
Now how are we supposed to investigate?

583
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,430
Every crime has a motive.

584
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,480
There's definitely more to this
than it seems.

585
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Do you believe in ghosts?

586
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
My dad said,

587
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
tales of spirits and monsters
can't be trusted.

588
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,750
All the strange things in the world
come from what's in people's hearts.

589
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,440
Exactly.

590
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,470
Every crime has a motive.

591
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,240
Do you know what "Yesha"

592
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
means?

593
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,350
There's a folk tale that goes:

594
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,070
When someone dies
harboring deep resentment,

595
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,960
their soul cannot find rest
or reincarnate.

596
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,680
Instead, they become a vengeful spirit,
trapped among the living.

597
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,600
When that hatred
runs as deep as the ocean,

598
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,590
and their wrath fills the very heavens,

599
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,440
they are called Yesha.

600
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,030
It's said that Yesha claims lives

601
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,430
without leaving a trace.

602
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,030
Beiming,

603
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,340
you're better at solving cases

604
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,270
than I am,

605
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
but when it comes to popular stories
and legends,

606
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,110
I've read way more than you.

607
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,830
Besides,

608
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,810
Yesha killed several officials

609
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,200
but didn't take any valuables.

610
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,460
So it wasn't for money,

611
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,640
but for revenge.

612
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,000
Am I right?

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,070
Partially.

614
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I think everything Yesha

615
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,440
has done so far

616
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
was to spread rumors.

617
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,000
If it were just for revenge,

618
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,500
there was no need

619
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,920
to tamper with the statue.

620
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,550
He wants everyone to believe

621
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,590
that Yesha has come,

622
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,200
and the fall of the Qi Kingdom is near.

623
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
This person's ambitions

624
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,190
go far beyond

625
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,920
a few lives.

626
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,400
But he caused such a big mess.

627
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,410
Isn't he afraid that if he fails,

628
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,900
he'll fall into our hands?

629
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,130
Yesha prides himself on his cleverness,

630
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,030
thinking he's planned every move.

631
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,040
But there's one thing

632
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,300
he didn't account for.

633
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,160
What's that?

634
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,550
Me.

635
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
So is it him that's arrogant,

636
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,340
or you?

637
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,310
Don't worry.

638
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,590
I'll outwit him.

639
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,680
Let's go.

640
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,460
Go where?

641
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
It's already dark.

642
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Home, of course.

643
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,920
But we haven't found anything yet.

644
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
Even so, we need some rest.

645
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,740
Tomorrow morning,

646
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,000
we'll head to Mandarin Duck Restaurant.

647
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
For what?

648
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,830
Is there a case
at Mandarin Duck Restaurant too?

649
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,000
We're going there

650
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
to get someone her favorite treat,

651
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,140
the very first batch of
peach blossom pastries.

652
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,110
Xueman.

653
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,960
Forceps.

654
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Catch it.

655
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,670
[Yesha]

656
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
Mr. Shen,

657
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,680
even though you've been reassigned,

658
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:20,540
[Shen Mansion]

659
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,960
your safety must come first.

660
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
Please report to His Majesty

661
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,070
and stay in the capital for now.

662
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,480
Ridiculous!

663
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,590
If Yesha really wants to kill me,

664
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,400
how long can you guard me for?

665
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
One year?

666
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
Or ten years?

667
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Am I to live

668
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,710
my entire life

669
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,240
under your watch,

670
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
like one of

671
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,160
your prisoners?

672
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,110
Enough.

673
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
I am willing to devote my remaining years

674
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
to the good of the nation.

675
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,160
Tomorrow morning,

676
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,770
I must leave for my new post.

677
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,750
Mr. Shen.

678
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,750
Master.

679
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,680
Mr. Shen is right.

680
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,870
Keeping him here

681
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,200
won't change anything.

682
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,890
Beiming.

683
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,590
Master,

684
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,720
I have a plan

685
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,810
that can ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

686
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,310
Xiao Beiming ran

687
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
all over the city today,

688
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,310
but it was all just a blur.

689
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,640
What useful leads could he possibly find?

690
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,880
Even though His Majesty

691
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
assigned this case
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

692
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,550
we of the Secret Investigation Unit

693
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,270
must not stand idly by.

694
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,220
For years,

695
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,270
the Elite Constabulary Unit

696
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,920
has been outshining us.

697
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,800
If they crack this case,

698
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,030
our future

699
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,720
will be even bleaker.

700
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,000
You're right, Father.

701
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,210
This case is of great importance.

702
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,270
If we can solve it

703
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,240
before Xiao Beiming does,

704
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
His Majesty will surely reward us,

705
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,790
not punish us.

706
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,640
It's a golden opportunity.

707
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,650
We must seize it.

708
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,520
But since the case

709
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,730
has already been handed over
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

710
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,800
we can't

711
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,630
conduct an open investigation.

712
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,540
So how are we supposed to gather clues?

713
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,440
Why did you support

714
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,100
[Shen Mansion]

715
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,440
Mr. Shen's departure from the capital?

716
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,230
Once he's gone,

717
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,400
we won't be able to protect him.

718
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,650
Tomorrow is the third day.

719
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,520
If something happens,

720
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,650
we'll be in trouble.

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Of course I know that.

722
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Then you…
So you need to find Master as soon as possible

723
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,640
and stay at the Shen Mansion with them

724
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
to ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

725
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,310
Are you hiding something

726
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,790
from me?

727
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,730
Of course not.

728
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,830
By the way, Xueman,

729
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,360
do you have any money on you?

730
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,910
Since you're not telling me anything,

731
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,550
I won't give you any money.

732
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,060
It's not that I'm hiding it.

733
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,070
The time just isn't right yet.

734
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,390
I have something important to do,

735
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,370
and I'll explain everything
once I'm back, okay?

736
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:24,920
Beiming.

737
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,520
[Shen Mansion]

738
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,550
Fang Yin's in trouble at the gambling den.

739
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,810
Xueman, I really have to go.

740
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,070
I'll talk to you later.

741
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,620
Wait...

742
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,550
[Shen Mansion]

743
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,270
Money!

744
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,510
Don't move.

745
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,350
I will pay you back!

746
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,740
I swear in the name of

747
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,030
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

748
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,310
Let me go.

749
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
Your savior's here.

750
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,030
Beiming!

751
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,550
Beiming, help me!

752
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510
Zhuge is going to chop off my finger!

753
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,430
Spill it.

754
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,850
What scheme are you playing this time?

755
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,250
Your junior bet against me

756
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,310

757

Now he says he doesn't have the money.

758
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,760
By the rules of the gambling den,

759
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,530
he's got to chop off five fingers

760
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,530

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,720
Even if I sold
all of the Elite Constabulary Unit's land,

767
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
I still couldn't pay that back.

768
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,790
Five fingers for 500 taels?

769
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,360
That's a fair trade.

How could you say that?

773
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,270
My uncle is the deputy chief
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

779
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,540
How could your uncle

780

blame me for that?

781
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,000
Besides,

782
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,480
that's 500 taels.

783
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
Five fingers?

784
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,650
That's a bargain.

785
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
If I were Mr. Zhuge,

786
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,540
I'd take all ten.

This bastard

793
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,090
to cause us

794
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,830
trouble.

795
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,720
If he loses his hand,

796
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,270
he can't be a constable anymore.

797
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,750
That would save us a lot of headaches

what does that mean?

809

Is this a great act of mercy?

810
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
You're just using me
to eliminate your rival.

811
