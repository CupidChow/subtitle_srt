00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,290
regarding some details of the case
and the evidence.

193
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,380
Today, Constable Zhong and I

194
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,470
have invited you here

195
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,900
solely to seek your guidance

196
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,470
on the case.

197
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,890
Then what exactly do you want to ask me?

198
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,010
Director Blue Cat, you're straightforward.

199
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,210
Then, I'll be direct.

200
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,140
There  is a key criminal

201
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
named Huang Wuchang

202
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,650
who was rescued during transport.

203
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,850
We'd like to inquire about this matter.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,590
And what does that

205
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,550
have to do with me?

206
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,230
The carrier pigeons used
by the Secret Investigation Unit

207
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,630
come from your dovecote.

208
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,840
So, you're saying

209
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,390
that information was leaked

210
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,410
from my dovecote?

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,230
Of course,

212
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,860
we're not suspecting you,
Director Blue Cat.

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,850
We both know

214
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,750
that the dovecote is actually

215
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,070
[Nest of Returning Wings]

216
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,040
our country's intelligence agency.

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,020
And you are

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,320
the director of the agency.

219
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,890
Stealing secrets from the dovecote

220
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,490
would be nearly impossible.

221
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,480
But...

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,060
is there a chance that the pigeons

223
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,490
could be intercepted during delivery?

224
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,730
Chief Zhuge and his son

225
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
are no ordinary people.

226
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,230
They have their own

227
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,800
unique methods of sealing messages.

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,990
If the messages were opened midway,

229
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,190
do you think they would not notice?

230
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,430
Our pigeons

231
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,090
are specially trained.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,180
It would be very difficult

233
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,330
to tamper with them.

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,890
You're overthinking this.

235
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,950
I suggest that you

236
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,960
try a different approach
in your investigation.

237
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,540
This topic ends here.

238
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,690
I should go now.

239
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Director Blue Cat,

240
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,050
since you're already here,

241
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
why not dine here

242
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,750
before heading back?

243
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,960
I've told you everything I can.

244
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,380
The dovecote has strict rules.

245
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
My coming to the Elite Constabulary Unit

246
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
has already broken them,

247
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,120
and I've shown enough courtesy.

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Chief Fang, please understand.

249
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,220
I understand. I understand.

250
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,530
Director Blue Cat,

251
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,070
Huang Wuchang has committed
numerous crimes

252
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,370
and must be captured as soon as possible.

253
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,860
Please help us, Director Blue Cat.

254
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,600
This matter doesn't concern me.

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm only responsible for
gathering intelligence

256
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,040
and taking care of my pigeons.

257
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,190
Please wait.

258
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,390
Director Blue Cat,

259
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,790
I've heard some fascinating folk tales.

260
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,850
They say that in the eastern seas
of the Qi Kingdom,

261
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,470
there's a small island
with an ancient tribe

262
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,470
that has lived for generations

263
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,070
raising and training birds.

264
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,330
The thumbs of their people

265
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,350
are different from ordinary people's—

266
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,210
exceptionally long and slender.

267
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,870
Just now, I noticed that your thumb

268
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,270
exhibits the same trait.

269
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,710
Could the rumors be true?

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,330
That's not just a rumor.

271
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm indeed a member of
the Bird Tamer Tribe.

272
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,820
So the Bird Tamer Tribe really exists.

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
What about the Eastern Sea Kingdom?

274
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,930
They wanted our tribe

275
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,190
to become their spies,

276
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,940
working exclusively for them.

277
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,530
When we refused,

278
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,490
they slaughtered

279
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,140
our entire tribe.

280
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,110
I escaped by sheer luck

281
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,640
and fled to the Qi Kingdom,

282
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,570
where I've been living ever since.

283
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,700
I see.

284
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,840
Director Blue Cat,

285
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,780
may I ask how life is for you here

286
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180
in the Qi Kingdom?

287
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,340
Very well.

288
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
The imperial court has taken good care
of me,

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
and I have family and friends now.

290
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,190
Why do you ask?

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,460
Director Blue Cat,

292
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,660
Huang Wuchang is

293
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,810
a complete madman.

294
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,810
We've discovered
that he's been orchestrating

295
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,870
a massive conspiracy.

296
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,470
If his conspiracy succeeds,

297
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,090
countless people in the Qi Kingdom

298
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,280
will lose their homes and families.

299
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,650
The common people are innocent.

300
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,700
You've experienced loss,

301
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,670
so you must understand

302
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,070
that feeling of despair.

303
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,290
Director Blue Cat,

304
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,660
please, for the sake of

305
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
all the people of the Qi Kingdom,

306
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
help us.

307
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,330
Fine.

308
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,550
I admit

309
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,060
that I did keep something from you.

310
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,670
Actually,

311
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,690
the dovecote keeps a copy

312
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,820
of everything written on the messages

313
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,330
delivered by the pigeons.

314
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,510
In other words,

315
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,940
if I wish to,

316
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,680
I can know everything.

317
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,370
But didn't you say
that many pigeon messages

318
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,040
are sealed in special ways?

319
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,600
We have techniques passed down
through generations

320
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,930
that allow us to view
the contents of messages

321
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,460
without leaving any trace.

322
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,950
Don't misunderstand.

323
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,070
That's the Intelligence Agency's duty.

324
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,740
The monitoring is to

325
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
prevent greater disasters.

326
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,160
The imperial court permits this

327
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,940
because Director Blue Cat's loyalty

328
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,470
has been proven beyond doubt.

329
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,870
What I'm trying to say is,

330
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,890
although I've seen

331
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,120
the correspondence
between Chief Zhuge and his son,

332
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,680
I don't know the specific contents.

333
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,360
[Secret Letter]

334
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,480
Because they wrote in code,

335
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,770
which requires a codebook

336
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,180
to decipher.

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,230
You mean

338
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,950
the people who rescued Huang Wuchang

339
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,810
cracked the Zhuge family's code?

340
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,080
How is that possible?

341
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
Of course, it's possible.

342
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,150
Pigeon message intelligence holds value,

343
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,630
so naturally, there are people out there

344
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,810
who specialize in
collecting and decoding it.

345
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,630
It has even become

346
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,730
a business.

347
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,770
There's such a business?

348
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,770
Indeed, there is.

349
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,190
In the martial world, there are people
who collect

350
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,490
intelligence from pigeon messages—

351
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,890
they're called Book Merchants.

352
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,790
Then there are others

353
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,300
who decode the obtained intelligence

354
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,130
and transcribe it,

355
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,060
called Scribes.

356
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,980
Those who trade in intelligence are called
Book Collectors.

357
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,340
Chief Fang is right.

358
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,030
The people who rescued Huang Wuchang

359
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,870
must be connected to this group.

360
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,280
I've investigated them before.

361
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,590
They frequently appear around
Sibao Street.

362
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,350
Perhaps you could go there

363
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
and try your luck.

364
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,740
There is a copy of the correspondence

365
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,340
between Chief Zhuge and his son
in the dovecote.

366
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,360
I'll have someone deliver it to you later.

367
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,630
I hope it'll be helpful

368
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,060
for your investigation.

369
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,850
Thank you, Director Blue Cat.

370
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,140
Why are you all just standing there

371
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,310
doing nothing?

372
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,670
Hurry up and escort Director Blue Cat out.

373
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,880
Please.

374
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,130
For the sake of the people here,

375
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,700
I implore you

376
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,510
to ensure that Huang Wuchang is

377
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,640
brought to justice.

378
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,240
We will.

379
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,400
Also,

380
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,050

390
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,470

buy something from outside.

If we can't solve the Yesha case,

That's exactly the idea.

409
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,690
Once we translate it using the codebook,

410
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
it'll make sense.

411
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,680
So we still have to find the codebook.

is full of idiots?

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,740
Is it because you're old friends

568
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,950
that you'd bend the rules

569
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,080

570
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,160
Why can't you

571
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,650
wrap your head around this?

572
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,310
If Beiming were really Yesha,

573
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,170
would we need to ask for your help?

574
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,280
What evidence do you have

575
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,300
that he isn't Yesha?

576
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,450
Our chief said

577
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,120
that Xiao Beiming is
cunning and deceitful,

578
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,070
and everything he does

579
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,230
is just to throw people off the scent.

580
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,630
He has

581
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,940
ulterior motives!

582
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,190
If you show favoritism,

583
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,260
I will definitely

584
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,030
report this to His Majesty

585
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,760
and demand that you return him!

Please think it over again.

590
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,370
Our young master

591
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,280
has suffered greatly because of you.

592
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,680
And you expect me to help?

593
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,580
What a pipe dream.

594
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,420
He's such a blockhead.

595
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
Exactly.

596
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,660
If you ask me,

597
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,470
we should do what we did last time:

598
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,500
knock him out,

599
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,810
have Miss Huo disguise me,

600
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,860
and then infiltrate
the Secret Investigation Unit.

601
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,970
That's much easier than
begging that blockhead

602
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,970
for help.

603
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,460
I've checked.

604
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,610
Ever since last time,

605
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,020
they've been changing their passwords

606
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,130
and codes daily.

607
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,210
Even with disguises, we can't get in.

608
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,160
What should we do then?

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,920

We've walked up and down
this entire street,

613
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,260
but there's no "Book Merchant" anywhere.

614
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,320
Since these people

615
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,170
dare to sell the intelligence
from the dovecote,

616
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,920
they're certainly not to be
underestimated.

Since we haven't found
any aecondhand book stalls,

I think...

619
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,250
they must have disguised themselves

620
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,780
as other vendors.

621

How much are your sugar figurines?

627
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,670
Pre-made ones are 5 copper coins each,

You're good.

642
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,310
You could think of
asking a street vendor like him,

643
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,850
who's been selling goods on this street
year-round

644
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,950
and knows every stall

645

to ask about those things.

I think besides selling information,

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,380
they probably sell

this doesn't seem like your first time
buying forbidden books.

660
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,830

trading forbidden books

661

00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,350
for exercise every day.

756
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,550
Someone would scatter feed

757
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,600
near the dovecote

758
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,890
to lure the pigeons.

759
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,270
But those pigeons are quite smart.

760
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,320
They don't easily eat food from outside.

761
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,440
However, the bait we make

762
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,640
is very similar to

763
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,010
what they're fed at the dovecote.

764
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,870
Eventually, we managed to

765
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,110
lure them to eat it.

766
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,150
Over time,

767
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,830
those message-carrying pigeons

768
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,760
would fly off course to us instead.

769
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,270
That's how the contents

770
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,180
of the pigeon messages were leaked.

771
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,360
Have you recently intercepted

772
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,550
any intelligence
from the Secret Investigation Unit?

773
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,330
No!

774
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,680
I swear!

775
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,370
T-The information I have

776
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,410
is all outdated,

777
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,870
not worth much at all.

778
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,890
If I had intelligence

779
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,020
from the Secret Investigation Unit,

780
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,940
I wouldn't be

781
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,350
setting up a stall on Sibao Street, right?

782
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,520
Officers,

783
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,070
please stop looking at me like that.

784
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,990
In our line of work,

785
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,650
we can't just sell out others.

786
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,850
If I did that,

787
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,130
I'd be dead the moment I stepped outside!

788
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,830
Du Gouzi,

789
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,230
I'm giving you one last chance.

790
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,920
Will you talk or not?

791
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,780
I...

792
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,440
I won't talk.

793
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,400
I'm dead either way.

794
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,790
Dead if I leave, dead if I stay.

795
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,320
I-I choose to die here then.

796
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,820
-Come on. Do it. Come on.
-Come on.

797
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,410
Let's not waste any more words on him.
Come on.

798
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,190
-Come on.
-Hurry up, hurry up!

799
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,250
Give me a quick one!

800
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,780
I...

801
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,790
This is the lightest one.

802
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,880
Mine is pretty good too,

803
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,610
just a bit more severe than his.

804
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,540
If these two aren't enough,

805
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,660
there's another one over there.

806
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Let's begin.

807
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,960
Let's do it.

808
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,500
Wait! Wait.

809
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,720
I-I remember now.

810
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,090
I have something to say!

811
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,830
Since you've remembered,

812
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,490
stand up and tell us properly.

813
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,990
No need, no need.

814
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll say it on my knees.

815
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,800
Stand up.

816
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,540
Alright.

817
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,620
Well...

818
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,740
not long ago, I heard

819
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,640
that a Book Merchant

820
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,390
intercepted the intelligence
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

821
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,920
He's a veteran in our trade,

822
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,270
but I've only heard about him.

823
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,580
I've never met the man!

824
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,350
Where did he send the intelligence?

825
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,550
And who is the Scribe?

826
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,270
They say

827
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,870
he usually works as a Book Merchant

828
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,330
and also works as a Scribe.

829
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,680
He even knows how to interpret codes.

830
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
I figure

831
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,340
this person must be

832
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,240
personally in contact with

833
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,970
those Book Collectors higher up the chain.

834
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,090
He rarely buys information from others

835
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,230
and mostly does the scribing.

836
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,580
And the information he releases
is always related to

837
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,380
murder cases handled by the government.

838
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,550
So there's been

839
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,050
a rumor circulating outside

840
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,010
that this person

841
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,420
works in the Ministry of Justice.

842
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,490
Don't look at me like that, officers.

843
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,730
I... I really

844
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,520
don't know anything else.

845
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,320
I've told you everything I know.

846
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,830
Any news from outside?

847
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,760
What are Zhong Xueman
and the others doing?

848
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,130
No new information

849
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,150
has come through.

850
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,110
Young Master...

851
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,570
I've been wanting to ask you,

852
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,590
was it worth handing Xiao Beiming

853
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,330
over to the Elite Constabulary Unit

854
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,290
and putting yourself

855
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,500
in such a...

856
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,990
dire situation?

857
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,190
Of course it was.

858
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,690
But the Elite Constabulary Unit
and our Secret Investigation Unit

859
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,860
are sworn enemies after all.

860
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,450
Didn't you just

861
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,380
help the Elite Constabulary Unit?

862
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,100
Those pointless conflicts

863
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,350
are far less important

864
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,110
than human lives and the truth.

865
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
But Xiao Beiming is Yesha after all.

866
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,140
That hasn't been confirmed yet.

867
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,260
Haven't you been asking me

868
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,010
why, even though I discovered him

869
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,810
by Zhong Xueman's side long ago,

870
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,010
I delayed arresting him?

871
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,980
That's right.

872
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,220
His Majesty issued an edict long ago:

873
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,420
if we can't catch him,

874
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,010
both you and the Chief will be beheaded.

875
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,930
Why did you not only not arrest him

876
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,900
but also deliberately let him escape
several times?

877
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,810
Because in this world,

878
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,700
apart from Zhong Xueman,

879
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,670
the person who least wants him to be Yesha

880
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,100
might be me.

881
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,860
But...

882
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,820
but haven't you always

883
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,590
disliked Xiao Beiming, Young Master?

884
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,110
Yes.

885
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,110
I detest him.

886
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,310
I detest that he's smarter than me,

887
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,570
