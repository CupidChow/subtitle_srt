Where is he?

We didn't find him.

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,310
I saw him just yesterday,

10
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,310
but today he suddenly disappeared.

12
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,560

Fang Yin,

14
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,250
go ask around the unit

and find out which brother

last saw him.

to each city gate

22
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,360
if they've seen him leave the city.

23
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,030
If not,

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,030
station someone there to keep watch.

was this morning.

40
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,310
I asked

41
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,280
all the gate guards,

42
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,840
and none

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,030
saw him leave the city.

44
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
It hasn't even been a day.

45
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,080
He should still be in the city.

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,560
Fang Yin has been taking people

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000

There's no sign
of cooking at Jiang Yi's place.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,630
Looks like

51
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,190
he hasn't been back for days.

52
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,430
I also found
a Chronicle of Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea

53

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,270
I remember

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
he's a filial son.

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Three years ago,

59
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,120
his mother fell seriously ill.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Back then, King Zhong of Constables

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
asked all the men in the unit

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,790
to chip in for her treatment.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,270
I heard that all these years,

64
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,120
he's always kept his mother by his side

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
to care for her.

66
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,120

67
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,430
hid himself,

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,140
there's no way

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,250

71
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,830
There was no sign of cooking at his home.

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,190
His mother is old, sick,

73
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,430
and has trouble moving.

74
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,800
Lately,
there has been no one at his place,

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600

I knew you'd find me.

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,430
Since you appeared

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,480
and Chief Fang brought you back

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,280
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

83
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,830
I realized this

84
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,890
couldn't be kept secret anymore.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,240

Actually,

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
I wasn't trying to hide from you.

88
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,330
Why did you

89
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,060
leak the information to Yesha?

90
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,560
How could you do this

91
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,950
to the Elite Constabulary Unit?

92
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,810
How could you do this to my father?

93
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,510
If I hadn't been desperate,

94
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,900
I wouldn't have done it.

95
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm guilty.

96
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,950
Arrest me.

97
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,070
What exactly happened?

98
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,730
My mother was gravely ill.

99
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,750
Treatment...

100
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,070
costs money.

101
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,710
I used to work in the dovecote,

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,060
so I know how to decode.

103
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,420
So I started transcribing

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,540
to make a living.

105
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,690
I knew it was wrong.

106
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,560
That's why the books I sent out

107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,320
never involved anyone's life—

108
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:06,980
just so

109
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,420
I could ease my conscience.

110
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,980
Then why did you

111
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,460
cooperate with Huang Wuchang?

112
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,830
He's a serious criminal.

113
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,630
Yes,

114
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,980
he is a serious criminal,

115
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,100
but my mother's illness

116
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,390
kept getting worse—

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,340
she even started coughing up blood.

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,100
She couldn't sleep at night

119
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,510
because of the pain.

120
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,190
The doctor told me

121
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,040
the treatment
would cost 50 taels of silver.

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,190
If she didn't get help soon,

123
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,980
it would be too late.

124
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,070
You know better than anyone

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,630

126
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,230
a constable like me can make.

127
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,900
It was then

128
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,590
that Huang Wuchang's accomplices found me

129
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,150
and asked me to find out

130
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,710
his escort route.

131
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,950
I was really out of options.

132
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,950
For my mother,

133
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,409
I decided to take the risk.

134
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,680
Zhuge Tong tried to bribe me

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,340
to work for him
in the Secret Investigation Unit.

136
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,540
I played along,

137
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,230
pretending to defect to him,

138
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,300
tricked him into revealing information,

139
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,760
and figured out
which book was the codebook.

140
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,340
Then I used bait
to lure the carrier pigeon

141
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,540
and stole the letter.

142
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,950
Then I sold Huang Wuchang's escort route

143
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,540
to his accomplices.

144
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,100
Maybe I deserved it.

145
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,830
Although I got

146
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,070
the 50 taels,

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,030
I couldn't save my mother.

148
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,540
As a constable,

149
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,530
I broke the law knowingly.

150
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,010
I deserve whatever punishment I get.

151
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,540
How did you deal with

152
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,710
Huang Wuchang?

153
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,110
Where was it?

154
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,429
What did the contact look like?

155
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,870
Are you looking for me?

156
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,900
You...

157
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,060
You're Yesha?

158
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,690
How would he come to see you in person?

159
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,770
You're not worthy yet.

160
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,180
Did you bring

161
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,400
what I asked for?

162
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,780
This is the message route
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

163
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,820
I've already cracked

164
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,060
the code inside.

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,930
That's how it happened.

166
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,510
The person who contacted me

167
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,940
was one of his subordinates.

168
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,060
He was wearing a face cloth,

169
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,350
with a deep scar

170
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
on his forehead.

171
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,830
Also, he was wearing

172
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,780
a shell-shaped pendant

173
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,030
around his neck,

174
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,270
which was quite distinctive

175
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,270
and rare to see

176
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
in the capital.

177
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,110
That's all

178
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,870
I can tell you.

179
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,230

over the past few days,

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,110
I've watched you

184
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,170
save Xueman at the execution ground,

185
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,800
investigate the case,
and search for clues.

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,900
Each of you

187
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,190
has been full of drive.

188
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,060
And Beiming,

189
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,580
even though he was in prison

190
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
and shackled,

191
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,900
he still looked like

192
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,630
my spirited junior he once was.

193
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,350
It feels like all of you

194
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,270
have come back—

195
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,900
except for me,

196
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,270
Jiang Yi,

197
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,180
your senior brother...

198
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,470
I can't come back.

199
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,230
How cruel fate is.

200
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,540
Chief Fang,

201
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,700
I've failed you.

202
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
I've failed my brothers.

203
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm so sorry.

204
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,660
Zhong Xueman.

205
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,060
Chief Fang,

206
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,540
before I go, can I

207
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,510
kowtow to my mother one last time?

208
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,860
Yi!

209
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,400
Yi!

210
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,100
Yi!

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,720
Yi!

212
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,870
Don't touch him!

213
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,060
-Yi!
-Yi!

214
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,750
Tweezers!

215
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,750
This... this is...

216
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,670
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

217
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,820
Both the Old Bug and Yi

218
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,700
had these crystal stones on their bodies.

219
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,030
This is definitely no coincidence.

220
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,390
Could there really be

221
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,110
a technique

222
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,660
that kills with lightning?

223
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,820
If such a technique exists,

224
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
who would be behind it?

225
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,990
Why did they kill

226
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,510
the Old Bug and Jiang Yi?

227
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,630
Could it be Yesha,

228
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,960
trying to silence them?

229
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,660
Jiang Yi has seen

230
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,060
Huang Wuchang's subordinate,

231
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,700
so he might have been killed
for that reason.

232
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,780
But the Old Bug...

233
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,510
Yesha needed him alive to make elixirs.

234
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,710
Why would he kill him?

235
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,780
I thought of someone.

236
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,200
He's a bronze beast craftsman.

237
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,320
Maybe he knows

238
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,070
what these crystal stones are.

239
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,650
What's a bronze beast craftsman?

240
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,900
Have you seen

241
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
the bronze beasts

242
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,110
on temple and palace eaves?

243
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,750
Do you know

244
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,580
what they're for?

245
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,350
I read in a book before

246
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,300
that the tongue of a bronze beast
is made of metal

247
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,560
to attract lightning.

248
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,180
Inside, there's an iron pipe

249
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,510
that goes underground,

250
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,150
used to divert lightning
and prevent fires.

251
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,730
See?

252
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,150
Miss Huo is really smart.

253
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,990
As the name suggests,
bronze beast craftsmen

254
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,780
are artisans who make bronze beasts.

255
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,990
They're most knowledgeable

256
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,940
about lightning.

257
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,700
If you have questions
about lightning, ask them.

258
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,420
Jiang Yi said

259
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,030
Huang Wuchang has an accomplice

260
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,270
who wears a black robe and a veil,

261
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,470
has a scar on his face,

262
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
and wears

263
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,470
a uniquely shaped shell pendant
around his neck.

264
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,070
This should be a useful clue.

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,300
I know a place we can go.

266
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,380
I've already used that thing

267
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,510
to kill Jiang Yi.

268
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,380
My Lord, I've completed

269
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,310
the task you assigned to me.

270
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,580
You promised me

271
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,300
that once the task was done,

272
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,700
you'd spare me

273
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,420
and let me live peacefully with my wife
and daughter in the mountains.

274
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,780
But the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit

275
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,240
are still investigating.

276
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,270
If you go now

277
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,270
and get caught,

278
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,580
how can I trust

279
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,630
you won't leak information?

280
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,760
Only the dead keep secrets.

281
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,230
My Lord, spare me!

282
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,350
I won't say anything.

283
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,860
For your loyalty,

284
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,540
I won't kill you.

285
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,680
You'd better be smart about this.

286
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,270
Your wife and daughter's lives

287
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,540
are in your hands.

288
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,110
Master's elixir

289
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,900
is about to be ready.

290
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,750
We cannot fail this time.

291
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,270
Otherwise,

292
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,460
none of us will survive.

293
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,230
Yes.

294
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,540
Come on.

295
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,540
Who exactly are you

296
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
taking us to see?

297
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,510
Why so mysterious?

298
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,700
This person is Mr. Jiao.

299
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,900
He's a top expert
in casting bronze beasts.

300
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
He can cast different bronze beasts

301
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,140
based on the building's height and shape,

302
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,300
as well as
the surrounding climate conditions.

303
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,060
Buildings fitted with

304
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,390
his bronze beasts

305
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,530
have never been struck by lightning.

306
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,390
Even the imperial palace

307
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,650
invited him to cast their bronze beasts.

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,060
That's impressive.

309
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,900
Looks like we found the right person

310
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,940
this time.

311
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,900
Tong Shuang,

312
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,180
you look worried.

313
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,660
Getting help from Mr. Jiao

314
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,060
won't be easy, right?

315
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,450
You guessed it again.

316
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,540
But at this point,

317
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,380
he's our only option.

318
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,630
Let's go.

319
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,180
I've finished

320
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,660
all my orders this month.

321
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,180
I'm not taking any new orders.

322
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,820
Mr. Jiao,

323
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,750
how have you been lately?

324
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,270
Oh, it's Constable Tong.

325
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,750
Yes.

326
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,750
I brought two friends with me today.

327
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,660
We have something
we want you to take a look at.

328
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm surprised you came.

329
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,750
What is it?

330
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,540
This.

331
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,619
It's a rare thing.

332
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,510
Mr. Jiao,

333
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,910
just give us a straight answer.

334
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,819
Do you

335
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,839
know this thing?

336
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,339
When you first got it,

337
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,140
did you smell a sweet, sticky scent?

338
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,500
Mr. Jiao,

339
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,530
it seems we've come to the right person.

340
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,910
So what is this thing?

341
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,670
I can tell you

342
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,910
what it is,

343
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,380
but

344
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,840
you have to help me with something.

345
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,030
What is it?

346
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,640
Mr. Jiao, what happened to you?

347
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,750
A month ago,

348
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,540
while working,

349
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,580
I accidentally fell from a roof.

350
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,780
This iron needle pierced my skull.

351
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,620
It didn't damage my brain,

352
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,910
so I miraculously survived.

353
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
But the doctor said

354
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,060
it can't be pulled out

355
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,060
and that if it is, I'd certainly die.

356
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,910
I'm carrying this thing

357
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,510
in my head.

358
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,380
When it acts up,

359
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,430
I get splitting headaches

360
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,100
and have to
drink a lot of pain-relief wine

361
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,820
to ease the pain.

362
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,750
I've had enough.

363
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,580
I'm sick of this torment.

364
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,540
I've asked many doctors,

365
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,300
but none dared to remove it.

366
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,580
Aren't you curious

367
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,100
what that thing is?

368
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,780
As long as you remove it for me,

369
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,990
I'll tell you everything.

370
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,710
Other doctors didn't dare to pull it out.

371
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,190
How could we?

372
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
Madman, you're a doctor.

373
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,940
Talk some sense into him.

374
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,540
You know medicine?

375
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,190
Can you help me?

376
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,510
The risk is quite significant.

377
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,580
Then tell him

378
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,840
how confident you are.

379
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,710
Less than 50%.

380
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,860
Mr. Jiao,

381
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,230
I think leaving this thing in your head

382
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,340
is the safest option.

383
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,750
This thing isn't in your head!

384
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,850
Mr. Jiao, please clam down.

385
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,060
I can help you remove it.

386
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,620
Madman,

387
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,750
if you don't do it right,

388
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,080
we'll be the murderers.

389
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,040
Just go ahead and do it.

390
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,170
I won't hold you responsible.

391
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,750
I can write a will

392
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,570
to guarantee your innocence.

393
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
Aren't you curious

394
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,750
what this thing is?

395
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,190
You want my help,

396
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,470
so first you must help me with this.

397
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,670
Mr. Jiao,

398
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm doing this

399
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,540
not just for your help,

400
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,270
but out of a doctor's compassion.

401
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,580
We can't just stand by
and watch a patient suffer—

402
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,950
that's our responsibility.

403
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,910
Besides, with this in your head,

404
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,570
you don't have much time left.

405
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,230
This is very dangerous.

406
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,230
I need an answer from you:

407
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,520
shall I pull it out?

408
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,780
Yes!

409
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,670
Once I remove the iron piece

410
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,950
and insert the acupuncture needles,

411
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,540
you must immediately apply medicine
to stop the bleeding.

412
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,380
No delay.

413
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay.

414
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,380
Mr. Jiao,

415
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,710
think about

416
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,990
any regrets you have.

417
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,780
Here's a tip:

418
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,100
when you feel like you can't hold on,

419
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,620
think of your regrets

420
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,860
and you'll find the strength to survive.

421
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,030
I want

422
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,340
to go to the Zhengde Gate tower
to get some fresh air

423
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,270
because there's

424
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,380
a bronze beast there I made.

425
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,620
It's the best one

426
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,780
I've cast in years.

427
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
Constable Zhong.

428
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,380
Please take a look.

429
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,580
Speaking of shell products,

430
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,580
you've certainly come to the right person.

431
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,140
Throughout the entire capital,

432
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,670
only our shop

433
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,620
has these.

434
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,710
Manager Jin, are you so sure?

435
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,910
Of course.

436
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,750
You might not know,

437
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,030
but wearing shell-shaped jewelry

438
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,620
is a custom from the East Sea region,

439
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,230
symbolizing good luck and safety.

440
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,140
However, only craftsmen from Penglai

441
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,230
know the art

442
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,340
of processing shells.

443
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,300
In the entire capital,

444
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,750
only our shop

445
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,950
has such

446
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,450
a craftsman from Penglai.

447
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,930
Then please call him over.

448
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,910
I have some questions for him.

449
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,170
Of course, no problem.

450
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,140
Please make yourself comfortable.

451
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,910
Servants.

452
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,780
Mr. Jiao,

453
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,780
I've written down

454
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,990
the prescription and dosage

455
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,380
for this medicine.

456
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,190
You'll recover in half a month.

457
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,160
In six months,

458
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
you'll be as good as anyone else.

459
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,190
Then I'll tell you

460
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,190
what you

461
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,190
want to know.

462
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,190
As bronze beast craftsmen, we all know

463
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,860
there's a strange mountain

464
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,990
east of the capital.

465
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,640
It gets struck by lightning
whenever it's cloudy or rainy.

466
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,430
Over time,

467
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,750
we called it Mount Lightning.

468
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,510
I'm very curious about Mount Lightning

469
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,380
and often investigate it.

470
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
Later,

471
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,430
I found in an ancient book

472
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
a legend about a mysterious substance

473
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,140
that attracts lightning

474
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,670
when the weather is overcast and rainy.

475
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,380
And this substance

476
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,580
comes from Mount Lightning.

477
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,670
This legendary substance

478
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,030
is called thunder gold.

479
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,140
Although it's metal,

480
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,670
it's like grease.

481
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,820
It usually looks

482
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,060
no different from mercury.

483
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,030
But once it enters humans or animals,

484
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,270
it attracts lightning

485
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,290
during overcast, rainy weather.

486
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,060
After thunder gold is struck by lightning,

487
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,340
it produces

488
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,750
colorful crystals like the one

489
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,510
you just showed me,

490
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,670
which appear from the bodies of humans

491
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,760
or animals

492
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,990
and are accompanied by a sweet,
syrupy fragrance.

493
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,910
It's incredible

494
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,040
that such a magical substance exists.

495
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,300
Since thunder gold is so rare,

496
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,140
have you seen

497
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,430
anyone else use it?

498
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,510
The hunter from the mountain produce shop

499
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,140
asked me to craft a bronze beast

500
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,030
for him a month ago.

501
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,100
I happened

502
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,620
to find out he uses thunder gold
for hunting.

503
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,520
I never expected the legendary substance

504
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,820
to exist in reality.

505
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,270
Out of curiosity,

506
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,510
I asked him a few questions.

507
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,190
A month ago?

508
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,160
Could that be when you got injured?

509
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,950
The next day, while working,

510
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,950
I fell from the rooftop.

511
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,010
I'm afraid this wasn't an accident.

512
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,430
Someone must have wanted to kill you.

513
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,060
Kill me?

514
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,860
That hunter?

515
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,620
He seems very happy

516
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,780
with his wife and kid.

517
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,950
They are a happy family.

518
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,190
Why do you think

519
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,190
he would want to kill me?

520
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,580
You may know someone's face,
but not their heart.

521
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,620
Since thunder gold
can be used for hunting,

522
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,030
it can also be used to kill.

523
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,300
Besides, you saw him

524
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,230
using thunder gold while hunting.

525
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,950
Please take good care of yourself.

526
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,230
We'll go find him now.

527
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,470
Wait.

528
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,270
Remember,

529
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,340
if thunder gold enters your body,

530
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,620
do not go out on cloudy or rainy days.

531
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,140
Stay in a sealed room

532

533
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,470
and only leave once the thunder gold

534
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,710
has dissipated.

535
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,840
Thank you, Mr. Jiao.

536
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,910
Scarface?

537
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,670
Yes.

538
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,100
He was wearing a face veil,

539
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,780
with a deep scar

540
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,140
on his forehead.

541
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,710
I don't know him personally,

542
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,510
but from their accent,

543
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,670
he and his wife

544
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,030
are likely from my hometown.

545
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,710
His wife specially asked me

546
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,750
to make that shell ornament

547
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,190
you mentioned.

548
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,850
Do you know where he lives now?

549
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,620
I don't.

550
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,990
But judging by their clothes,

551
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,100
they seem to be hunters from the mountain.

552
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,910
Hunters?

553
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,470
Yes.

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,230
Be careful.

[Baofeng Mountain Produce Store]

577
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,140
People from the Elite Constabulary Unit

578
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,540
can't get here that fast.

579
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,750
Constable Zhong,

580
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,060
what should we do now?

581
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,390
No time to think.

582
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,200
Follow him.

583
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:19,990
Don't go.

584
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,540
Madman!

585
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,380
He has a plan.

586
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,380
Excuse me!

587
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,300
Sir.

588
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,060
What is it?

589
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,510
I got separated from my family.

590
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,670
This remote mountain forest

591
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,340
has no villages or shops nearby.

592
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,600
I was hoping you could help me
find my way.

593
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,580
Where are you headed?

594
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,620
I have a map here.

595
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,540
Could you kindly show me the way?

596
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,300
Sure.

597
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,060
I guess

where the Elite Constabulary Unit is,
right,

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,300
Coroner Feng?

601
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,910
Are you alright?

602
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,750
Are you okay?

603
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,620
After him!

604
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,140
He's hiding.

605
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,030
He's been hunting here for years

606
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,540
and knows the terrain well.

607
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,100
Just the two of us

608
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,960
won't find him.

609
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,540
Here's the plan:

610
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,710
I'll keep watch here.

611
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,750
You go get the brothers

612
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,140
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

613
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,470
to search the mountain.

614
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,670
Don't worry, he's not skilled in combat.

615
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,930
I can handle him alone.

616
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,580
Be careful.

Miss Huo just told me

620
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,290
Huang Wuchang might be hiding
on Mount Lightning.

621
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,030
The Elite Constabulary Unit

622
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,630
is gathering forces
to surround the mountain.

623
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
Mount Lightning?

624
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,580
Could this information be a trap?

625
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,440
Definitely not.

626
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,230
Why would they be so kind

627
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,710
as to share such important info

628
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,540
with us?

629
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,420
One good turn deserves another.

630
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,380
Right now, they are repaying us, I think.

631
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,710
So what should we do now?

632
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,930
Let me out immediately.

633
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,470
I need to report this to Chief.

634
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,030
But His Majesty's ordered that...

635
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,170
Who cares about the imperial order now?

636
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,860
If we delay any longer,

637
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,670
it'll be too late.

638
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,270
Hurry up.

639
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,310
Unlock it.

640
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,750
Chief, I've brought him here.

641
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,780
Still no sign of Tong Shuang?

642
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,710
A thick fog suddenly came up
on the mountain.

643
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,470
We've already sent several groups of men.

644
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,730
No one's come down yet—

645
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,060
not even Tong Shuang.

646
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,310
Does this mountain swallow people?

647
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,620
Uncle,

648
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,670
why don't we

649
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,880
wait for reinforcements now?

650
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,990
Once the City Guard arrives

651
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,860
and surrounds the mountain,

652
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm sure they'll come down.

653
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,950
Chief Fang,

654
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,640
Tong Shuang is still on the mountain.

655
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,620
The situation is critical.

656
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,860
We're running out of time.

657
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,780
Chief Fang,

658
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,130
let me go up to find him.

659
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,570
I'm willing to go too.

660
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,710
Me too.

661
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,020
I—I'll go too.

662
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,060
-Me too.
-Me too.

663
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,820
Me too!

664
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,410
I'll go too!

665
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,180
Me too!

666
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,860
Chief Fang.

667
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,480
Remember,

668
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,380
you must come back alive.

669
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,240
Let's go.

670
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,960
The fog is thick here.

671
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,910
Be careful.

672
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,910
Gather around me.

673
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

674
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,910
Tong Shuang should be just ahead.

675
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,110
Let's keep moving up.

676
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,700
Watch your step.

677
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,580
Be careful.

678
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,430
Is it taken care of?

679
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,580
Yes.

680
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,730
This idiot.

681
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,860
He was injured

682
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,460
and still dared to come here,

683
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,030
blindly bringing the constables.

684
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
He's more trouble than help.

685
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,910
Everyone,

686
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,620
why do I feel like

687
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,580
we've just been through

688
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,710
this place already?

689
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,130
Look!

690
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,410
Could there really be a ghost wall?

691
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,340
Don't be afraid.

692
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,480
We've reached the place.

693
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,030
What place?

694
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,320
Inside the formation.

695
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,590
The reason we got lost is that

696
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,540
there's a formation

697
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,620
on Mount Lightning.

698
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,330
A formation?

699
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,930
Do such things really exist?

700
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,430
They do.

701
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,340
Legend has it that a General
from the previous dynasty

702
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
used the terrain as a formation

703
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,430
to trap thousands of enemy troops there

704
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,030
for 10 days and nights.

705
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,230
The formation

706
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,030
is just using

707
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,270
the thick mountain fog

708
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,230
and surroundings

709
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,270
to deceive people.

710
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,750
So you've already...

711
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,580
Everyone, stick close to me.

712
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,190
Let's go.

713
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

714
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,100
Take this.

715
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,790
What is this?

716
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,469
You don't need to know.

717
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,870
You guys again?

718
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,870
Attack!

719
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,739

you've regained your martial skills.

Now it's my turn to protect you.

724
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,930
Kill them all!

Are you alright?

740
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm fine.

741
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,520
It's not like this is my first time.

742
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,700
You know

743
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,120
you can't do anything to me.

744
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,380
Once you're in
the Elite Constabulary Unit's prison,

745
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,170
you'll see.

746
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,740
It's not like
you haven't been there before.

747
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,180
I know you're not Yesha.

748
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,790
Who is the real Yesha?

749
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,510
Where is he?

750
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,100
Tell me,

751
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,880
and I'll guarantee your life.

752
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,910
Didn't you track him to Haiya?

753
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,790
Master is in Haiya.

754
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,260
If you've got the guts,

755
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,350
go to Haiya

756
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,580
and find him.

757
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,580
What's your name?

758

759

My name is Huang Liang.

760

Follow me from now on.

761
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,090
No one will bully you anymore.

762
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,950
