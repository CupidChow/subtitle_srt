Would you like some water?

Without you risking your life and bleeding
to mark the way,

we wouldn't have found Yellow Heaven.

129

As long as you caught him.

What did you say?

135
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,600
I said, Papa Feng.

136
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
It's all my fault.

137
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,150
It's all my fault for arriving too late

138
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,550
that you bled so much

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,150
and almost died.

140
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,670
But I made a vow

141
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,270
that as long as you survive this,

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,200

148
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,250
That's enough.

149
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,240
Let him have a good rest.

150
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,840
We'll step outside.

151
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,510
Go to sleep.

152
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,960
So you're Yesha.

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
What does Yesha

154
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,440
have to do with me?

155
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,080
You know Old Bug, don't you?

156
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,480
He told us

157
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,030
everything about you.

158
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,840
And who is Old Bug?

159
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,630
I don't know him.

160
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,080
Then explain to me

161
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,410
what the red crystal is all about.

162
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,270
If you don't know Old Bug,

163
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,440
how would you know

164
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,750
how to refine it?

165
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,720
Red crystal?

166
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,360
And what on earth is red crystal?

167
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,960
I'll ask you one last time,

168
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
where is Yesha?

169
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,270
Come closer.

170
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll whisper it to you.

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Yesha

172
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,510
is Xiao Beiming.

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,030
It's all Xiao Beiming's orders.

174
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,940
Everyone under heaven knows that

175
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,910
Yesha is Xiao Beiming.

176
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,240
I am indeed Xiao Beiming's subordinate.

177
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,510
All my actions,

178
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,670
as well as
the entire Yellow Heaven's actions,

179
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,750
are all under Xiao Beiming's orders.

180
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,150
You asked me to tell you,

181
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,510
and I told you honestly,

182
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,470
but you wouldn't believe me.

183
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,490
Why is that?

184
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,510
You killed so many people

185
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,270
just to refine red crystal.

186
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,550
What was it all for?

187
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,850
Nothing special.

188
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,150
Just a personal preference.

189
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,650
What do you mean?

190
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,390
I mean

191
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,600
it was for fun.

192
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,360
Do you know

193
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,150
what the most pleasant sound

194
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,150
in this world is?

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,150
It's the sound a person makes
right before they die.

196
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,720
It's truly delightful.

197
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,280
From the begging

198
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,850
and pleading at the start,

199
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
to the crying

200
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,270
screaming,

201
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,750
and then finally

202
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,270
growing weaker

203
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,480
and weaker,

204
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,080
until there's no sound at all.

205
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,150
It's like hundreds of ants

206
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,840
crawling all over your body.

207
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,270
Truly beautiful.

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,630
Whether it's red crystal or not,

209
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,480
it doesn't matter to me.

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,670
What matters is

211
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,320
I enjoy watching them suffer.

212
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,080
Bad news.

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Urgent message
from the Ministry of Justice.

214
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,320
We must escort Huang Wuchang
back to the capital for trial immediately.

215
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,960
You're awake.

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,090
How are you feeling?

217
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,080
Miss Huo.

218
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,630
Don't worry.

219
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,010
With my prescription,

220
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,750
I could even bring back someone

221
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,480
who's halfway in the grave.

222
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,730
Alright, alright.

223
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,230
You're the greatest.

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,120
Don't move around.

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,450
I'll get your medicine.

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,030
Where's Beiming?

227
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,750
How is he?

228
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,840
Is he alright?

229
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,720
He's alright.

230
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,700
I know what you're worried about.

231
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,520
But you've lost too much blood,

232
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,670
and your wounds haven't healed yet.

233
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,450
You need to take care of yourself first

234
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,150
before you can help him, right?

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,810
Don't move. Stay still.

236
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,910
No big deal.

237
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,790
I've just been lying down

238
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,960
for too long

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
and wanted to sit up for a bit.

240
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,270
Thanks.

241
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,270
Be careful.

242
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,120
I can manage on my own.

243
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,790
Don't move.

244
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Here.

245
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Miss Huo.

246
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,840
I...

247
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,480
What I wanted to say is that...

248
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm deeply grateful for your kindness

249
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,270
and will never forget it.

250
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,960
Is gratitude all

251
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
you have to say to me?

252
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,030
No.

253
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,880
That's not what I meant.

254
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Actually, I wanted to say...

255
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,550
T-Thanks.

256
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,720
You were actually a sweeter talker

257
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,250
when you were unconscious.

258
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,360
Unconscious?

259
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,150
What did I say when I was unconscious?

260
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,030
Nothing much,

261
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,370
just that you're a coward.

262
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,510
A coward?

263
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,060
Take your medicine first.

264
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,819
The Ministry of Justice has sent orders

265
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,220
to the Weizhou Garrison.

266
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,839
Wang Feihu will send people to escort you.

267
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,510
Your condition can't wait any longer.

268
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,589
You must go back quickly

269
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,720
and find Old Bug.

270
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,970
I can still tough it out.

271
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,880
Is Huang Wuchang still

272
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,960
not talking?

273
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
I've tried everything.

274
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
But fortunately,

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,960
although he identified

276
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Xiao Beiming as Yesha,

277
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
he didn't recognize you.

278
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,510
Now that he's been captured,

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,750
once we return to the capital,

280
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,440
we'll find a way

281
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,510
to make him talk.

282
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,640
Whether Huang Wuchang is Yesha

283
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,030
still needs to be verified.

284
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,030
They previously refined
a large amount of red crystal,

285
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,880
and we still don't know
what they used it for.

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,480
There are still many

287
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,240
Yellow Heaven remnants at large.

288
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,910
I'm afraid this matter

289
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,570
won't be resolved so quickly.

290
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll have the Weizhou Garrison
closely monitor

291
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,510
the movements of
the Yellow Heaven remnants

292
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,350
and report immediately
if there's any news.

293
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,720
We're the ones who caught him.

294
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,440
As long as I convince
the Ministry of Justice after we return

295
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,070
to let me interrogate Huang Wuchang,

296
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,330
everything will still be under control.

297
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,550
That's not right.

298
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,480
What's wrong?

299
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Huang Wuchang is of great significance.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,790
Wang Feihu would definitely

301
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,200
report it to the Ministry of Justice.

302
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,440
But the Ministry of Justice's response

303
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,510
came too quickly.

304
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,830
The round trip

305
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,570
would take at least two or three days.

306
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,200
Why did we receive
the Ministry of Justice's orders

307
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,400
right after we started interrogating?

308
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,530
Before we made the arrest,

309
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
someone had already guessed the outcome

310
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
and reported it
to the Ministry of Justice.

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,680
How is that possible?

312
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,310
Looks like trouble has come sooner
than expected.

313
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,160
Don't worry.

314
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,480
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

315
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,610
We'll set off early tomorrow morning.

316
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,440
We're escorting a key criminal,

317
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
so everyone, stay alert!

318
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,750
Constable Zhong.

319
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,400
The distance from Weizhou to the capital

320
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
is quite long.

321
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,110
I can only

322
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,290
escort you this far.

323
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,510
Thank you for your help and care

324
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,960
these past few days, Constable Wang.

325
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,070
No need to thank me.

326
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,770
It's just what I should do.

327
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,510
But there's something I wanted to...

328
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,440
Constable Wang.

329
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,070
We've fought side by side,

330
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
so just speak freely.

331
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
In the case of eliminating Yellow Heaven,

332
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,310
the Elite Constabulary Unit
deserves the main credit,

333
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,870
but my men of the Weizhou Garrison

334
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,870
also contributed their fair share.

335
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,310
Some of my men

336
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,750
are still recovering from their wounds
at home.

337
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,550
I wonder

338
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,020
if, when you return to the capital

339
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,070
and meet the officials
at the Ministry of Justice,

340
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,370
you could put in a good word

341
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,970
for my men, Constable Zhong?

342
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
Of course I will.

343
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,050
If it weren't for you, Constable Wang,

344
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,640
and your men arriving in time,

345
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
let alone capturing Huang Wuchang,

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,720
we all

347
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,200
would have lost our lives.

348
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,970
Thanks a lot, Constable Zhong.

349
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,270
So,

350
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,160
as for the favor I asked of you,
Constable Wang...

351
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,070
Please rest assured.

352
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,310
Whenever I come across
any remnants of Yellow Heaven,

353
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll arrest

354
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,560
every single one of them.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
My Lord, someone's blocking our way.

356
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,210
Who would dare to block our way?

357
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,240
Could it be the remnants of Yellow Heaven?

358
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,170
They look like government troops.

359
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,830
Aren't we government troops ourselves?

360
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
No, it's not that.

361
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,050
Those people are...

362
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,160
Zhuge Kongyun?

363
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

364
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm here under orders

365
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,530
to escort the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang, back to the capital.

366
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,540
Young Master.

367
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,790
Coroner Feng's signing up as a sworn son?

368
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,050
What's this all about?

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,750
Do you want me to disguise myself
and sneak in

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,640
to check it out?

371
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,960
No need.

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
Go send a secret message to the unit

373
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,130
and request additional manpower.

374
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,260
Yes, Young Master.

375
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Xiao Beiming.

376
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,510
The game has begun.

377
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,310
Zhuge Kongyun.

378
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
The Yellow Heaven cult

379
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,880
was eliminated by
our Elite Constabulary Unit,

380
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,860
and their leader Huang Wuchang

381
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,920
was captured by us.

382
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,350
Weizhou is not the capital,

383
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
and this is not a major case,
so there's no need

384
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,750
for the Secret Investigation Unit
to interfere.

385
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm not trying to steal

386
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,550
the Elite Constabulary Unit's credit,

387
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,480
nor do I care about
the Yellow Heaven cult.

388
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm only here to ask one thing:

389
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,310
is the key criminal, Huang Wuchang,

390
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,310
connected to Yesha or not?

391
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,150
To be honest,

392
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,310
I didn't want to

393
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,680
make this trip to Weizhou

394
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,070
and go through all this trouble.

395
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,670
But I received intelligence

396
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,720
indicating that

397
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,070
the Yellow Heaven cult

398
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,960
is likely connected to Yesha.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't forget that

400
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,350
the Yesha case

401
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,080
is still under the jurisdiction of
our Secret Investigation Unit.

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,470
Constable Zhong,

403
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
we've worked on cases together before,

404
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,960
but you've repeatedly been dishonest

405
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,480
and played games with me.

406
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,240
To prevent further misunderstandings
between us,

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
I specifically reported to
the Ministry of Justice

408
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,850
and obtained official documents.

409
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,900
The documents clearly state

410
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,720
that the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang,

411
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,570
is to be handed over to
our Secret Investigation Unit.

412
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,190
[Ministry of Justice Permit]

413
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,030
Zhuge Kongyun.

414
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,540
How do you prove

415
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,310
that the key criminal
is connected to Yesha?

416
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,400
It's simple.

417
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,030
I'll know right after interrogation.

418
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,960
If you refuse to hand over
the key criminal

419
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,490
and defy orders from above,

420
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,750
the consequences...

421
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,200
What if your interrogation reveals

422
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,310
the suspect has no connection to Yesha?

423
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,720
False reporting of case details

424
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,320
will surely be dealt with
according to the law.

425
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,770
Constable Zhong, you're a smart person.

426
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Rather than returning to the capital

427
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,270
and risking execution,

428
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,400
you might as well hand
the key criminal over to me

429
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,730
and see if I'll be the one

430
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,670
being executed instead.

431
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,270
Take your criminal

432
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,070
and leave now.

433
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Constable Zhong,
you truly understand what's at stake.

434
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Thanks a lot.

435
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,240
Take him away.

436
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Farewell.

437
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,680
Hold on.

438
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,790
I've handed the criminal over to you.

439
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,000
What else do you want?

440
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
I heard that Coroner Feng and Miss Huo

441
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,400
have also come to Weizhou.

442
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,240
They're in the carriage, right?

443
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,750
Since we've all met before,

444
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,680
I'd better go over

445
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
and say hello.

446
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,190
That won't be necessary.

447
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,810
Just keep your men in line.

448
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,720
Proper etiquette

449
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,730
should still be observed.

450
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,270
I just remembered something.

451
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,770
I heard that Coroner Feng

452
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
nearly lost his life a few days ago
while working on this case in Weizhou.

453
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Since Miss Huo

454
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,310
is in the carriage taking care of him,

455
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,350
I won't disturb them further.

456
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,790
Mr. Zhuge.

457
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

458
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Sorry for my poor manners.

459
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
Get well soon.

460
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,370
What exactly is Zhuge Kongyun

461
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
up to?

462
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
Whatever he's planning,

463
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,830
fortunately, he didn't lift the curtain,

464
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,240
or we'd be in big trouble.

465
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Thank goodness,

466
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,200
we dodged a bullet.

467
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,580
Fortunately, this Zhuge fellow

468
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,720
knows when to back off.

469
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,310
I already had my blade out.

470
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,150
If he dared to lift that curtain,

471
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
I would've chopped his hand off.

472
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,510
It's not that simple.

473
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,240
What do you mean?

474
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,910
From his choice of words,

475
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,310
I'm afraid he already knows

476
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,440
about my presence.

477
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,550
Perhaps he's been

478
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,880
in Weizhou for some time,

479
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
watching us from the shadows.

480
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,310
Then hasn't your cover been blown?

481
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,830
I can't figure it out either.

482
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,240
Taking away a minor henchman,
Huang Wuchang,

483
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,070
should be nothing compared to

484
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,720
capturing me, Yesha, myself.

485
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,790
If he had already discovered

486
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,590
my presence,

487
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,450
why didn't he make a move just now?

488
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,110
Could it be that he hadn't discovered you?

489
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,910
That's right.

490
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,980
He might not have guessed

491
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,110
that you're with us.

492
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,030
Let's hope so.

493
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,520
Young Master.

494
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
There must be something suspicious
about that carriage.

495
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,110
When you passed by the carriage,

496
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,200
Zhong Xueman's expression

497
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
was clearly nervous.

498
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,510
I noticed

499
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,610
she was about to draw her Bi'an Sword.

500
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,820
Of course I know something's off.

501
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,160
Then why didn't you

502
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
expose them just now, Young Master?

503
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,920
Their performance isn't over yet.

504
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
Exposing them now

505
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,720
would spoil the fun.

506
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,750
Might as well

507
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
let them continue

508
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,450
with their little show.

509
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,550
I've finally figured out

510
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,110
the key to the Yesha case.

511
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,940
Since the Secret Investigation Unit

512
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,340
took over the Yesha case,

513
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,160
we've actually

514
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,750
fallen into a misconception.

515
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,330
That is,

516
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,480
we've been following the case all along.

517
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,810
What's wrong with that?

518
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,110
For dealing with ordinary criminals,

519
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,920
that's fine.

520
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,590
But when dealing with Xiao Beiming,

521
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,920
it's a grave mistake.

522
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,030
I've been competing with Xiao Beiming
for years.

523
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,670
I believe my deductive abilities

524
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,680
are no worse than his,

525
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,790
yet I'm always one step behind,

526
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,920
half a beat too slow.

527
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,820
That's because there's one thing

528
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,110
I'm truly not as good at as he is.

529
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,750
What is it?

530
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,480
This is a gamble to start with.

531
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,550
Wanna bet?

532
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,070
If you lose this time,

533
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,920
you'll be doomed.

534
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,500
You've known me for years.

535
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,210
Have you ever seen me lose?

536
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,700
Do you know why you've never

537
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
been able to beat me all these years?

538
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,510
I'm not as willing to take risks as he is.

539
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,490
We thought

540
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,110
he would hide from us

541
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,750
like a mouse from a cat.

542
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,480
But in reality, this gambler

543
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,700
has never considered himself

544
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,550
as the mouse.

545
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,310
Instead, he sees himself as the hunter.

546
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,920
We thought we were hunting him,

547
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,830
but in reality,

548
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,680
we've been led

549
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,750
by the nose all along.

550
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,070
This is why we've always

551
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
failed to catch him.

552
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,920
Are you suggesting

553
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,750
he's been around us all this time?

554
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,270
If he wants to keep leading us on,

555
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,110
then I'll

556
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,440
follow the rope right to him
and catch him.

557
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,480
If well played,

558
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,200
it's going to be

559
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,550
a show that will shock the world.

560
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,550
Xueman.

561
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
I've always been curious about something.

562
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,350
Why do you dislike

563
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,510
Mr. Zhuge so much?

564
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,510
After all,

565
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
he's as renowned as Beiming,

566
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,790
both elite investigators of Qi Kingdom.

567
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,680
Is it just because of the rivalry

568
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,030
between the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit?

569
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,790
But you don't seem like

570
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,480
someone who would care about such things.

571
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,550
I just resent him.

572
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,680
I've always found him annoying.

573
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,110
A grown man always dressing up

574
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,920
all flashy and showy.

575
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,830
Beiming.

576
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,400
If you hadn't stopped me from
beating him up,

577
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
I would've taught him a lesson long ago.

578
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,030
The three of us have known each other
since childhood.

579
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,440
I remember Xueman used to

580
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,160
beat Zhuge Kongyun up when we were little.

581
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Why was that?

582
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,890
This Zhuge Kongyun

583
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,160
may be a bit eccentric,

584
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,920
but he doesn't seem like a bad guy.

585
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,310
It's all just a facade.

586
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
He's been ruthless since childhood,

587
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
dabbling in all sorts of shady practices.

588
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,030
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

589
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,170
I remember a few years ago,

590
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,720
there was a serial murder case,

591
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,510
and to lure out the killer,

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,590
he used the victim as bait.

593
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,310
But that victim

594
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,790
was just

595
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,160
a teenage girl.

596
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,540
He did catch the killer in the end,

597
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,750
but that kid

598
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,550
developed hysteria from the trauma

599
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,750
and became a recluse.

600
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,750
Someone like him

601
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,030
only thinks about himself.

602
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,110
His methods of solving cases

603
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,720
have no moral boundaries, either.

604
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
You're too arrogant in handling cases.

605
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,420
I'm afraid you'll eventually

606
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,680
pay for your arrogance one day.

607
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
In life, one wrong step

608
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,590
often leads to many more.

609
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,160
I don't want you to go astray

610
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,220
and regret it in the future, you know?

611
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,000
You're too proud, even arrogant.

612
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,640
You think of Yesha as a rival

613
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,070
to play the game with,

614
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,240
but his real purpose

615
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,510
is not to defeat you.

616
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,510
You seem to get the upper hand now,

617
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,880
but how do you know

618
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,750
he has no backup plan?

619
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,880
And how do you know

620
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,750
whether he's deliberately

621
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,610
letting you gain this advantage?

622
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,820
We are the same kind of person.

623
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,180
You two are nothing alike.

624
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,030
I've made the same mistakes.

625
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,310
People like us

626
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,680
unconsciously put ourselves

627
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,960
in positions where we can control

628
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,420
others' lives and deaths.

629
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,170
But only by making mistakes

630
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,780
do we learn where to draw the line.

631
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,790
Zhuge Kongyun isn't inherently bad.

632
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,030
He just cares about things

633
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,400
that are different from what others value.

634
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,160
What he cares about

635
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,360
doesn't matter to me.

636
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,090
But about Huang Wuchang,

637
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,750
we can't let his off so easily.

638
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,390
Once we get back to the capital

639
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,730
and cure your illness,

640
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,800
I'll settle the score with him.

641
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,240
Tong Shuang.

642
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,440
Go faster.

643
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,400
Got it, Beiming.

644
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,310
Such a large forest,

645
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,880
yet not even a bird's call can be heard.

646
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
Indeed.

647
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,800
Watch out.

648
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,680
Keep an eye on Huang Wuchang.

649
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Yes.

650
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,400
Danger! It's an ambush!

651
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,210
This smoke is poisonous...

652
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,640
Here.

653
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,510
Xueman.

654
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,790
You can't stay here.

655
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,630
The Elite Constabulary Unit
must already know

656
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,480
that Huang Wuchang and you

657
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,240
have returned to the capital.

658
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,590
If you don't go to
the Elite Constabulary Unit to report,

659
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,250
Fang Tianzheng will definitely
be suspicious.

660
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,920
They are all here

661
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
taking care of me.

662
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,880
Don't worry.

663
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,480
If you keep staying here

664
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,200
and Fang Tianzheng becomes suspicious,

665
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
things will get even more complicated.

666
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,080
Tong Shuang.

667
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,270
Go find out

668
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,790
if Old Bug has shown up recently.

669
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,160
This is the most urgent matter right now.

670
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
Alright, I'll go right away.

671
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,270
Coroner Feng, your injuries...

672
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,790
Don't worry, I'm okay.

673
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,480
I'll prepare some medicine
as soon as possible

674
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,750
to ease Beiming's pain

675
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,070
and buy as much time as we can.

676
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't worry.

677
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,830
We'll take good care of Beiming.

678
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,070
Zhong Xueman.

679
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,880
I thought you had finally
made something of yourself,

680
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,760
that you could bring great merit
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

681
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,440
so we could finally redeem our reputation.

682
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,500
But what happened?

683
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,510
The key criminal we went to such lengths
to capture

684
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,300
was snatched away by that sly fox
Zhuge Kongyun

685
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,830
right from under our noses.

686
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,790
If you had

687
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,640
sent me word earlier,

688
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,830
couldn't I have

689
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,050
negotiated with the Ministry of Justice?

690
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,310
Getting the proper documents
wouldn't have been difficult.

691
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,200
Chief.

692
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,590
It was my oversight.

693
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,610
A perfect opportunity for redemption

694
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,440
has fallen into

695
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
the Secret Investigation Unit's hands
just like that.

696
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,070
Huang Wuchang is connected to Yesha,

697
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,560
and he still has many secrets

698
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,270
that haven't been revealed.

699
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,000
Chief.

700
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,510
Could we request an audience
with His Majesty

701
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,590
to get him back from

702
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,750
the Secret Investigation Unit?

703
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,410
An audience with His Majesty?

704
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,790
On what grounds?

705
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,480
Huang Wuchang

706
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,010
was captured
by our Elite Constabulary Unit.

707
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,200
But wasn't Yesha Xiao Beiming also from

708
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,830
our Elite Constabulary Unit?

709
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,480
Xiao...

710
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,720
Regardless of whether Xiao Beiming
is Yesha or not,

711
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
as long as we can get Huang Wuchang,

712
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,020
make him talk,

713
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,880
and solve the Yesha case,

714
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,739
it would only benefit
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

715
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,280
Chief.

716
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,159
The Yesha case

717
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,590
concerns the reputation of
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

718
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,880
Please don't hesitate anymore.

719
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,190
I've confronted this man before.

720
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,280
He's completely insane,

721
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,630
and interrogating him won't be easy.

722
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,320
If he dies in the hands of
the Secret Investigation Unit,

723
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,630
we'll have no more leads
on the Yesha case.

724
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,190
Uncle!

725
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,110
Why are you calling me uncle?

726
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,230
How many times have I told you

727
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,800
not to call me uncle here?

728
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
News just came

729
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,750
that the key criminal from Weizhou

730
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,110
was abducted

731
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,840
while being escorted back to the capital.

732
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,280
You...

733
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm incompetent

734
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,360
and failed to keep watch
over the key criminal.

735
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,110
His Majesty will summon us tomorrow.

736
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,920
How should we explain this to him?

737
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,139
If His Majesty flies into a rage,

738
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,000
I fear our deaths may soon follow!

739
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,310
It was my negligence.

740
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,920
I'll take full responsibility.

741
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,760
Now is not the time to be heroic.

742
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,160
Come up with a solution
as soon as possible.

743
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,290
[Sanli Teahouse]

744
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,740
Why have you come to see me?

745
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,400
Are you here to mock me

746
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,880
before I die,

747
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,880
or did your conscience suddenly kick in

748
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,410
and you want to say goodbye?

749
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,000
Say goodbye?

750
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,480
Don't pretend that you don't know.

751
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,320
My father and I

752
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,400
made a military pledge before His Majesty

753
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
to solve the Yesha case by the deadline.

754
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,310
Now, the case remains unsolved,

755
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,000
and Huang Wuchang has been abducted.

756
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,130
Tomorrow, His Majesty will summon us,

757
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,490
which will likely be our death sentence.

758
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,720
What exactly did you come to see me for?

759
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,320
There's only one way

760
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,680
to save you and your father.

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,800
What's that?

762
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,860
Recapture Huang Wuchang.

763
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,000
I can help you,

764
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,050
but you need to tell me

765
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,800
all the details about

766
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,070
Huang Wuchang's abduction.

767
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,530
Otherwise, I can't help you
even if I want to.

768
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,420
Even if I tell you

769
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,550
the inside story
of Huang Wuchang's abduction,

770
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,510
you won't be able

771
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,260
to catch him any time soon.

772
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,510
So telling you makes no difference.

773
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,540
That's not necessarily true.

774
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,610
You know something, don't you?

775
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,360
For Huang Wuchang to be abducted

776
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,230
from under the tight security of
your Secret Investigation Unit,

777
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,760
while everyone from your unit

778
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
remained completely unharmed,

779
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,070
there's only one possibility:

780
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,030
poison was used.

781
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,130
Someone did use poison.

782
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
What else do you know?

783
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
How was Huang Wuchang abducted?

784
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,070
I don't know the specifics,

785
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,550
but the people escorting Huang Wuchang

786
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,010
numbered at least a dozen,

787
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,710
all experts from
the Secret Investigation Unit,

788
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,440
with Zhuge Kongyun in command.

789
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,200
How could that person abduct him

790
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,710
without harming a single person

791
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,070
under those circumstances?

792
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,000
Unless it was...

793
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,800
Old Bug.

794
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
Xueman, but you need to

795
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,030
verify this information

796
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,150
with Zhuge Kongyun.

797
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,880
But Old Bug has seen you before.

798
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,280
If Zhuge Kongyun

799
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,630
learns this information

800
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,090
and finds him before we do,

801
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,010
your injuries will never heal,

802
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,880
and your whereabouts will be exposed.

803
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,150
Our top priority now

804
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,630
is to find Huang Wuchang.

805
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,190
Our strength alone isn't enough.

806
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,120
We need
the Secret Investigation Unit's resources.

807
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,230
Using Zhuge Kongyun's resources

808
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,710
to catch Old Bug,

809
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,630
while also trying to take Old Bug away

810
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,890
before he realizes it,

811
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,190
that's too risky.

812
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,750
Given the situation,

813
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,290
we have no other choice.

814
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,230
That person actually managed

815
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,800
to silently poison

816
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,660
your Secret Investigation Unit.

817
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,520
Whoever abducted him

818
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,190
must be a master of poison.

819
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,360
I happen to know

820
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,420
someone like that,

821
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,440
and he works for Yesha.

822
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,880
Who is it?

823
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,360
Old Bug, from Poison Valley.

824
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,320
Old Bug?

825
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,710
Someone released poisonous gas

826
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,110
into the air,

827
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,670
and by the time I realized,

828
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,000
it was already too late.

829
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
But how did Old Bug know?

830
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,590
The escort route was supposed to be
top secret.

831
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,390
That's right.

832
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,000
I suspect there's

833
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,880
a spy within
the Secret Investigation Unit.

834
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,480
I'm investigating,

835
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,070
but right now,
I don't have the slightest clue.

836
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,800
There must be a flaw somewhere.

837
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,150
I'll keep investigating.

838
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,980
Since I was able to

839
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,960
catch Huang Wuchang once,

840
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,110
I can certainly catch him a second time.

841
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,360
Waiter, bill please.

842
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,990
Zhong Xueman!

843
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,470
What's wrong?

844
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Beiming is gone.
