[Young and promising]

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,640
You've come

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,100
for revenge, haven't you?

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm not afraid of you!

7
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,510
Come on!

8
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,590
-Master! Master!
-Take revenge on me!

9
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
-Master, what's wrong?
-Revenge!

10
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,710
Come on!

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,620
Master!

12
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,160
Master!

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,960
-Revenge!
-Master! Master!

14
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll give it back to you.

[Episode 8]

17
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,960
You want me to go find him

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,190
and investigate the case with him?

19
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,630
Do you remember which year I told you

20
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,840
about the incident in Haiya?

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,280
The 36th year of Ningtai.

22
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Miao Jie once said

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,400
that Master was terrified of people

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
finding out about what happened back then.

25
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560
If that incident refers to

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,020
the destruction of Haiya,

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,260
then that year should be

28
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,660
the 36th year of Ningtai.

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,590
Since Miao Jie mentioned this matter,

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,360
it means he's also privy to it.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,079
So we need to check

32
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,870
Master's and Miao Jie's resume documents

33
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,870
to see where they were

34
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,910
and what they did

35
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,910
in that year,

36
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,430
which might give us some leads.

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,280
But all officials' resume documents

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,400
are kept in the Imperial Secretariat,

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
and the Elite Constabulary Unit

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,470
doesn't have major case authority now.

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,710
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

42
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,960
we can't enter the Imperial Secretariat

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
and access those documents.

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,250
So that's why you want me

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,650
to go find Zhuge Kongyun?

46
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,590
But he's naturally suspicious.

47
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,720
Why would he help me?

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,470
When fishing, you need bait, of course.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Young Master,

50
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,800
did you stay up all night?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
I've gone through

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
these four officials' documents

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,840
several times already,

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,970
but I really can't see anything wrong.

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,040
All I can tell is that they have

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,240
served the country and the people

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,310
with utmost dedication.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,190
I really don't understand

59
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,360
why Xiao Beiming would target

60
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,650
these four officials.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,550
Young Master,

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,510
are we on the wrong track?

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,190
No,

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
we're on the right track.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Have you found something

66
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,070
in these documents?

67
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,159
The Council Chamber?

68
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,120
The problem lies in the Council Chamber.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,659
the late emperor passed away

71
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,920
and His Majesty ascended the throne.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
The late emperor was gravely ill then,

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,630
too weak to attend court,

74
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,120
so several officials

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,430
from various ministries
were temporarily assigned

76
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,120
to help him handle state affairs.

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,180
The side hall

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,240
where these officials were stationed

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,510
was called the Council Chamber.

80
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,040
The 36th year of Ningtai...

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,950
This year is the 22nd year of Xingwen.

82
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
Even if the four officials

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
worked together in the Council Chamber,

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,060
that was over 20 years ago.

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
Could Xiao Beiming really kill them

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
just because of that?

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,310
Xiao Beiming was too young

88
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,720
to remember anything back then.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Besides the tombstone statue,

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,540
this is the only connection

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,360
we've found between these four officials.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,190
The Council Chamber

93
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,920
isn't a motive for the killing.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,110
So I'm wondering

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
if these four officials

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,430
did anything together at that time

97
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,870
and caused any trouble.

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
But there's nothing recorded

99
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,860
in these documents.

100
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,270
Precisely.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,930
And that makes it more suspicious.

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,270
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

103
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,190
what exactly happened?

104
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,750
Young Master,

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,750
someone is asking to see you.

106
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,510
Who is it?

107
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,000
It's Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

108
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,070
Since childhood,

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,820
you've never approached me

110
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,150
on your own initiative.

111
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,530
Is there something important

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,580
for you to come here this time?

113
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,050
Haven't you always wanted

114
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,000
to work with me?

115
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,970
You've changed your mind?

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,170
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
Is Mr. Shen dead?

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,890
You're well-informed.

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,390
I'm not surprised.

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,940
Seven officials were killed 3 years ago,

121
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,230
and one of them was my father.

122
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,570
Recently in the corpse-sewing case,

123
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,340
seven more people died.

124
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,470
Including Mr. Shen,

125
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,680
a total of 15 people

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
were brutally killed by Yesha.

127
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Compared to these lives,

128
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,480
the feud between our two units

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
means nothing.

130
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
If we can catch Yesha sooner,

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
everyone

132
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,820
will be relieved much sooner.

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,270
I do hate Yesha,

134
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,570
but I can still tell right from wrong.

135
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,890
It's admirable

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,920
that you can think that way.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,870
So you agree?

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,070
Mr. Shen died tragically.

139
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,400
His Majesty was furious

140
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,090
and ordered the Secret Investigation Unit

141
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
to solve this case

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,870
and arrest Yesha within a month.

143
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,270
Having your help at this time

144
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,750
is exactly what I need.

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,480
But now

146
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,160
all the clues have been cut off,

147
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
and I'm completely lost.

148
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,360
I actually have a clue.

149
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm all ears.

150
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,159
I can tell you,

151
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,790
but you need to promise me

152
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,070
that I can investigate the case with you.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,270
That depends on whether this clue

154
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,200
is useful or not.

155
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,800
If it's useless...

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Zhuge Kongyun,

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,680
if it weren't for wanting

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
to catch Yesha quickly,

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
I would never have come to see you.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
I've already broken

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,270
the Elite Constabulary Unit's rules,

162
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,070
yet you're still playing games with me.

163
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,430
Since you don't trust me,

164
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,630
let's part ways here.

165
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,950
Wait!

166
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,890
You're so quick-tempered.

167
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,750
What is needed for investigating a case?

168
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,040
Calmness.

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
Look at you!

170
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,930
Can you just...

171
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,360
Fine.

172
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,310
I promise you.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,460
But I also have one condition.

174
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,430
Speak.

175
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,390
If I capture Yesha, Xiao Beiming,

176
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,840
you can't take justice
into your own hands.

177
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,909
He must be handed over to my unit,

178
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,360
agreed?

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Agreed.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,480
If your mind isn't calm,

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,750
you won't win.

182
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,390
Is it because of

183
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
Mr. Shen Bi?

184
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,610
Mr. Shen died because of me,

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,550
yet I have no clues.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So you made a risky move

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,720
by sending Xueman to find Zhuge Kongyun.

188
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
Attack can be a form of defense,

189
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
and defense can be a strategy for attack.

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
This is a risky move,

191
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,240
but also a vital one.

192
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,600
But Zhuge Kongyun

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,870
won't be content just to be a mere pawn.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,390
If there's even the slightest oversight,

195
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,080
he'll jump off the chessboard.

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,140
When that happens,

197
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,060
you won't be able to control the situation.

198
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,410
Make your move.

199
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,150
Master.

200
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,130
Do those orphans from Haiya

201
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,390
have anything to do with you?

202
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,380
You said Xiao Beiming had a big fight

203
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,720
with King Zhong of Constables

204
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
before the Fengbo Lake case?

205
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,590
That's right.

206
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,100
They argued fiercely.

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,500
But I didn't hear

208
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,150
the specific details of their argument.

209
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,960
I only vaguely heard a few words.

210
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,440
What words?

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,120
The 36th year of Ningtai.

212
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,370
What does that mean?

213
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,320
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

214
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,960
I wasn't even born then.

215
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,420
I don't know what it means,

216
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,600
but the fact that they mentioned

217
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,650
this year during their argument

218
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,850
must be significant.

219
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm wondering

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,550
what exactly happened that year.

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,130
Could it be related to Yesha

222
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,250
killing my father?

223
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,200
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

224
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,750
where did King Zhong of Constables work?

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,030
My father once mentioned he was a soldier

226
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,150
before joining
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

227
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,790
But I don't know

228
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,080
which army he served in

229
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
specifically.

230
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,650
That's why I came to you,

231
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,950
hoping to check my father's documents.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
My Lords,

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,210
here are the dossiers you requested.

235
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,960

My Lords,

241
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,630
is there anything

242
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,790
I can help you with?

243
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,100
How could these documents

244
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,430
be tampered with?

245
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,120
Well...

please be careful with your words.

Don't make accusations like that easily.

248
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
See for yourself.

249
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,150
The documents of King Zhong of Constables

250
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,720
from the 36th year of Ningtai and earlier

251
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,920
have all been torn up.

252
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,630
This...

253
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,950
I really don't know

254
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,930
what happened.

255
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,700
For officials of his rank,

256
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,840
their documents

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
must be personally reviewed

258
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,630
by His Majesty and the cabinet

259
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,550
every year

260
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,360
before they can be filed and sealed.

261
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,870
Not to mention tearing them up,

262
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,440
even to review them,

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,790
you need to have a review order.

264
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
So what's going on here?

265
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,720
Unless

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,140
they had been torn up before being filed.

267
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
How dare you!

268
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,370
I wouldn't dare.

269
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,610
Forgive me, My Lord.

270
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,510
Leave.

271
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,150
Yes.

272
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,450
Is he suggesting...

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,700
Could it be that His Majesty...

274
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,690
So what should we do now?

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
Although his documents

276
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
were torn up,

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,150
after the 36th year of Ningtai,

278
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
he was indeed transferred
from the Ministry of War

279
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,790
to the Ministry of Justice.

280
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,440
We can check

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,910
the documents of the Ministry of War.

282
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,840
Since the King of Constables
once served in the military,

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
there must be comrades we can trace.

284
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,390
Let's see

285
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,360
who used to work with him

286
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960

291
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,120
We've been waiting so long,

292
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
yet Constable Zhong hasn't come back.

293
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,850
Could something have happened to her?

294
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,860
That woman

295
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,770
could handle ten sly foxes

296
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,300

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,440
You think Zhuge Kongyun

298
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
is just like you,

299
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,250
only knowing how to fight and kill?

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,490
Then what else is there to be afraid of?

301
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,960

302
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,390
I just bought some sweet tofu

and it's still warm.

304
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,890
I'm not hungry. Give it to Feng Qingzhuo.

305
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,850
Isn't it hot?

306
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,200
No.

307
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,240
It's not hot.

308
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,930
How's my speed
at investigating these dossiers

309
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,930
compared to Xiao Beiming back then?

310
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,630
Let's get to the point.

311
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,030
Have you found anything?

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,570
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Miao Jie, Huo Zongyao]

313
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,640
Miao Jie?

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,870
Huo Zongyao?

315
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,080
Like King Zhong of Constables,

316
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,130
their documents
from the 36th year of Ningtai

317
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,910
and before

318
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,220
have also been torn up.

319
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,270
It seems

320
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,400
someone

321
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,120
doesn't want us to discover

322
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,080
what happened back then.

323
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

324
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,510
along with your father.

325
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,390
Now only General Huo is still alive.

326
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,510
He retired
from the Ministry of War last year

327
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,150
and is now living in retirement at home.

328
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,550
Let's go find him.

329
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,990
Constable Zhong, I remember 3 years ago

330
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,670
when you married Xiao Beiming,

331
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,330
General Huo was also present.

332
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,600
What was his relationship

333
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,860
with your father like?

334
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
I've met General Huo a few times,

335
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,370
just normal interactions.

336
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,720
Our families had no personal connection,

337
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
no gatherings or visits.

338
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,600
I don't know anyone
from the Huo family at all.

339
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,670
That's strange.

340
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,030
General Huo and King Zhong of Constables

341
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,150
were once comrades in the army.

342
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,010
Logically speaking,

343
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,720
they should have had a good relationship,

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,960
not as distant as

345
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,790
you remember.

346
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm certain I'm not mistaken.

347
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,750
We're almost there.

348
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Let's go find out.

349
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,870
Someone has died.

350
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,150
Could it be General Huo?

351
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,790
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

352
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,270
Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

353
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,910
I'm here on urgent business
to see General Huo Zongyao.

354
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,200
You've come at a bad time.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,320
My master...

356
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,650
passed away last night.

357
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,270
General Huo is dead?

358
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,120
That's right.

359
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Another one died?

360
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,150
What's the cause of death?

361
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,120
The Huo family said

362
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,030
that he died suddenly of an old illness.

363
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,360
General Huo
held a high position with great authority.

364
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,450
At a time like this, even Zhuge Kongyun

365
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,870
can't enter the residence
to ask questions.

366
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,840
We can only wait until after the funeral.

367
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,120
When we investigated Mr. Shen,

368
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
he died.

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,480
When we investigated General Huo,

370
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
he also died.

371
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,390
This is definitely not a coincidence.

372
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,090
You suspect

373
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,630
Yesha's people did this too?

374
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,510
We need to investigate to find out.

375
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,720
I need to go to the Huo Mansion.

376
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,440
Boss, no!

377
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,960
You're a wanted criminal now!

378
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,480
Yes, it's too dangerous.

379
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,030
The Secret Investigation Unit
knows you're still alive.

380
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,120
Timing is crucial in investigations.

381
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Many key pieces of evidence
vanish in an instant.

382
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,970
If I had been present

383
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,870
when Mr. Shen died,

384
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,970
I could have immediately

385
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,870
determined his cause of death.

386
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,750
Then the poisoner

387
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,000
would not have escaped.

388
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,400
General Huo died
in the early hours of last night.

389
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,440
There's still time.

390
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,790
But if we really wait
until after the funeral,

391
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,349
it will be too late.

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,790
Xueman.

393
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,210
What happened with Mr. Shen

394
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,880
cannot happen again.

395
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,640
I understand.

396
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll see to it.

397
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,680
What kind of strange clothes are these?

398
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
There are bats and the moon.

399
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Are you afraid that others won't see us?

400
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
You fool.

401
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,960
General Huo's body is lying in state.

402
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
Many people will come to

403
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
pay their respects to the deceased.

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,960
In the Huo Mansion,

405
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,880
they need to light the ever-burning lamps

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,920
and someone
must watch over the flames all night.

407
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,640
Look.

408
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,630
Those people lighting the lamps

409
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,890
are all wearing these.

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
This is the attire of night watchman.

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
Then what do these bats

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
and the moon mean?

413
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,240
Bat sounds like "fu",
meaning fortune in Chinese.

414
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,530
Four bats surrounding the moon

415
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,510
resembles a copper coin,
symbolizing prosperity.

416
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,510
Since life is gone,

417
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,310
it is important
to hold onto fortune and prosperity.

418
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,750
Those who keep vigil for the deceased,

419
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,790
apart from family members,

420
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,270
are often honored guests.

421
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,590
So the servants won't ask many questions.

422
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,830
Well,

423
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,090
you may not be tall,

424
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,450
but you know quite a lot.

425
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,160
Let's first examine

426
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,310
General Huo's body.

427
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,030
Be careful.

428
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,590
If we're discovered, I'll cover the rear

429
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,550
while you all escape.

430
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm a grown man standing right here...

431
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,400
And you want to be the hero?

432
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Enough.

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,110
We came together,
and we should leave together.

434
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,270
Stay alert

435
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,240
and act according to circumstances.

436
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,640
Especially you, Tong Shuang,

437
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
don't be reckless.

438
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,590
Don't worry, Boss.

439
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,590
I will be careful.

440
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,550
Let's go.

441
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,070
Did you hear that?

442
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,030
Stay calm.

443
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,640
Be careful.

444
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,880
Mind and behave yourself!

445
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,050
[Memorial Tablet of General Huo Zongyao]

446
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,070
[General Huo's eldest disciple
Xue Qianshan]

447
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,600
[General Huo's second disciple
Li Xiao]

448
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,620
I've long heard that General Huo

449
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,110
took in many disciples
and kept them in his mansion.

450
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,000
Today I see it's indeed true.

451
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,110
Those people in the front hall

452
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,290
are clearly skilled fighters.

453
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,950
We must avoid provoking them.

454
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,070
The Huo Mansion is vast.

455
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,400
The study, bedrooms,

456
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,200
and places where General Huo

457
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,390
used to go

458
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,960
might all contain important clues.

459
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
Now the mansion is busy with people,

460
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,230
making it the perfect time to blend in.

461
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,320
Let's split up.

462
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,960
Tong Shuang,

463
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,310
you and I will go to
General Huo's quarters.

464
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,920
Xueman,

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,150
take Feng Qingzhuo to the backyard.

466
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,770
In an hour,

467
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,990
we'll meet back here.

468
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,310
Be careful.

469
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,510
You search over there.

470
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,240
What about you?

471
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,110
I'll go to the disciples' quarters.

472
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,230
I think we should

473
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,540
stay together.

474
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,890
Are you scared?

475
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Who's scared?

476
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,660
[Excellent in medical skills
and noble in medical ethics]

477
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,550
Please,

478
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
don't kill me.

479
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,170
You're not here to keep vigil.

480
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,270
Who are you?

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,680
Tell me,

482
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
what are you doing in my home?

483
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,110
Since you're a girl,

484
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,440
I don't want to hurt you.

485
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,590
Be sensible

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,030
and don't scream.

487
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,960
You're a girl too.

488
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,780
As a girl yourself,

489
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,110
why do you have to
make things difficult for another girl?

490
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,710
Judging by your appearance,

491
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,760
I guess you're not here to steal.

492
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,870
This is the training ground,

493
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,640
full of weapons and armor,

494
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
with nothing of value.

495
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,110
Even the stupidest thief

496
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,710
wouldn't come here to steal.

497
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,000
I found you,

498
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,030
but you didn't kill me or run away,

499
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,020
which means you haven't finished

500
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,420
what you wanted to do yet.

501
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,790
Are you here

502
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
in my house

503
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,210
to investigate something?

504
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,550
Could it be related to

505
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,310
General Huo's death?

506
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,880
You're wearing
your family's mourning clothes.

507
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,740
Are you a relative of General Huo?

508
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
To be honest,

509
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,310
my name is Huo Dairong.

510
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,350
I am Huo Zongyao's daughter.

511
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,960
You suspect Huo Zongyao's death

512
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,050
is connected to Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

513
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,560
Do you have any evidence?

514
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,240
Any basis for your theory?

515
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,400
Intuition.

516
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,670
If we relied on intuition to solve cases,

517
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,430
what would be the point of laws?

518
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,550
Don't say things like that

519
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,680
in front of me again.

520
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,350
Father.

521
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,950
Enough. If there really is
something suspicious

522
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,960
about Huo Zongyao's death,

523
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,480
the Huo family will report it.

524
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,640
You are too obsessed with Xiao Beiming,

525
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
trapped in it without realizing it.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,330
But time is running out.

527
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,400
Any suspicious point

528
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,110
could be

529
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,510
the key to finding Yesha.

530
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,470
If we suspect Yesha every time

531
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,270
there's a murder in the capital,

532
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
our Secret Investigation Unit

533
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
wouldn't be able to keep up

534
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,590
even with superhuman powers.

535
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,160
Being so impatient for results

536
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,070
will only let Xiao Beiming

537
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,590
lead you by the nose.

538
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,350
Calm down and think it through.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,640
As General Huo's daughter,

540
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,960
you're not keeping vigil
at the mourning hall.

541
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Instead, you're here
at the training ground.

542
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,880
No lamps,

543
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,270
but armed with weapons.

544
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,480
No matter how I look at it, Miss Huo,

545
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,400
you seem to be doing

546
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,660
something dangerous.

547
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,920
It seems you're not
an ordinary woman either.

548
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
That's right.

549
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,240
My father died suddenly,

550
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
with many suspicious circumstances.

551
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,620
I came here to investigate

552
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,310
the cause of my father's death as well.

553
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Don't be afraid.

554
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,150
As long as you stay quiet,

555
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,310
I won't hurt you.

556
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
You're Zhong Xueman.

557
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Although you're wearing this robe,

558
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,690
the boots on your feet

559
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,820
are official boots.

560
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,030
In the entire Qi Kingdom,

561
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,440
women who can wear official boots

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
are already rare enough,

563
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,750
and those with such martial skills

564
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
are even rarer.

565
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,880
If I'm not mistaken,

566
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,080
that weapon in your hand

567
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,920
is the legendary Bi'an Sword, isn't it?

568
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,950
-You…
-Don’t think too much.

569
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,920
I've always been

570
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,250
interested in criminal investigations.

571
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,160
I just know

572
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,110
a bit more than others, that's all.

573
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,200
I've heard plenty of stories

574
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,640
about the Elite Constabulary Unit.

575
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Judging by your reaction,

576
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,680
I must be right.

577
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,450
Since we have the same goal,

578
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,210
why don't we work together?

579
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,310
You don't even know my intentions,

580
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,340
yet you're willing to trust
an outsider like me?

581
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,510
Compared to you,

582
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
in this entire house,

583
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,210
I have no one else to trust.

584
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,240
Besides,

585
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I want to see

586
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,180
if the famous Zhong Xueman

587
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
is really as good as they say.

588
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,360
If my father had secrets,

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,070
they must be hidden in his bedroom.

590
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,270
If Constable Zhong wants to investigate,

591
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,000
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

592
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
I can show you the way.

593
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Have you heard?

594
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
General Huo will be buried tomorrow.

595
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,880
Tomorrow?

596
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
That's too fast.

597
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,750
Shouldn't the body
lie in state for seven days?

598
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,400
Yes,

599
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,080
but I heard

600
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
it was decided by Madam

601
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,180
and senior disciples.

602
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,270
I see.

603
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,160
Tomorrow?

604
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,720
That's not right.

605
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Boss, you're right.

606
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,960
There must be something suspicious

607
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,490
about Huo Zongyao's death.

608
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,440
Where's Xueman?

609
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Hasn't she returned yet?

610
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
Why did you two split up?

611
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,880
I...

612
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,610
I'll go find her.

613
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,270
Help!

614
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Go!

615
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,400
Go!

616
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,510
Go!

617
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,240
Madam, are you hurt?

618
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,920
I was just

619
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,770
[General Huo's wife, Mrs. Huo]

620
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,880
sorting through Master's belongings

621
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,810
when this person suddenly broke in

622
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,250
and tried to assault me.

623
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,270
You brazen thief!

624
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,880
How dare you break into
the Huo Mansion at night?

625
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,080
Sorting belongings?

626
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,510
Then why were you lying on the bed

627
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,240
with your clothes disheveled?

628
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,750
You...

629
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,510
You're a woman!

630
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,920
Boss, I'll go help her.

631
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,570
Don't be reckless.

632
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Boss.

633
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,070
We can't just

634
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,730
leave Constable Zhong there.

635
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,690
Tong Shuang.

636
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
You go.

637
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,510
Who are you?

638
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
What do you want at the Huo Mansion?

639
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,790
I'm Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

640
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,190
I'm here to investigate.

641
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,110
Clever.

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,270
Let's go.

643
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,790
Let's go.

644
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,830
You claim to be from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

645
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,090
What proof do you have?

646
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,880
Of course.

647
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,310
Just as I thought, an impostor.

648
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,030
Guards!

649
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,110
Stop!

650
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,790
There is indeed a female constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

651
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,070
She is the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables,

652
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,000
Zhong Xueman.

653
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,200
Zhong Xueman.

654
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,350
Like King Zhong of Constables,

655
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,350
their documents
from the 36th year of Ningtai

656
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,150
and before

657
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,240
have also been torn up.

658
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,370
Someone definitely doesn't want us

659
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,110
to discover what happened back then.

660
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,160
Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

661
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,590
along with your father.

662
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,980
Now only General Huo is still alive.

663
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,530
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Huo Zongyao's Dossier]

664
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,880
What exactly happened

665
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,960
in the 36th year of Ningtai?

666
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,160
Li Long.

667
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,350
Young Master.

668
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,500
Prepare the horses.

669
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,270
It's late. Where are you going?

670
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
Bad news!

671
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,880
Bad news!

672
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,110
Speak.

673
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,110
Someone stole

674
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,240
Master's dead body.

675
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,790
Where are the guards in the mourning hall?

676
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,920
They all came here.

677
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,790
This is bad.

678
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
It's a diversion tactic.

679
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,000
They have accomplices.

680
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,830
Tie her up.

681
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,480
When I catch your accomplices,

682
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,720
I'll interrogate you all together.

683
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,640
Hurry up

684
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,240
and retrieve Master's body.

685
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,000
Chase them!

686
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,240
No.

687
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Is this what you call a good plan?

688
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,000
With Xueman's position
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

689
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,980
and being the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables,

690
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,510
the Huo family

691
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,400
won't harm her.

692
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,470
As long as we have

693
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,270
Huo Zongyao's body in our possession,

694
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,510
we can exchange it for her.

695
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,480
But why do we have to
use the body for the exchange?

696
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,160
Because this body

697
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,690
definitely holds secrets.

699
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,070

700
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,460
Yes.

701
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,410
-Yes.
-Yes.

702
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,070
Go see what's happening.

703
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,720
Yes.

-Stop!
-Stop!

705
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,350
Stop!

706
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,000
Stop!

707
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,160
They're quite fast.

708
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,310
Where are we going now?

709
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,400
The morgue at the White River.

710
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,350
They're catching up.

711
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,980
What should we do?

712
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,220
Can you stop them?

Stop!

Drive steadily.

00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,750
Stop!

719
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,030
Stop!

00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,350
Stop!

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,270
heading toward the morgue.

726
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,510
Let's go back for more men

727
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,720
and head to the morgue.

728

Yes!

Yes!.

730

Someone in the morgue
will definitely recognize me.

731
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,270
What should we do then?

732
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,530
Is there any other way?

733
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,730
We can only rely on this.

00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,720
So early in the morning.

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,510

00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,270
Thank you, General,

737
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,400
for coming to help today.

738
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,440
Mr. Zhong,

739
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,270
no need for formalities between us.

-Yes.
-Yes.

Over here, quickly!

746

Search faster!

748
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,480
do you have any poison left?

749
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,590
Yes, in my box.

750
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,640
Take the lighter

751
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,810
and just light it up.

752
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,830
Why is this different from before?

753
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,750
The poison has run out.

754
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,030
That's just mosquito repellent,

755
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,550
enough to scare them off.

756
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Poisonous smoke!

757
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,830
What are you waiting for?

758
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,440
Get in there!

759
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,890
Retrieve Master's body!

760
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,510
Someone inside knows how to use poison.

761
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,570
Listen up in there!

762
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
Hand over my Master's body

763
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,530
and I'll spare your lives.

764
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,480
Fire!

765
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,150
Force the people inside out.

766
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

767
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,740
Don't you dare!

768
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,050
There are people
from the Elite Constabulary Unit inside.

769
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,440
I don't care who they are.

770
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,510
They stole my Master's body,

771
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,770
so what if we kill them?

772
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,640
Burn them!

773
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,270
Yes!

774
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,370
What's happening outside?

775
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,720
They're going to set fire.

776
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,480
Are you afraid?

777
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,510
I'm a coroner.

778
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,460
Until I complete the autopsy,

779
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,240
even with a knife at my throat,

780
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,750
I won't stop.

781
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,270
General Huo's body is still inside.

782
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,590
Are you going to burn

783
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,940
General Huo's body too?

784
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,480
I'll give you

785
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,510
one last chance

786
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,960
to hand over my Master's body.

787
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,640
Enough!

788
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,810
Don't waste words on them.

789
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,320
Who dares cause trouble here?

790
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,000
Finally you're here.

791
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,510
The morgue was just repaired

792
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,230
[Morgue]

793
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,150
and you want to burn it again?

794
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,670
Don't you know that in the Qi Kingdom,

795
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,070
arson is a serious crime?

796
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,960
Chief Fang,

797
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,360
the people
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

798
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,920
stole my Master's body.

799
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,030
How would you judge that crime?

800
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,230
Who are you?

801
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,840
Greetings, Chief Fang.

802
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,710
I am Huo Zongyao's disciple,

803
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,400
Li Xiao.

804
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,040
This is my senior fellow disciple,

805
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,960
Xue Qianshan.

806
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
I am General Huo's widow.

807
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,170
Greetings, Chief Fang.

808
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,800
Just now

809
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,670
our family members were a bit rash.

810
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,270
I apologize on their behalf.

811
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,190
However,

812
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,260
Constable Zhong
broke into our residence at night,

813
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,470
and two other accomplices

814
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,150
took advantage of the chaos

815
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,760
and stole the general's body.

816
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
What we just did

817
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,620
was truly out of desperation.

818
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,190
With such investigation methods,

819
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,460
shouldn't the Elite Constabulary Unit

820
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,260
give our family an explanation?

821
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,230
Constable Zhong.

822
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,630
Is what they're saying true?

823
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,610
Come here and talk to me.

824
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,850
I told you to come down!

825
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,960
Who's in there?

826
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,800
Hand over General Huo's body

827
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,640
immediately.

828
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,760
Impossible.

829
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,320
This doesn't make sense.

830
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,900
His tongue is swollen and purple-black,

831
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,710
with hemorrhaging in the eyes.

832
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,000
These are signs of strangulation.

833
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,630
But the skin on his neck is smooth,

834
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,670
normal in color,

835
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
with no ligature marks.

836
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,440
There are no signs

837
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,710
of any external force.

838
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,590
No injuries anywhere on his body,

839
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,710
no signs of poisoning,

840
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,510
and his neck bones aren't broken.

841
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,550
How is that possible?

842
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,360
Impossible.

843
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,760
I suspect General Huo's death

844
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,490
is connected to the Yesha case.

845
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,110
What nonsense are you talking about?

846
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,310
The reason we brought

847
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,190
General Huo's body here

848
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,590
is to uncover the truth.

849
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

850
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,760
whenever a military or political official

851
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,190
of the fifth rank or above

852
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,400
is killed,

853
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820
regardless of whether a report is filed,

854
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,800
[Morgue]

855
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,190
the Ministry of Justice has the authority
to conduct a thorough investigation.

856
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,440
Since General Huo's death

857
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,630
involves clues to the Yesha case,

858
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,140
then today

859
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,630
Constable Zhong's actions are simply

860
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,190
following the law.

861
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,640
That was in the past.

862
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,590
Chief Fang.

863
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,630
Nowadays, all major cases in the capital

864
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,190
fall under the jurisdiction
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

865
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,320
Even if an investigation is needed,

866
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,190
it should be conducted by
the Secret Investigation Unit.

867
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,710
What authority
does your Elite Constabulary Unit have?

868
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,590
What did you say?

869
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,190
What did you say?

870
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,360
How dare you say that?

871
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,150
Try saying that again.

872
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
If I'm not mistaken,

873
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,760
I request that the Elite Constabulary Unit

874
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,480
hand over my master's body

875
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,030
and charge Zhong Xueman.

876
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,140
Yes, that's right.

877
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,630
Who called for
the Secret Investigation Unit?

878
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,830
Since only the Secret Investigation Unit
can investigate,

879
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,830
we might as well comply.

880
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
No wonder you are Constable Zhong.

881
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,730
You discovered the suspicious points

882
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,590
in General Huo's case so quickly.

883
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,550
It really surprised and delighted me.

884
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,110
Zhuge Kongyun is here.

885
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,400
If he discovers you,

886
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,840
it

887
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,710
will cause serious trouble.

888
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,850
What do you mean?

889
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,190
Indeed.

890
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,150
I discovered that General Huo's death

891
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,000
might be suspicious.

892
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,840
But due to the mourning period
at the Huo Mansion,

893
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,280
I asked Constable Zhong

894
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,340
to secretly investigate

895
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,610
General Huo's body.

896
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,160
Causing such a commotion

897
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,890
was due to my poor planning.

898
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,960
I

899
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,990
apologize to everyone from the Huo family.

900
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,440
The Secret Investigation Unit

901
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,500
would actually work with
the Elite Constabulary Unit?

902
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,070
Do I need you to teach me

903
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,290
how we should be doing things
at our Secret Investigation Unit?

904
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,190
That's right!

905
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,590
The Secret Investigation Unit

906
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,400
and the Elite Constabulary Unit
both belong to the Ministry of Justice.

907
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,670
We work closely together on a daily basis.

908
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,480
And now when facing a suspicious case,

909
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,010
we should be
even more united in our response.

910
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,710
Untie her now!

911
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,440
I think

912
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,280
the autopsy is almost done.

913
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,510
Constable Zhong.

914
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,000
Ask the people inside

915
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,400
to open the door.

916
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm helping you out of this situation,

917
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
so at least make it easier for me.

918
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
If we continue this standoff,

919
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,100
neither of us
will be able to explain ourselves.

920
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Constable Zhong,

921
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,960
please.
