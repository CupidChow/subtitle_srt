17
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,380

Although we failed to get the Fire Cicada,

26

30
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,840
By the way, Coroner Feng,

31
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,400
do you know the old man

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,020
we met in the Ghost Market?

33
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't.

34
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,630
Then why did he target us?

35
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,430
He...

36
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,840
The Ghost Market

37
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,300
is full of desperate criminals

38
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,000
and outlaws.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,960
Evil is second nature to them,

40
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,430
so nothing they do

41
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,890
should come as a surprise.

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,640
That's right.

43
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,650
He came straight in asking for

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,590
one of your eyes.

45
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,170

Trading your eye?

49
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,600
Have you lost your mind?

50
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,050
He did ask,

51
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,940
but it's not like

52
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,360
he really wanted my eye.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,760
are you absolutely sure
you don't know him?

55
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,040
I truly don't.

56
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,659
It's just I saw he was hiding poison

57
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,360
in his hand,

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
so I wanted to stop him.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
But my martial skills are too weak,

60
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,750
so I failed to stop him.

61

Fortunately, you arrived just in time.

Otherwise, today, we would've...

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
It's all my fault.

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,780
I shouldn't have taken you
to the Ghost Market.

65
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,510
I was the one who insisted on going.

66

Old Bug

What do you mean?

87
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,750

How do you prove it?

92
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,180
The reason

93
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,630
why I know about
the existence of red crystal

94
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,310
is that I clearly remember

95
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,570
its documentation in the Yin-Yang Book.

96

When will you teach me the Yin-Yang Book?

104

This acupoint causes slight pain.

105
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,920
Got it?

106
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,310
The reason why he killed my master

107
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,159
was to steal the Yin-Yang Book.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,750
But my Master

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,830
had already given

110
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,750
that book to me,

111
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,750
so Old Bug failed to get it.

112
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,530
So you're saying

113
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,070
the red crystal is connected to
the Poison Valley?

114
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,240
Since we found red crystal

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,510
in Huo Zongyao’s body,

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,750
I've been suspecting
it was related to Poison Valley.

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,950
But the process of
refining red crystal

118
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,000
is extremely complex,

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,510
achievable only by supreme experts.

120
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,160
Even I can't pull it off.

121
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,030
And in Poison Valley,

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,910
nowadays, only

123
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,670
Old Bug

124
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,800
can refine it.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,510
So Old Bug is very likely

126
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,560
connected to Yesha.

127
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,310
Old Bug is completely rotten,

128
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,000
capable of any evil deed.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,860
It's a pity that

130
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,560
he got away last night.

131
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,480
As long as he's still in the capital,

132
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,010
we have a chance to find him.

133
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,030
About your identity,

134
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,290
don't you plan to let them know?

135
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,370
Someone from Poison Valley

136
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,470
can't possibly be a good person.

137
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,820
Aren't you a good person yourself?

138
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,790
Not everyone

139
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,270
thinks like you do.

140
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,960
Trust between people

141
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,170
is naturally hard to establish

142
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,960
but easy to dissipate.

143
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,670
I don't want them to misunderstand.

144
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,130
As a friend,

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
I respect your decision.

146
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,030
But

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,670
you can't keep a secret forever.

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,840
If one day,

149
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,840
they discover your true identity,

150
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,310
the misunderstanding could be even worse.

151
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,690
Let me think about it some more.

152
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,600
Miss Huo, what's this about?

153
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
My mother was accused of a crime,

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,360
so her body was supposed to
be held for investigation.

155
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
Being able to bury her
before the investigation

156
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,480
was all thanks to
the Elite Constabulary Unit's help.

157
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Constable Zhong, if you refuse this meal,

158
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,200
I would feel terribly guilty.

159
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,960
The deceased deserve respect.

160
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,420
Miss Huo, you're too kind.

161
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,910
But I believe you didn't ask me

162
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,360
to come today

163
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,600
simply for a meal, right?

164
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,720
If there's something you want to say,
please go ahead.

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,840
There is something

166
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,200
I'd like you to take a look at,
Constable Zhong.

167
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
The Huo household's ledger?

168
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,360
This ledger

169
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,870
was previously managed by Mrs. Huo

170
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,000
and Li Xiao.

171
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,630
I've just taken over,

172
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,750
and while reviewing the accounts,

173
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,720
I discovered some peculiarities.

174
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,000
If there are issues with
the Huo household's accounts,

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,030
why come to me?

176
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,550
Every six months,

177
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,750
there's a large sum of money transferred
into the Huo household's account.

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,360
The money has been transferred

179
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,270
from Guangsha Villa in the suburbs.

180
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,870
But I've checked

181
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,400
all our family businesses,

182
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,480
and the Huo household and Guangsha Villa

183
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,200
have never had any

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,390
business dealings.

185
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,150
Guangsha Villa has no reason

186
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,000
to regularly give money to our household.

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,730
So I traced it back to the source

188
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,750
and examined years of
our household's accounts.

189
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,320
I found that the first transfer

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,050
was actually made 23 years ago.

191
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,120
23 years ago?

192
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,670
My mother told me before she died

193
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,200
that I was

194
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,360
brought back by my father
from the frontier that year.

195
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,000
Also, my mother once told me that

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Chu Guangsha, the owner of Guangsha Villa,

197
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,780
was once my father's personal guard.

198
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,600
Miss Huo.

199
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,080
Why are you telling me

200
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,150
all this?

201
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,200
My father is dead,

202
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,790
and so is my mother.

203
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,300
I want to uncover the truth
about my origins.

204
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,440
This is the only lead

205
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
I've been able to find so far.

206
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,440
Perhaps

207
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,720
Mr. Chu

208
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,580
can provide me with some answers.

209
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,200
But I don't know Mr. Chu,

210
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,930
and I know nothing about Guangsha Villa.

211
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,550
If I go there unannounced,

212
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,410
he might get suspicious of me.

213
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,360
Therefore,

214
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,840
I would like to ask you, Constable Zhong,

215
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,750
to help me uncover

216
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,810
my true identity as soon as possible.

217
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,570
[May 22nd:
Procurement of sacrificial offerings.]

218
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,710
[Training ground arena repairs.
Expense: 348 taels]

219
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,150
Two buns.

220
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,440
No problem.

221
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,390
Here you go.

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,030
Thanks a lot

223
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,720
for saving me yesterday.

224
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,870
I never thought

225
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,600
someone as timid and weak as you

226
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,660
would actually dare to go to a place

227
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,920
like the Ghost Market.

228
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I promised Beiming I would save him.

229
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
What I promised,

230
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,300
I'd accomplish
even if it might cost my life.

231
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,630
Do you think that crazy woman,

232
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,830
I mean, Zhong Xueman,

233
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,960
would really be willing to give up her eye

234
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,360
for the Fire Cicada?

235
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,190
That's a chance to save Beiming.

236
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,510
She surely won't give it up.

237
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,200
After everything

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,660
she did to Beiming before?

239
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
No ordinary people could understand

240
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,840
their relationship.

241
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,440
Let alone an eye,

242
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
even if it cost her life,

243
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,660
I don't think

244
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,030
she'd even hesitate.

245
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Coroner Feng.

246
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,670
Well,

247
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,150
I pushed you that day

248
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,940
and lost my temper with you.

249
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,390
Hit me back,

250
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,050
and we'll be even, okay?

251
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,930
If I hit you,

252
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,590
wouldn't I be the one in pain?

253
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,530
With all that

254
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,510
thick skin of yours,

255
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,910
how could I even hurt you?

256
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,960
Then use a knife.

257
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,000
No way.

258
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,720
You brute.

259
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,320
Stick with calling me Madman, will you?

260
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,150
I'm not used to

261
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,200
being called Coroner Feng.

262
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Madman.

263
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
That sounds much better.

264
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,840
I've checked the ledger carefully,

265
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
and the payments from Guangsha Villa
to the Huo household

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,480
indeed

267
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,080
started 23 years ago.

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
That year, General Huo Zongyao

269
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,200
had just returned from Haiya.

270
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,960
If Chu Guangsha

271
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,550
really was General Huo's personal guard,

272
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,840
then he must have been to Haiya too,

273
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,600
and would have just returned
from there as well.

274
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,260
But you don't know

275
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,790
Huo Dairong's intentions.

276
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,360
When we were investigating
the Huo Mansion case,

277
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
she deliberately led us to

278
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,510
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao,

279
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,200
and also intentionally revealed

280
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,550
such an important clue.

281
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,430
Was all that really just

282
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,550
to uncover the truth about her origins?

283
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,870
Whatever her purpose might be,

284
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,320
since it concerns Haiya,

285
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,050
we must get to the bottom of it.

286
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
I'll go with her.

287
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
You stay here

288
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,320
and wait for our news.

289
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,270
She knows your identity,

290
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,320
and if she intends to harm you...

291
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,480
Even if she wants to harm me,

292
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
I can't escape it anyway,

293
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,960
so I might as well face it head-on.

294
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,550
Perhaps

295
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,460
we can find a weakness in her plan.

296
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,690
[Qi]

297
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
Beiming. Constable Zhong.

298
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,600
I've asked around.

299
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,120
Chu Guangsha did serve in the military,

300
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,030
then he retired to civilian life

301
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,720
and somehow got

302
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,780
a large sum of money

303
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,630
to establish Guangsha Villa.

304
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,840
Over these years, Chu Guangsha
has been devoted to spiritual pursuits,

305
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,930
regularly associating
with the Immortal Masters

306
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,070
from Qingtai Mountain.

307
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,150
It's said he seeks immortality,

308
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,390
to cultivate and ascend.

309
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,600
Immortality?

310
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,550
Seems like he truly has attained
everything he wants.

311
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,350
Chu Guangsha was just a soldier,

312
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,150
yet he suddenly acquired
such a large fortune.

313
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,750
That money is highly suspicious,

314
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,120
definitely from questionable sources.

315
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,850
Whether he's man or ghost,
we'll know at a glance.

316
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go.

317
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,170
Beiming.

318
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,910
Aren't you going to wear a bamboo hat?

319
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,710
It's alright.

320
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,480
We're far from the capital now.

321
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,880
No one will recognize me.

322
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,510
Honored guests,

323
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,010
please come in.

324
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,240
May I ask, Sir,

325
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,150
what happy occasion

326
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,510
is Guangsha Villa celebrating today?

327
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,320
Don't you know?

328
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,360
The master is hosting a grand banquet
for his birthday.

329
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,720
Word is the Immortal Masters
from Qingtai Mountain

330
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,550
have developed

331
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,410
a rejuvenating immortality pill

332
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,030
and have personally brought it here

333
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,510
as a birthday gift for the master.

334
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,480
And the master

335
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
will take

336
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
this immortality pill himself
during the banquet.

337
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,960
We are also

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
just here to join the fun.

339
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,670
I won't say more.

340
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,810
I'm going in ahead.

341
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Thank you.

342
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,000
Rejuvenation?

343
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,180
Let's go in and see for ourselves.

344
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Honored guests, please come in.

345
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,320
Not even asking who we are?

346
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,380
Master has instructed

347
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
that today, no matter who it is,

348
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,390
anyone who passes through this gate

349
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,480
is an honored guest.

350
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,790
Your master is quite generous.

351
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,480
Aren't you worried

352
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,030
we're just here for free food?

353
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,200
You jest.

354
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,349
This is Guangsha Villa after all,
originating from the line

355
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,550
"If I had thousands of spacious houses,

356
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,200
I'd shelter all the poor scholars
under heaven, making them smile with joy."

357
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,890
Your master

358
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,710
truly is a warm-hearted person.

359
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,349
I've always told you to read more books.

360
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,150
What, feeling embarrassed now?

361
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,550
Guests,

362
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,880
please.

363
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,160
That's the young Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain

364
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,680
who came to deliver the pill
to our master.

365
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,400
Won't he stay for the banquet?

366
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,240
Well, these Immortal Masters

367
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,750
never stay long in mortal residences.

368
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,310
Being contaminated by worldly stuff

369
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,770
would affect their spiritual cultivation.

370
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,550
Guests,

371
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
please follow me.

372
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,590
This setup is no joke.

373
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,880
What is this thing?

374
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,940
This is
the Celestial Staircase Cloud Terrace.

375
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,350

something's off here.

Since we're already here,

383
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,400
we might as well enjoy the show.

finally make an appearance?

Be patient.

396
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,070
There are too many people at this banquet.

397
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,350
We can't risk alerting him.

398
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,070
Later,

399
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,750
we'll pay a private visit to Mr. Chu.

this immortality pill of his.

402
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,510
Medical books have never documented

403
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,110
any formula for rejuvenation.

404
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,720

I think

408
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,590
that Immortal Master
is just putting on airs.

Madman is really good,

510
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,150
spotted the issue immediately.

511
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,310
I found a large amount of red crystal

512
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,440
in the remnants of the pill

513
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
in Chu Guangsha's stomach.

514
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
I suspect that so-called immortality pill

515
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,240
is the source of the poison.

516
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,900
But Chu Guangsha's poisoning

517
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,070
differs from Huo Zongyao's

518
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,070
in several ways.

519
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,220
What's different?

520
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,340
Huo Zongyao's red crystal

521
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,960
was administered in

522
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,270
his health-preserving tea

523
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,720
in small amounts,
which was difficult to detect.

524
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,270
He consumed it for half a year,

525
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,960
resulting in chronic poisoning eventually.

526
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,030
But Chu Guangsha's situation is different.

527
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,720
His brain tissue

528
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,000
isn't riddled with holes

529
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,110
like Huo Zongyao's.

530
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,000
And his eyes, ears, and nose

531
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,350
contain large amounts of black blood.

532
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,310
This proves

533
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,440
he consumed a large amount

534
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,960
of red crystal in a short time,

535
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,750
ultimately dying
from brain tissue rupture.

536
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,810
So you're saying

537
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,480
someone wanted him dead today?

538
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,280
That's right.

539
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,110
We just tracked it down to Chu Guangsha,

540
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,110
and he died.

541
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,240
This can't be a coincidence.

542
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,000
But Madam Feng is already dead.

543
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,380
Who else could possibly know that

544
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,270
red crystal can cause hallucination
and get people killed?

545
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,720
Who else would have such poison?

546
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,030
That limping physician,

547
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,720
and also...

548
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,470
Huo Dairong.

549
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,510
Miss Huo?

550
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,920
How is that possible?

551
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,880
Even if she wanted to poison him,

552
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,640
s-she should have

553
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,590
avoided you all.

554
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,920
Why would she lead us there?

555
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,350
Wasn't that...

556
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,110
Wasn't that walking right into a trap?

557
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,790
Besides,

558
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,510
you said

559
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,030
she's an intelligent woman.

560
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,510
Would she do something so stupid?

561
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,510
It definitely wasn't Miss Huo.

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,030

has been determined.

How did he die?

569
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Just like your father,

570
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,330
he died from hallucinogenic poison.

571
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,200
How can it be such a coincidence?

572
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,460
I'll have to ask you about this, Miss Huo.

573
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,730
You suspect me?

574
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
That's fine.

the existence of this poison,

577
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,030
so it's natural for you to suspect me.

578
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,880
So what now?

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,790
Are you taking me to the

Everyone who knows about
this hallucinogenic poison

582
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
is a suspect.

583
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,960
We need to investigate each one of them

There's never been any mistake.

had poison in the pill in his stomach,

we're not suspecting you,

It's merely routine.

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,680
Do you have any remaining

625
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,640

626
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,720
I have some knowledge

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,580
about immortality pills myself.

This immortality pill

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,810
is the finest from the immortal realm.

630
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,920
It's nothing like what you'd find

631
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,350
in ordinary pharmacies
in the mortal world.

632
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,070
Moreover, this pill was obtained by me

633
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,160
sacrificing my own lifespan
and spiritual power,

634
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
requested from the immortal realm.

635
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,640
Therefore, once a pill is created,

636
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,200
the user

637
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,160
must take it within one day,

638
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,880
or it loses all efficacy.

639
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,070
So how could there be any

640
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,110
remaining pills?

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,240

that the poison in Mr. Chu's body

has nothing to do with you,

twist the truth

Please sit down.

673
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,640
Chu Guangsha took the pill

674
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,770
and died on the spot.

675
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,920
This matter has significant implications.

676
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,110
Respected Immortal Master, I believe you

677
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,070
wouldn't want rumors spreading out there,

678
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,070
claiming that Mr. Chu's death

679
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,110
is related to the pills
from Qingtai Mountain, right?

680
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
What this officer says

681
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,240
does make some sense.

682
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,240
However, as for the formula,

683
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,240
I still cannot let you have it.

687
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,880
However, I do have

688
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,360
a few defective pills in my possession.

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
the pill-making process

694
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,330
doesn't always go

695
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,350
smoothly.

696
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,720
If the heat, climate,

697
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,510
or the proportion of ingredients

698
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,640
is slightly off,

699
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,480
it will affect

700
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,210
the final efficacy of the pill.

701
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,960
Some poorly made immortality pills

702
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400

703
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,440
Given how profound our spiritual bond

704
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,480
with Mr. Chu was,

705
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,880
how could we possibly give

706
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,310
those defective pills to him?

707
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,480
Respected Immortal Master.

708
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,880
Actually, we just need to take a look at

709
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,400
the ingredients of the pill.

710
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000

[Jiu, Disciple of Qingtai Mountain]

You've always been the one
delivering the immortality pills, right?

721
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Or has anyone else handled them?

722
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,830
No.

723
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,550
After each immortality pill is made,

724
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,720
to preserve its immortal essence,

725
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,350
Master would put it

726
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,400
in a jade box

727
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
and then hand it to me.

728
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
After that, I'd deliver it
to Guangsha Villa.

729
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,510
I've always delivered the pills alone.

730
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,200
Absolutely no one else

731
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,960
has ever touched the pills.

732
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,720
And the person who received the pills,

733
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,110
was it Chu Guangsha himself,

734
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,170
or someone else from Guangsha Villa?

735
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,750
Of course it was Mr. Chu himself.

736
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,550
The immortality pills cannot be tainted
by mundane energy.

737
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,150
If ordinary people touch it,

738
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,880
the pills will be contaminated.

739
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,640
So it's always been

740
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,440
Mr. Chu who personally received it.

741
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,400
So you're saying

742
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,790
the only people who have touched

743
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,070
the immortality pills are
the Immortal Master,

744
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,480

745
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,830
No, no, Miss Huo.

746
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
I only deliver them.

747
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,660
I've never touched the pills.

748
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,160
Immortal Jiu, you're also a cultivator.

749
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,480
When delivering the pills,

750
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,510
weren't you ever curious

751
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,160
about what this immortality pill

752
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,480
that can transform a mortal
into an immortal

753
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
actually looks like?

754
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,650
I wouldn't dare.

755
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,270
After each pill is made,

756
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,480
Master would personally place it

757
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
in a jade box

758
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,270
and seal it with fire clay directly.

759
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,970
And he'd add his personal seal.

760
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,550
If I were to open it during delivery,

761
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,350
it would definitely be discovered.

762
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,350
No matter how curious I might be,

763
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,950
I wouldn't dare do anything.

764
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,000
The distance from Qingtai Mountain

765
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,590
to Guangsha Villa

766
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,790
isn't exactly short.

767
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,880
How did you deliver the pills,
Immortal Jiu?

768
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,960
By foot.

769
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,960
By foot?

770
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,280
That's right.

771
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,520
What you guys may not know is that

772
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,590
hardship

773
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,880
is the foundation of our

774
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,030
immortal cultivation practice.

775
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,440
So all disciples of our Qingtai Mountain,

776
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,110
no matter where they go,

777
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,880
can only rely on their own feet.

778
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,350
This is also to

779
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,790
show the immortals

780
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,440
our sincere devotion.

781
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,240
On foot?

782
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,000
How long does that take?

783
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,030
Noon is when the yang energy

784
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,240
is at its peak,

785
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,070
and also the best time

786
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,240
for the immortality pill to be completed.

787
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,350
And Jiu must arrive by 7 PM,

788
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,550
before the sun sets

789
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,190
and when yin and yang start to shift,

790
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,230
to deliver the immortality pill

791
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,440
to the recipient.

792
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,550
So the round-trip journey

793
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,320
has become

794
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,580
a path of cultivation for our disciples.

795
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,610
It's a difficult journey.

796
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Is there no place

797
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,120
to rest along the way?

798
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,960
The delivery of the pill was urgent.

799
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,889
I wouldn't dare rest along the way.

800
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,800
We have no further questions.

801
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,659
Thank you for your help,
Respected Immortal Master and Immortal Jiu.

802
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,320
After we finish examining
the defective pill,

803
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,580
we will provide you with an explanation.

804
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,550
What are you trying to do?

805
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,140
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

806
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,770
You're from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

807
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,200
What are you doing here
in the Ghost Market?

808
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,670
Nothing special.

809
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,670
I just need to ask you something.

810
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,590
Tell me the truth.

811
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,630
You'd better not go looking for trouble

812
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,830
when things are fine.

813
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,430
Young Master.

814
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,190
Got news about Zhong Xueman's whereabouts?

815
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,880
There's been a murder at Guangsha Villa.

816
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,630
Zhong Xueman and several other

817
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,070
constables from
the Elite Constabulary went there.

818
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,550
Guangsha Villa?

819
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,630
What murder?

820
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,550
I heard that the villa owner,
Chu Guangsha,

821
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,950
dropped dead during his birthday banquet.

822
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,680
Young Master.

823
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,000
Chief has ordered that

824
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,530
all members of
the Secret Investigation Unit

825
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,280
should focus entirely on investigating

826
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,670
leads about Yesha and Xiao Beiming

827
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,200
and ignore all other cases.

828
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,730
Besides, this case

829
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,400
is currently being handled by
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

830
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,070
There's no need to inform Chief
about this matter yet.

831
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,870
I'll take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

832
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,730
I have the results.

833
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
What did you find?

834
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,800
All that talk about
extending lifespan and spiritual power.

835
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,630
It's nothing but

836
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,510
ordinary tonics

837
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,570
mixed with mercury and yellow stone.

838
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,760
The one in Chu Guangsha's stomach

839
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,230
was at least made with red crystal,

840
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:09,920
but this one

841
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,440
doesn't contain any red crystal at all.

842
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,510
You mean

843
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,070
the pill developed by the Elder Immortal

844
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,840
and the one Chu Guangsha took
are different?

845
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,800
Exactly.

846
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,870
Now here's the strange part.

847
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,230
That young Immortal claims

848
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,760
he carried the pill with him
the entire time along the way,

849
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,590
and that he never

850
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,360
encountered anyone

851
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,880
or had contact with others.

852
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,670
If someone wanted to switch the pill,

853
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,200
how could they have done it?

854
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
That Immortal Jiu was lying.

855
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,030
Lying?

856
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
I noticed his expression

857
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,800
was indeed somewhat nervous,

858
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
but ordinary people

859
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
would naturally be nervous

860
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,800
facing interrogation from
the Elite Constabulary Unit, right?

861
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,730
He had other subtle movements too.

862
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,280
You mean his buttocks?

863
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,540
Not just his buttocks,

864
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,550
but also his hips.

865
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,630
He was injured,

866
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,230
and quite recently too.

867
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,510
What could he have been doing

868
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,310
to injure his hips and buttocks?

869
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,770
Horseback riding?

870
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,280
I also noticed that the skin

871
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,630
between his thumb and index finger
was swollen and inflamed,

872
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,920
suggesting he's not skilled at riding

873
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,000
and had been pulling on the reins
for a long time.

874
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,440
So that young Immortal
was indeed deceiving us.

875
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,280
He didn't follow

876
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,000
his master's instructions to travel
on foot as hardship cultivation at all.

877
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,590
He delivered the pill on horseback.

878
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,230
Riding a horse

879
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,670
to Guangsha Villa takes

880
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
much less time than walking.

881
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,440
During this time,

882
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,920
he could have done all sorts of things.

883
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,510
We should hurry to Qingtai Mountain then.

884
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,310
It'll be trouble if he gets away.

885
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,550
Where's Constable Zhong?
