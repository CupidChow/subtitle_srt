leaving him disabled.

but even granted him
a mansion and a title.

80
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,750
He also followed the marquis's suggestion

81
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,750
and gave him land

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,330
Sada just admitted

195
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,440
that Hu Shisan keeps records.

196
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
They must be hidden in this room.

197
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Constable Zhong,

198
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,630
take these girls
back to the Elite Constabulary Unit first

199
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,150
and report the case details.

200
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,840
Coroner Feng and I

201
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,870
will look for clues here.

202
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,200
See you back at the cave.

203
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
I think perhaps

204
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,390
I should take them back instead.

205
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,750
You don't know martial arts.

206
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,810
If they're intercepted on the way,
we'll be in trouble.

207
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,910
I'd better go.

208
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
Keep an eye on him for me.

209
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,780
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

210
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,870
To think that such things are happening

211
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,670
right under the Emperor's nose.

212
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,050
They're all witnesses.

213
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,200
The Blossom Skies case is significant.

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
I think we should

215
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,300
report this matter

216
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,120
to Chief Fang.

217
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,510
Senior,

218
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,200
I have one more favor to ask.

219
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,960
Xueman,

220
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,910
there's no need for formalities

221
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,750
between us.

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,150
Just say it and I'll do it.

223
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,670
They're all refugees from Nanyue.

224
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,750
After being trafficked,

225
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,720
they've suffered unimaginable torment.

226
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
After taking their statements,

227
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,910
please make arrangements.

228
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,610
If they still have family,

229
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,290
personally escort them home,

230
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,290
and if they have nowhere to go,

231
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
please

232
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,370
find them a way to survive.

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,670
Don't worry.

234
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,640
What are they doing?

235
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,790
If I'm not mistaken,

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
this is a Nanyue ritual

237
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,360
to give blessings to you

238
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,510
in gratitude.

239
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
We've searched everywhere

240
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,490
without finding anything.

241
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,320
Did Sada lie to us?

242
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,150
Thank you.

243
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,320
For what?

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
If it weren't for you

245
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
blocking that strike for me,

246
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,550
I would've died by that man's sword.

247
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,200
Thanks for saving my life, of course.

248
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
We're in this together now.

249
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
If you died,

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,150
it would affect the investigation.

251
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,360
Hey, you...

252
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,550
Never mind.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,850
I'll definitely repay you.

254
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,010
How do you plan to repay me?

255
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,990
I haven't figured it out yet,

256
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
but I will eventually.

257
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
I don't want to owe you.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,960
Thanks, Little White Dragon.

259
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,220
Listen, I'm telling you,

260
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,130
don't call me that name

261
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,000
in public.

262
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,840
Weird.

263
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,910
I've noticed

264
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,040
that you're becoming

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,250
more and more like a decent person.

266
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,440
Could it be

267
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,330
that you were actually framed?

268
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
What do you think?

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,270
Though you're a coroner,

270
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,200
you're also a registered constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

271
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,030
You should learn more from Constable Zhong

272
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,150
to remain skeptical

273
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,200
about everything

274
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,840
and not trust anyone easily.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,080
What if everything

276
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,150
I've been doing

277
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,680
was just to manipulate you?

278
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,910
Manipulate me?

279
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,030
Thinking about all that is tiring.

280
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,000
I only know

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,390
you saved my life,

282
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,810
so even if you're using me, it's worth it.

283
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,200
Besides,

284
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,240
I don't think Constable Zhong

285
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,170
distrusts you as much as you think.

286
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,170
What do you mean?

287
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,630
Look.

288
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,150
Just as you said,

289
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,850
she's suspicious

290
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,870
of everything.

291
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,750
She's afraid of losing sight of you,

292
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,910
so she keeps you chained up

293
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,080
for fear you might escape.

294
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
But that day when she found out

295
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,700
you took the wrong medicine and collapsed,

296
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,150
the way she panicked...

297
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,940
didn't look like someone

298
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,870
dealing with her father's killer.

299
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,150
Maybe she just feared that if I died,

300
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,950
the case would remain unsolved.

301
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Just like how

302
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
a corpse can't lie,

303
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,720
a living person

304
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
also can't fool themselves.

305
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
If she truly

306
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,630
doesn't believe in your innocence,

307
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,910
she would be doing everything

308
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,510
to find evidence

309
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,870
to lock you up in the Heavenly Prison,

310
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,030
instead of searching for

311
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,750
Hu Shisan

312
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,400
or Sada while carrying the charge

313
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,640
of harboring

314
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,700
a wanted criminal.

315
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,960
It's like she's grabbing onto a lifeline.

316
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,220
She's trying so hard to prove something.

317
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,010
What is she trying to prove?

318
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
You know better than I do, don't you?

319
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,150
About Sada's matter,

320
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,030
I still have questions.

321
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,760
I need you to help me

322
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,890
develop a medicine.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,270
Why are you here?

324
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,140
Constable Zhong,
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,110
What do you want?

326
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm here for someone.

327
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Who are you looking for?

328
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,830
Are you still trying
to hide it at this point?

329
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,680
This is not the Secret Investigation Unit.

330
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,350
This is not a place where you can

331
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,680
act however you please.

332
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,510
Do you know the punishment for harboring

333
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,590
a wanted criminal?

334
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,920
I never would have imagined

335
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,000
that you would hide him

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,060
right by your side.

337
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

338
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,310
Still not coming out?

339
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,210
Do you want to watch me die here?

340
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
Long time no see.

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,260
It's been three years.

342
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,720
I still won.

343
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,310
You—

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,830
Who are you?

345
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,640
I was about to ask you that!

346
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,180
Why'd you steal my hat?

347
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,730
Do you not have any at home?

348
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,750
You—

349
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,750
This is the new constable
from the Elite Constabulary Unit,

350
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,400
Tong Shuang.

351
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
And this is the son of the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

352
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,720
the top investigator of Qi Kingdom.

353
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,700
I just didn't expect

354
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,440
you'd be so interested

355
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,570
in his hat.

356
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,140
Playing tricks on me, are you?

357
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,040
Then what about these bloodstains

358
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,960
on the floor?

359
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,880
Has there been a murder here?

360
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,740
You'd better explain yourself clearly.

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,830
Mr. Zhuge, you have sharp eyes.

362
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,070
This is animal blood.

363
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,400
Recently,

364
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I've developed

365
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,310
a new type of medicine

366
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,830
that can nourish the kidneys.

367
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,640
However,

368
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,030
it requires a lot of animal blood

369
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,830
to produce

370
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,160
and it smells terrible.

371
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Only Constable Zhong

372
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,550
-allows me to produce it, so...
-Do you think I’ll believe

373
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,680
that story?

374
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,280
This is clearly human blood!

375
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,850
What are you doing?

376
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,240
Young Master!

377
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,750
Are you alright, Young Master?

378
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,920
Mr. Zhuge indeed has sharp eyes.

379
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,790
This is human blood.

380
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,680
However,

381
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,440
it's Constable Tong's blood.

382
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
A few days ago,
Constable Tong was feeling unwell,

383
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,110
so I gave him

384
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,750
this medicine,

385
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,030
which expelled some bad blood.

386
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,160
Seems like Young Master's health is poor.

387
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,830
Coroner Feng,

388
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,550
you should give him a few more pills.

389
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,240
This time is just a warning.

390
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,550
Next time you trespass into my home,

391
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,400
you won't just be

392
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
coughing up blood.

393
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,480
Slowly.

394
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Be careful.

395
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,590
That guy looks so effeminate,

396
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,270
wearing red clothes at night

397
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,550
like some kind of ghost.

398
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,480
What a hypocrite,

399
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,200
putting on such airs.

this place?

423
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,960
After that incident,

424
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,590
this place became known to be cursed

425
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
and lost all its business.

426
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,160
The owner later fell ill and died

427
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,640
and this loft was sold cheaply,

428
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,160
so I had Tong Shuang buy it.

429
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,350
I sealed the main entrance

430
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,880
and created a secret passage
for easy access.

431
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,220
In the entire capital,

432
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,380
there's probably no place

433
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,510

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,660
This is the name list

438

439
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,030
when those Saintesses were sold

440
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,270
and to which brothels

This dirty money

446
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,160
was earned with the blood and tears

447
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,240
of countless women.

448
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
Look at the last page.

449
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,200
Only this Hibiscus

450
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,400
[Hibiscus]

451
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,880
has no destination recorded.

452
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,070
There were five in total.

453
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,950
Four women

454
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,410
were all sold by Hu Shisan

455
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,270
and then redeemed later.

456
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,970
Then all four became victims
of the sewing murder.

457
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,480
Only Hibiscus wasn't sold.

458
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,240
This Hibiscus could very well be

459
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,680
the key to solving

460
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,080
the corpse-sewing case.

461
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,960
Hibiscus is obviously an alias.

462
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,640
There's not even a portrait of her.

463
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
How can we find her among the masses?

464
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,330
There's a place.

465
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,640
Officers,

466
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,950
are you letting me go?

467
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
My lady, why are you here?

468
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,720
I'm already locked up here,

469
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,480
and you still won't leave me alone.

470
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,960
My lady, I know I was wrong.

471
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Please spare me just this once.

472
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,680
Do you know a woman

473
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,750
named Hibiscus?

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,930
I don't know her.

475
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,890
Never heard of her.

476
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,510
Two months ago,

477
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,450
five women from Nanyue

478
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,240
were brought

479
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,720
to your boss Hu Shisan,

480
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
but only four of them were sold.

481
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,640
The remaining one was called Hibiscus.

482
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,830
Ring any bells now?

483
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,590
The boss said

484
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
we must get her back.

485
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,110
Otherwise,

486
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,550
all of us

487
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
will die.

488
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,720
I remember now.

489
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,200
There was one

490
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,310
who escaped at that time.

491
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,440
I led people to chase after her.

492
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
Where did she go after you caught her?

493
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,240
I handed her over to our boss, of course.

494
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,030
As for what our boss

495
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,830
did with her,

496
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
I have no idea.

497
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,030
Are you sure

498
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,720
Hibiscus wasn't among those women?

499
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,400
Yes.

500
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,640
We were the ones

501
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,750
who delivered those women

502
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,790
to the brothels.

503
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,830
Hibiscus definitely wasn't there.

504
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,030
Each sacrifice

505
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,550
has five Saintesses.

506
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,070
If the women who died

507
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,530
in the corpse-sewing case

508
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,680
were the Saintesses

509
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,210
sacrificed two months ago,

510
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,270
then could the remaining one

511
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,270
be the Tailor's

512
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,160
next target?

513
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,260
The Tailor uses the Four Devils Formation

514
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,720
and red clothes to curse the dead.

515
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
If he wanted to kill five people,

516
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,550
the Four Devils Formation
wouldn't make sense.

517
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,440
Either way,

518
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,240
we need to find out

519
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,570
that woman's identity.

520
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
We might find clues about Hu Shisan.

521
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,270
Tell me the address

522
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,930
of where you caught Hibiscus.

523
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,350
This is the place

524
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,880
the trafficker mentioned.

525
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,750
The house is so clean.

526
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,710
Someone must be living here.

527
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,530
There's a backyard.

528
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,210
[Dingfeng Pavilion]

529
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,110
Is the poison taking effect?

530
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,810
What's wrong with him?

531
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,480
Thanks to Coroner Feng's acupuncture,

532
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
I feel much better.

533
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,550
I think that Blood-freezing Frost

534
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,790
won't dare to harm me.

535
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,850
Did you find Hibiscus?

536
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,940
Hibiscus is already dead.

537
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,350
This must be a fresh grave.

538
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,160
Strange.

539
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,030
Who would put a grave

540
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,590
in their own backyard?

541
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,030
Look!

542
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,400
Hu Shisan was also sewn and murdered?

543
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,030
That's right.

544
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,480
The body was sent to
the Elite Constabulary Unit,

545
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,640
and the trafficker confirmed

546
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,480
it was Hu Shisan.

547
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,110
So there weren't just
four victims of sewing murder

548
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,240
but five.

549
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,550
What about Hibiscus?

550
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,030
How do you know she's dead?

551
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,160
That grave.

552
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,160
There were hibiscus flowers planted
in front of the grave.

553
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,200
Hibiscus flowers don't grow in Nanyue,

554
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,880
yet she called herself Hibiscus.

555
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
The hibiscus must have carried

556
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,960
a special significance for her.

557
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,030
So I deduce that

558
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,200
the hibiscus flowers
are Hibiscus's tombstone.

559
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,550
You dug open the grave?

560
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,830
There was a female corpse

561
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,270
that had been dead
for at least two months.

562
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,720
The body wasn't completely decomposed,

563
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,240
and the trafficker confirmed

564
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
the body was Hibiscus's.

565
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,030
The body showed

566
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,270
signs of beatings.

567
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,110
The cause of death was a fractured skull

568
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,510
from blunt force trauma.

569
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,310
The coroner's examination revealed

570
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,070
she was pregnant when she died.

571
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,040
These are the clothes
she never finished making.

572
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,510
What else did the trafficker say?

573
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,480
Two months ago,

574
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,550
after the sacrifice,

575
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,110
the five Saintesses

576
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,770
were sent to Hu Shisan's home.

577
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,200
Hibiscus once tried to escape.

578
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,590
How did Hibiscus escape?

579
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,830
And how did you

580
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,480
catch her again?

581
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,160
She just ran away secretly.

582
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,590
At first, we didn't know

583
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,400
where to look for her.

584
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,860
It was the other four girls

585
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
who told us where she went.

586
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,400
But the remaining four Saintesses

587
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,930
betrayed her whereabouts.

588
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,400
The traffickers went to Hibiscus's home

589
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,550
and took her back.

590
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,010
No one knows what happened

591
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,310
after that.

592
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,310
I believe that afterward,

593
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,000
Hu Shisan, in a fit of rage,

594
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,550
beat Hibiscus to death.

595
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,590
Then we're done for.

596
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,880
The trail has gone cold again.

597
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,070
Those responsible for Hibiscus's death

598
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,110
aren't just the four courtesans
and Hu Shisan,

599
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,270
but others as well.

600
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,110
Sada.

601
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,070
Sada?

602
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,750
Then we should have

603
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,440
gone after him

604
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,770
when we discovered him.

605
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,960
I know where he is.

606
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,960
Do you remember

607
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,350
what weapons
those two men in black

608
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,750
who kidnapped Sada used?

609
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,240
One used a mace. The other used a sword.

610
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Their techniques were brutal,
their skills profound.

611
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,650
They're definitely not nobodies.

612
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,510
They're the guards from
Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

613
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,000
Marquis Jingshan is also from Nanyue,

614
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,940
so his worship of Blossom Skies

615
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,680
is quite understandable.

616
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,570
But the fact that he sent

617
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,400
his two personal bodyguards

618
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
to rescue Sada

619
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,790
indicates their relationship

620
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,640
is far from ordinary.

621
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
I wounded one of those men in black

622
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,960
in the shoulder.

623
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,640
If we go to the marquis's mansion
to verify the wound,

624
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,790
we can prove the identity
of those men in black.

625
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,050
Then we can follow the trail to find Sada.

626
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,480
Where does a marquis in exile

627
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:50,260
[Marquis Jingshan's Mansion]

628
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,180
get all the money

629
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,550
to build such a grand mansion?

630
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,400
Marquis Jingshan must be connected

631
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
to Blossom Skies.

632
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,030
Did you find out
about his household's situation?

633
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,960
Yes, I did.

634
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,270
Marquis Jingshan has an only son

635
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,000
named Ajia.

636
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,750
He's in his early twenties
but is very mysterious.

637
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,160
They say he never leaves the mansion,

638
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,880
so very few people have seen him.

639
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,000
An only child, in his twenties,

640
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,000
rescued by personal guards...

641
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,310
This Ajia sounds a lot like Sada.

642
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
We'll find out once we investigate.

643
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,750
Let's make a stir.

644
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
This is all that Xueman

645
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
could find out.

646
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Come on.

647
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,880
Hurry up, I'm starving.

648
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,400
Isn't Zhong Xueman investigating

649
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,590
the corpse-sewing case?

650
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,790
Why is it about

651
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,750
Blossom Skies

652
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,480
and the Nanyue people now?

653
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,110
Chief,

654
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,830
the men patrolling reported

655
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,830
that they saw Xueman

656
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,360
heading toward Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

657
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Quickly, prepare my horse.

658
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
There's about to be trouble.

659
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,750
Let's go!

660
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,440
-Quickly.
-Let’s go.

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,720
Elite Constabulary Unit on duty.

662
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,960
I need to see the marquis.

663
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,110
Our lord is not home.

664
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,110
Please leave now.

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,290
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

666
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,640
This is a matter of life and death.

667
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,880
Please announce my arrival.

668
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,000
The lord isn't home.
Who should I announce to?

669
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,550
Leave.

670
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,410
Constable Zhong, be careful!

[Abundant Auspicious Omens]

672
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
Who are you?

673
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,350
How dare you trespass into
Marquis Jingshan's Mansion?

674
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,750
You've got some guts!

675
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,590
Don't you know

676
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,720
what place this is?

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,510
You two have such short memories.

678
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,160
We just fought last night.

679
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,110
[Abundant Auspicious Omens]

680
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

681
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Trespassing into the Marquis's mansion
is a capital offense.

682
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,440
Either surrender now

683
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,790
or you'll die here.

684
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,830
Come and get me if you can.

685
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,310
Stop!

686
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,760
Zhong Xueman,

687
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,510
what are you doing?

688
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,280
Do you know where you are?

689
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,200
Of course I do.

690
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,110
You know,

691
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,790
yet you still dare to cause trouble?

692
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,880
I'm just investigating a case.

693
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,010
You're investigating Blossom Skies.

694
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,940
But even if Blossom Skies

695
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,400
is connected to the Nanyue people,

696
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,460
you should realize

697
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,410
this is the marquis's mansion.

698
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,550
Blossom Skies uses sacrifices as a cover

699
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,550
to traffic Nanyue refugees.

700
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,070
The four victims in the corpse-sewing case

701
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,000
were all Saintesses
chosen by Blossom Skies.

702
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And among all the Nanyue people,

703
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,110
the only one with such power

704
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,310
is Marquis Jingshan,

705
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,680
so I suspect that Blossom Skies's leader

706
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,510
Sada

707
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,240
is hiding within this mansion.

708
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,830
You say Blossom Skies's leader

709
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,160
is hiding in Marquis Jingshan's Mansion?

710
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,160
Do you have any evidence?

711
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,790
I caught Sada last night,

712
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,980
but he was rescued by two men in black.

713
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,340
It's these two right here.

714
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,670
Is this true?

715
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,590
We are

716
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,320
Marquis Jingshan's personal guards.

717
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,710
We never leave his side for even a moment.

718
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,909
How could we possibly rescue this Sada?

719
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,449
Complete nonsense.

720
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,440
When you two fought with me
the night before,

721
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,110
one of you

722
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,320
was wounded by my Bi'an Sword

723
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,280
on the shoulder.

724
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,960
We can verify the wound right now.

725
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,320
If there's no wound,

726
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,710
I'll admit my crime and accept punishment.

727
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,030
If there is a wound,

728
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,590
it proves I'm telling the truth.

729
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,230
Then please immediately tell me

730
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,710
where Sada is hiding.

731
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,030
This seems quite reasonable.

732
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,030
If you have nothing to hide,

733
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,290
why not remove your clothes and prove it?

734
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,000
Do you need

735
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,780
the Elite Constabulary Unit
to do it for you?

736
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,800
Wait.

737
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,880
My Lord.

738
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,090
Greetings, Marquis Jingshan.

739
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,880
I find what you were just discussing

740
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,000
quite interesting.

741
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,190
Blossom Skies,

742
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,690
corpse-sewing case...

743
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,450
Though I don't understand it all,

744
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,440
since the Elite Constabulary Unit

745
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,880
suspects someone from my household

746
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,440
is involved with the criminals,

747
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,800
then I cannot

748
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,400
remain uninvolved.

749
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,080
Please forgive us, My Lord.

750
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,530
These are merely
our subordinates' speculations.

751
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,320
It's fine.

752
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,030
My mansion

753
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,100
also values our reputation and dignity.

754
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,080
Since this female constable

755
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,480
wants to see evidence,

756
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,480
you two should remove your clothes

757
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,360
and let her see.

758
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,800
Yes.

759
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,550
You deliberately did this

760
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,550
to cover up evidence.

761
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,590
We practice martial arts daily

762
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,630
to improve our skills.

763
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,630
Injuries during sparring are inevitable,

764
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,920
so having some wounds

765
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,230
is perfectly normal.

766
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,070
Chief Fang, what do you think?

767
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,590
My Lord,

768
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,710
the wounds on their bodies

769
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,280
indeed don't count as evidence.

770
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,670
Wait.

771
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,150
Does this constable
have any other thoughts?

772
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,890
I want to search
Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

773
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,510
I don't want to trouble you

774
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,280
over a small misunderstanding.

775
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,140
After all, rumors can be damaging

776
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,150
and you care so much
about your reputation.

777
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,670
If you have nothing to hide

778
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,800
and is certain this case
has nothing to do with your household,

779
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
why not let us conduct a search?

780
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,280
Then if there are any rumors,

781
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,710
the Elite Constabulary Unit

782
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,670
can also testify to your innocence.

783
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,480
How dare you!

784
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,800
Do you think my mansion

785
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
can be searched at your whim?

786
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,840
It's not just the Elite Constabulary Unit.

787
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,630
Without His Majesty's imperial decree,

788
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,280
even the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

789
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,740
cannot act so recklessly.

790
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,400
Zhong Xueman,

791
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,800
stand down!

792
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,320
My Lord, if that's the case,

793
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,550
let me be clear.

794
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,590
If this were just about Blossom Skies,

795
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,840
we certainly wouldn't dare to
trespass on your mansion.

796
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,670
But this matter
has far-reaching implications

797
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,630
and may be connected to

798
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,070
the Yesha case from three years ago.

799
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,340
The Yesha case is of great importance

800
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,230
to His Majesty.

801
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,360
If the culprits escaped

802
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,840
because of your deliberate obstruction,

803
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,500
you wouldn't be able to handle

804
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,670
His Majesty's wrath easily

805
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,020
even if you were from the royal family,

806
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,420
let alone as a foreigner.

807
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,950
I urge you to reconsider.

808
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,510
Report!

809
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,440
My Lord,

810
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,630
terrible news, terrible news,

811
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,760
the Young Master...

812
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,290
What's the panic about?

813
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,280
I wonder if the Elite Constabulary Unit

814
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
might be able to help

815
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,360
the marquis now?

816
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,880
Is Ajia

817
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
in trouble again?

818
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,110
The Young Master has gone missing,

819
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,880
and there's blood in the courtyard.

820
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,630
What?

821
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,030
Yitie,

822
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,920
take men to investigate
the back courtyard immediately.

823
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,400
Yes.

824
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,360
Hurry!

825
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,990
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

826
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Who was the last person
to see the Young Master?

827
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
It was me.

828
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,880
I was the last to see
the Young Master last night.

829
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,590
At that time, he was with several maids,

830
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,280
enjoying himself in the pavilion,

831
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,400
and wouldn't let us in.

832
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,590
This morning when I came

833
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,670
to serve the Young Master his meal,

834
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,670
I saw blood all over the floor

835
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,000
as soon as I entered,

836
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,480
and the Young Master was gone.

837
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,880
Bunch of useless fools!

838
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,480
Weren't you supposed to watch over him?

839
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,400
Go find him now!

840
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:14,930
Yes, sir.

841
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,670
Yes, sir.

842
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,150
My Lord.

843
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,760
The criminals must have injured

844
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
the Young Master before taking him away.

845
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,820
The Elite Constabulary Unit
needs to seal off

846
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,150
the entire Marquis Jingshan's Mansion

847
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,360
to see if we can find

848
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,550
any clues about his disappearance.

849
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,510
Fine, I'll listen to you.

850
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,400
Whatever methods
the Elite Constabulary Unit uses,

851
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,460
I don't care.

852
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,760
I just hope you'll do everything possible

853
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,710
to rescue my son.

854
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,100
Rest assured, My Lord.

855
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,100
Seal off Marquis Jingshan's Mansion!

856
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,590
Yes.

857
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

858
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,550
Search thoroughly.

859
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,230
Don't miss any corner.

860
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
Report immediately if you find anything.

861
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,320
Yes, sir.

862
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,890
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

863
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,670
I've already made inquiries.

864
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,030
Young Master Ajia likes to spend time here

865
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,920
to indulge in pleasure,

866
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,110
and he also enjoys

867
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,480
playing hide-and-seek

868
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,880
with the maids here.

869
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,670
Where are the maids?

870
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,960
They were all drugged unconscious.

871
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,140
There were no other findings.

872
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,960
Judging from the blood trail,

873
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Ajia must have been taken

874
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
from here.

875
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,960
Not much blood. Likely non-fatal.

876
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,500
I found something!

877
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,550
What did you find?

878
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,030
I discovered this piece of coarse cloth

879
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,550
on these thorny bushes.

880
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,510
I suspect it was torn from the culprit's

881
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,110
pant cuff when they were abducting

882
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,190
Young Master Ajia and got caught

883
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,450
on these sharp thorns.

884
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,400
It has a rusty smell.

885
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
It also smells of salt.

886
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,030
Therefore, I suspect

887
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,710
the culprit frequently visits a place

888
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,590
where large amounts

889
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,960
of salt and iron are stored.

890
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,400
But ordinary households

891
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,660
all have salt and iron.

892
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,150
These thorns are so low.

893
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,440
The cloth must have been torn

894
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,100
from the culprit's pant cuff.

895
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,440
Who would leave salt containers
and iron tools

896
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,840
scattered on the ground?

897
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,320
It's more likely a warehouse
storing salt and iron.

898
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,480
In Qi Kingdom, salt and iron
are state-controlled.

899
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,540
There's only one place in the capital

900
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,590
that would have a warehouse

901
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,630
storing such large quantities
of salt and iron.

902
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,430
The Western Salt and Iron Works.

903
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,150
Elite Constabulary Unit, assemble!

904
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,320
To the Salt and Iron Works!

905
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,280
Have our men follow them.

906
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,230
Yes, sir.

907
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,510
Hurry, quick!

908
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,150
Coroner Feng.
