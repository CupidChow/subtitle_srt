[Morgue, Elite Constabulary Unit]

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,590
In the third year of Xingwen,

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,710
when the Secret Investigation Unit
had not yet been formed,

6
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,509
I was full of passion

7
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,090
to uphold justice

8
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,710
and joined

9
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,170
the Elite Constabulary Unit
as a constable.

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,690
At that time,

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,750
there was a serial murder case.

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
These are

14
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,970
the portraits of the three dead women?

15
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,510
Rookie,

16
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,140
are you fooling us?

17
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,110
What are you drawing now?

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
The murderer.

19
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,730
You've seen him?

20
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,680
No.

21
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,650
Then how can you

22
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,180
draw him in such detail?

23
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,890
Based on the wounds on the bodies

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,030
and Deputy Chief Zhong's

25
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,320
deduction of the killer...

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,160
The knife was thrust upward
from the lower right

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,079
into the heart.

28
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,920
These three

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
victims whose faces were skinned

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
were all female.

31
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,340
If the killer

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,079
were taller than them,

33
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,510
or even about their height,

34
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,110
the angle of the stab wound

35
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,550
wouldn't be like this.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,670
In other words,

37
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,600
this killer is very likely

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,510
much shorter than the victims.

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,970
The killer is a shortie.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,110
Also, considering

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,320
the victims' bone structure

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,790
and the killer's face-skinning behavior,

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,250
I drew it as my assumption.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,990
Assumption?

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,620
You can draw him just from an assumption?

46
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,890
As violent as the murderer is,

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
he must harbor immense resentment.

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,920
And these women's faces

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,079
were all very beautiful.

50
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,510
He skinned their faces

51
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,480
to destroy that beauty,

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,360
venting his hatred.

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,640
So the killer's face

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,760
has likely caused him

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,200
great suffering.

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
He must've led a miserable life

57
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,670
without respect,

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,079

66
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,040

195
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,490
draw what a child would look like
after growing old.

196
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,710
If I help you pass on this portrait

197
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,590
to my father,

198
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,590
he'll definitely get to the bottom of it.

199
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,520
If he finds out

200
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,680
our secret communication,

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,850
it will only cause more trouble.

202
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,000
Even in the best-case scenario

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,530
where he doesn't ask anything

204
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,560
and draw

205
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,860
what Miao Yun looks like now,

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,140
just a few of you

207
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,270
couldn't possibly find the man

208
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,590
in this portrait within several days.

209
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,170
So I wasn't planning to ask you

210
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,430
to turn to your father.

211
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,500
Then what do you want?

212
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,680
Father.

213
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,730
Come in.

214
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,490
Why are you here again?

215
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,330
Father,

216
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,290
after careful consideration,

217
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,230
I think there's something

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,450
I must say.

219
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,510
Go ahead.

220
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,860
King Zhong of Constables

221
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,330
spent his whole life
doing righteous things.

222
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,010
When he let you leave back then,

223
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,750
could it have been for your own good?

224
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,830
Nonsense.

225
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,670
You suffered from such a disaster

226
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,470
and kept a low profile for years.

227
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,990
His Majesty formed
the Secret Investigation Unit,

228
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,100
such an important institute,

229
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,770
and the Ministry of Justice
recommended several candidates.

230
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,260
Haven't you ever wondered

231
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,170
why this position

232
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,370
was given to you?

233
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,850
What are you trying to say?

234
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,140
I found this
from the Imperial Secretariat,

235
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,670
which records discussions

236
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,010
between His Majesty
and King Zhong of Constables

237
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,010
before the establishment

238
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,940
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

239
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,330
After reading it,

240
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,040
you might have a different perspective.

241
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,630
[His Majesty said, "Zhuge Tong was not
recommended by the Ministry of Justice.]

242
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,350
Zhuge Tong?

243
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,100
But the Ministry of Justice

244
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,750
doesn't have this person

245
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,150
on their submitted list.

246
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,340
Zhong,

247
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,050
why do you

248
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,770
recommend him?

249
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
Your Majesty,

250
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,670
the Secret Investigation Unit will

251
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,050
not only work
with the Elite Constabulary Unit

252
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,600
to handle major cases in the capital

253
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,240
but also be responsible
for monitoring officials

254
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,050
and protecting the imperial family.

255
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,450
The position of its Chief

256
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,270
requires not only meticulous thinking

257
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,530
and insight into human nature,

258
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,800
but also

259
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,840
a loyal and resolute heart.

260
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,270
I firmly believe

261
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,740
there is no one more suitable

262
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,390
than Zhuge Tong.

263
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,940
I've heard

264
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,340
that Zhuge Tong
was previously harmed by villains,

265
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,410
left disabled and blind,

266
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,310
no longer as capable as before.

267
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,310
Can he truly fulfill
such a weighty responsibility?

268
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,310
Your Majesty,

269
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,070
he worked with me for years.

270
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,390
I know him well.

271
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
His abilities

272
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,980
can never be undermined
by his physical disabilities.

273
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,100
In terms of insight into human nature

274
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,210
and strategic foresight,

275
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,910
of all the people I've known in my life,

276
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,100
none can outshine him.

277
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,820
["Tong's talent even dwarfs mine."]

278
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,510
Even I pale

279
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,880
in comparison to him.

280
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,980
The Ministry of Justice reported

281
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,790
that you had already removed Zhuge Tong

282
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,910
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

283
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,820
If he is truly as capable

284
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,670
as you claim,

285
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,030
why did you let him go?

286
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,580
This is a misunderstanding.

287
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,270
A misunderstanding?

288
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,670
I never doubted his abilities,

289
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,510
nor did I intend to dismiss him.

290
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,960
But since I succeeded

291
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,310
as Chief of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

292
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,460
I've made too many enemies.

293
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,550
He is my closest friend,

294
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,980
and he's already disabled.

295
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,310
If I placed him in danger again

296
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,670
and something happened to him,

297
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,330
I could never forgive myself,
not even in death.

298
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,550
You were trying to protect him?

299
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,080
I intended

300
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,430
to keep him away from chaos temporarily

301
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,340
to calm him down

302
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,910
and then talk things through.

303
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,220
Unfortunately, at that time,

304
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,550
with his physical injuries

305
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,860
messing up his emotions,

306
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,270
I failed to have a proper conversation
with him in time,

307
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,030
leading to his deep grudge against me

308
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,130
and resulting in today's situation.

309
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,150
Now I see.

310
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,710
Your Majesty,

311
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
I pledge my life as a guarantee

312
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,550
that Zhuge Tong will not
betray your trust.

313
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,700
If he cannot fulfill his duties

314
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,340
as the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

315
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,340
I will bear the punishment
for deceiving you.

316
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,550
I beg you, Your Majesty,
to grant Zhuge Tong

317
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,670
another chance to prove his worth.

318
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,800
No way.

319
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,240
Absolutely impossible.

320
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,870
If this were true,

321
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,510
why wouldn't he have told me in person?

322
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,280
Because my master said

323
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,030
you were too proud.

324
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,190
If you had known it,

325
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,030
you would have seen it as sympathy
and rejected it for sure.

326
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,550
If you continued to hide away back then,

327
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,300
it'd be a loss

328
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,100
to the imperial court
and the entire Qi Kingdom.

329
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,910
So he never told you.

330
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,310
Guards.

331
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,280
Guards!

332
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,980
Father,

333
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,510
before I came in,

334
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,880
I had already dismissed

335
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,790
all the guards outside.

336
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
Foolish!

337
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,950
How dare you?

338
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,670
Father.

339
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,310
Make way!

340
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,190
Kongyun.

341
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Chief Zhuge,

342
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,670
I came to see you today

343
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,180
with no intention to resist,

344
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,010
nor any thought of escape.

345
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,310
What do you want?

346
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,540
I want you to make a decision.

347
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
A decision?

348
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,990
I understand your prejudice

349
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,390
against me and my master.

350
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,100
My master rarely got drunk,

351
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,630
but on those few occasions,

352
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,030
he would talk to himself,

353
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,550
saying he owed you an apology.

354
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,190
He was waiting for a chance

355
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,650
to bring some wine, invite you

356
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,270
to the lakeside where you first met,

357
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,030
and apologize to you properly.

358
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,610
Unfortunately, my master

359
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
wouldn't have that chance anymore.

360
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,190
You came to see me

361
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,310
just to talk about

362
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,210
these old stories?

363
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,370
Haven't you always wanted to know

364
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,020
why Chief Fang

365
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,280
risked his life

366
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,540
to free me?

367
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,310
If you wish,

368
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,560
I can tell you

369
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,380
everything

370
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,620
I know.

371
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,320
But once you know the truth,

372
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,620
your life

373
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,400
will no longer be in your hands.

374
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,880
If you choose not to hear me out,

375
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,780
I'll place my life at your mercy.

376
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,320
You can arrest me or kill me

377
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,150
as you like.

378
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,820
Yun,

379
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,980
did you already know

380
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,770
what he's going to say?

381
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,730
Is that why

382
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,150
you've been openly

383

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,580
He's a starving beggar

574
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,980
with mental disability.

575
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,860
So it was normal for him

576
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,990
to eat that much without spitting it out.

577
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,620
No.

578
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,550
You got it.

579
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,420
Only a normal person would think about

580
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,310
how to act more like a fool.

581
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,620
If he had spit it out,

582
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,900
he might actually be a real fool.

583
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,820
But he forced himself

584
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,750
to swallow it,

585
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,020
which is suspicious.

586
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,110
He's faking it?

587
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,710
I'll go expose him right now.

588
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,170
If he's really pretending

589
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,510
and has been doing so for years,

590
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,840
he's really something.

591
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,070
We need to make him

592
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,530
expose himself publicly.

593
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,510
I have an idea.

594
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,660
Thirsty?

595
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,520
Here you are.

596
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,120
Drink this sweet soup.

597
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,340
Not enough?

598
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,840
I'll get you another bowl.

599
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,950
It worked so fast!

600
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,350
Did I put too much drug in?

601
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,660
Who are you?

602
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,660
You...

603
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,710
Yun,

604
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,750
don't you recognize me?

605
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,900
Godfather?

606
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,750
Weren't you already...

607
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,120
Did you betray me?

608
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,070
I didn't!

609
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,860
I didn't.

610
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,030
Really?

611
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,660
Really!

612
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,270
They all think I'm a fool.

613
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,550
N-No one would notice me.

614
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,860
You're lying!

615
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,140
-How dare you attack me?
-I dare not!

616
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,340
I dare not do it again!

617
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,710
I'm fed up with this filthy mask.

618
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,470
Miao Yun,

619
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,600
shall we have a talk now?

620
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm not the man

621
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,550
you're looking for,

622
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,790
I have nothing to do with him!

623
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,180
You know

624
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,270
who we're looking for?

625
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,030
Yesha.

626
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,030
Yesha.

627
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,580
Miao Jie was Yesha.

628
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,860
He's already dead.

629
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,620
What was the purpose

630
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,200
of building this secret chamber?

631
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,420
Killing.

632
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,520
I killed many, many people.

633
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,900
Since I was a child,

634
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,330
he would bring many

635
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
condemned prisoners out of nowhere

636
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,670
to this place

637
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,430
and make me fight them.

638
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,910
The scars on my body

639
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,700
and the wounds on my legs

640
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
were all caused by it.

641
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,140
Did he tell you anything?

642
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,900
Haiya.

643
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,980
He said that we all came from Haiya,

644
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,310
while the Qi Kingdom

645
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,820
destroyed everything we had,

646
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,990
and we survived

647
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,030
all for revenge on the Qi Kingdom.

648
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,620
So you're the second Yesha?

649
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,230
No, I'm not.

650
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,310
I'm not.

651
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,900
But...

652
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,140
But you could say I once was.

653
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,550
"Once was"?

654
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,880
What does that mean?

655
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,230
Miao Jie said

656
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,660
I would eventually take over

657
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,060
Yesha's mission one day.

658
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,380
So he kept forcing me

659
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,910
to learn various methods

660
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,310
of killing and committing crimes.

661
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,180
But I never wanted revenge,

662
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,640
nor did I want to get myself killed.

663
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,550
I just want to live my life.

664
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,950
Later,

665
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
there was a time

666
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,400
when I caught a cold.

667
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,860
My son has had a high fever for days,

668
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,990
remaining unconscious

669
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,320
and babbling nonsense.

670
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,510
I see.

671
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,470
I'll return and think of another solution.

672
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,070
Okay.

673
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,470
This way, please.

674
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,790
I used the lasting high fever

675
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,580
to pretend I'd become mentally impaired.

676
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,100
Could you really fool him
with your tricks?

677
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,450
I had no better option.

678
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,550
I was scared too!

679
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,340
Only I know

680
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,310
how cruel he truly was.

681
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,730
If he had found it out,

682
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,860
he would have definitely killed me.

683
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,660
But he didn't kill you.

684
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,710
Indeed.

685
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,230
Perhaps

686
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,820
he was also afraid
of bringing trouble upon himself.

687
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,750
Or maybe

688
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,540
he never discovered the truth.

689
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,350
I kept up the act for a while,

690
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,340
and then he had someone

691
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,070
send me to the Cixin Orphanage.

692
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,070
Later, I seized a chance

693
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,340
to escape from there.

694
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,240
You already made your escape,

695
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,400
so why didn't you run farther away?

696
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,030
Staying in the capital,

697
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,550
weren't you afraid he'd find you?

698
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,150
If he wanted, he could find me

699
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,660
even if I fled to the ends

700
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,790
of the world.

701
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,860
Only by hiding in the capital

702
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,180
could I diminish his threat.

703
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,620
Yet three years ago,

704
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,620
I heard that he died at Fengbo Lake.

705
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,780
I also heard

706
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,340
that Xiao Beiming was Yesha

707
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,380
and was on the run.

708
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,370
I don't know

709
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,890
what exactly happened.

710
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,920
I was afraid you were

711
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,610
in cahoots with him

712
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,940
and would come after me.

713
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,420
Back then,
constables from both units in the capital

714
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,750
were all hunting for me.

715
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
You still felt the capital was safe,

716
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,180
so you simply disguised yourself
as a beggar

717
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,240
and have been hiding here ever since.

718
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,900
How clever.

719
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,040
Now I've told you

720
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,290
everything I know.

721
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,230
I can testify for you

722
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,840
that Miao Jie was Yesha.

723
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,080
I can testify for you.

724
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,050
I'm really not

725
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,470
the person you're looking for.

726
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,320
I swear I have

727
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,870
nothing to do with all this!

728
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Take him back and lock him up for now.

729
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,990
Let's go.

730
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,070
Judging from his reaction,

731
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,470
he was probably not lying.

732
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,550
He truly doesn't have
Yesha's capabilities.

733
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,210
His confession and that secret chamber

734
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,170
can both prove

735
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,820
that Miao Jie was Yesha.

736
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,300
Using this evidence,

737
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,139
could we

738
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,400
acquit you and Chief Fang of the charges?

739
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,550
It's not enough.

740
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,389
Before we find the new Yesha,

741
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,300
all deductions remain speculation.

742
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,100
Putting aside whether

743
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,429
Chief Fang and I can be exonerated,

744
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,179
revealing those things about Haiya

745
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,710
can only make the situation
more precarious.

746
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,730
But we're running out of time.

747
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,550
I can persuade His Majesty

748
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,659
to postpone the execution,

749
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,219
but if

750
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,070
there's no new evidence or leads,

751
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,659
the Elite Constabulary Unit

752
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,590
still can't escape this disaster.

753
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,580
Chief Zhuge,

754
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,380
could you arrange

755
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,350
a cell for me

756
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,429
with all the dossiers

757
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,620
related to the Yesha case?

758
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,739
What are you planning to do?

759
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,739
I need to think

760
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:49,739
and clear my mind.

761
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,620
I feel like

762
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,550
