[Honored for Seniority and Virtue]

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,950
Get medicine
according to this prescription.

5
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,000
Within half a month,

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,259
Madam's health will certainly improve.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,120
You're so kind, Mr. Feng.

8
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,789
I don't know how to repay you.

9
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,920
Miss Huo, it's nothing.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,979
No need to repay me.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
The bond between you and Madam

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,590
is truly touching.

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,790
It's my honor

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
to treat her.

15
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,560
You two talk.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll go out.

17
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,670
Well? Did they confess?

18
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,190
They admitted to killing Xue Qianshan

19
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,520
but denied involvement

20
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,960
in General Huo's death.

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,710
That woman had an affair with Li Xiao.

22
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,170
If my father had found out,

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
she'd have been dead.

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,560
Besides,

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,079
she was in charge of the pharmacy,

26
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,710
which gave her
the best opportunity to do it.

27
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,310
Miss Huo, you do know a lot,

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
but not everything.

29
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,310
Actually, General Huo knew

30
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,400
about their relationship

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,150
and signed the divorce agreement
with Mrs. Huo.

32
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,560
But before they could leave,

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
General Huo passed away.

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,880
Divorce agreement?

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,310
Why would my father divorce her?

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,360
Mrs. Huo confessed.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,079
She said General Huo

38
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,520
was infertile.

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,060
So…

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,590
General did have a hidden illness.

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,870
But that was

42
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,750
after I gave birth to Dairong.

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,130
Dairong is indeed

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,690
General's and my daughter.

45
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,150
I see.

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,560
Constable Zhong,
I think you've misunderstood.

47
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,870
We've discovered that General Huo's death

48
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,280
may be connected to an incident

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,810
that happened 23 years ago.

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,260
You once said

51
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,430
you'd just entered the household
at that time.

52
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,630
Did General Huo ever mention anything?

53
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,360
Managing the pharmacy isn't hard proof.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Besides,

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,150
there are many ways to poison someone.

56
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you implying, Constable Xiao?

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,710
I heard Madam Feng once acquired
some wellness tea

58
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,360
for General Huo from a famous physician.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,420
Is there

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,570
any of that tea left?

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,970
You can't find evidence

62
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,170
to convict those two,

63
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,560
so you're suspecting my mother and me?

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Miss Huo, you're a smart girl,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,310
and you know who I am.

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,710
You should understand

67
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,560
that solving a case means

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,870
ruling out every possibility.

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,710
Besides,

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,320
don't you want to prove your innocence?

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,150
I understand.

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,070
Please wait a moment.

73
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll go get it now.

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,120
You don't trust me?

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,790
General never told me about matters

76
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,120
outside the household.

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
I don't know anything.

78
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,480
Even if I did hear something,

79
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,159
it's been so long—

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,030
I've already forgotten.

81
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,720
Madam Feng,

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
this matter is very serious.

83
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,310
It concerns not only General Huo

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
but everyone still living,

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,510
especially Miss Huo.

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,240
If you recall anything,

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
please let me know.

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,950
Alright.

89
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm a bit tired.

90
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,750
If there's nothing else,

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,360
please leave.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,720
Alright.

93
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,870
Take care.

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,400
[Cassia seed, burdock root,
mulberry fruit, dandelion…]

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
This is the wellness tea bag

96
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,900
[Mulberry leaf, polygonatum,
poria, and honeysuckle.]

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
and its recipe.

98
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,380
You may have them examined.

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,830
Thank you.

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,510
Is there anything else?

101
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,159
No. Sorry to bother you.

102
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,190
How did it go on your end?

103
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,750
Madam Feng's reaction was unusual.

104
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,440
Our speculation

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,500
is likely correct,

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,830
but she is hiding something

107
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,560
and wouldn't reveal anything.

108
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,920
Some things can't be hidden

109
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,680
no matter how hard you try.

110
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,270
Feng Qingzhuo,

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,200
take this tea bag for examination.

112
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,630
I'll stay
and keep watching the Huo family.

113
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,240
Okay.

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,270
Coroner Feng said

115
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,750
as long as you keep taking it,

116
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,120
you'll be fine soon.

117
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Did they give you a hard time?

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,040
They just did their job

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
and asked some questions.

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't worry, Mother.

121
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,040
Mother,

122
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,870
what's wrong?

123
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,400
Did Constable Zhong give you trouble?

124
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,070
No.

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,750
Dairong,

126
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,950
let's go out for a walk.

127
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,360
Sure.

128
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,159
I'll help you to the courtyard.

129
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,950
No.

130
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,360
I want to take you out of the Huo Mansion,

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
out of the capital.

132
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,360
Out of the capital?

133
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,880
Mother, where's this coming from?

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,760
So many things
have happened with the Huo household,

135
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,680
and everyone

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,430
is watching us closely.

137
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,310
In this big mansion,

138
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,600
there are schemes everywhere.

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,040
Though you're clever,

140
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,430
when facing truly wicked people,

141
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,480
you won't be able to deal with them.

142
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

143
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,000
It's better

144
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,120
if we leave for now.

145
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,070
When things calm down,

146
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,950
we can return, alright?

147
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,510
Mother, I know you're worried about me.

148
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,440
But don't worry.

149
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,720
I have a plan.

150
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,190
We'll both be fine.

151
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,070
I've examined it.

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,440
The ingredients in the tea bag

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,830
match the recipe exactly.

154
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,720
Taking it long-term

155
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,159
is very good for health.

156
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,510
Most importantly,

157
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,390
there's no trace of poison at all.

158
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,260
Madam Feng and her daughter

159
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,490
must be innocent.

160
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,310
Huo Dairong is too smart

161
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,920
to give us

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,650
poisoned tea for examination.

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
Then wasn't having me test it

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
a waste of time?

165
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,800
No.

166
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,159
I had you examine the tea

167
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,420
so you'd have something to compare with.

168
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,860
Compare with what?

169
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,950
Beiming.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,190
I found what you asked me

171
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,920
to look for.

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,510
What's this?

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,820
When I was inspecting

174
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,870
General Huo's study,

175
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,360
I noticed this flower was positioned

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,000
differently from the other plants.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
More importantly,

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,950
all other flowers
have withered this season,

179
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,680
yet this one is still blooming.

180
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,920
So I asked Tong Shuang

181
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,780
to do me a favor.

182
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,160
So the medical consultation

183
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,340
was just to keep Huo Dairong occupied

184
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,360
and give Tong Shuang time?

185
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,909
Exactly.

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,929
Huo Dairong thought

187
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,240
that after Mrs. Huo
and Li Xiao were arrested,

188
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,360
the case was closed,

189
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
so she temporarily let her guard down.

190
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,630
So when I mentioned

191
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,000
the wellness tea to her,

192
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,150
she wasn't surprised at all.

193
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,610
She had clearly prepared.

194
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,789
Prepared?

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,790
Huo Dairong didn't just

196
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,080
swap out the tea bags in advance.

197
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
When she took me

198
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
to General Huo's study,

199
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
I noticed
that General Huo's tea set

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
had been replaced with a new one.

201
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,270
So regarding the wellness tea,

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,380
she didn't

203
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,140
slip up at all.

204
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,670
But no plan is ever perfect.

205
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,750
Look here.

206
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,910
There are leftover tea leaves here.

207
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,670
The tea dregs
are mixed with fallen leaves in the soil,

208
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,080
making them difficult to notice.

209
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
I guess General Huo had the habit

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,480
of pouring the last cup of tea

211
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,750
into the flowerpot.

212
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,600
Over time,

213
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,360
the poison in the tea

214
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,870
caused this flower to mutate.

215
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,960
So the issue was the water
used for watering.

216
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,910
I see.

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
Miss Huo didn't know

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
General Huo had this habit,

219
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,210
so she focused all her efforts

220
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,670
on changing the tea set

221
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,440
and overlooked

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,510
this flowerpot.

223
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,270
Smart.

224
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,870
Well?

225
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,450
Any way to prove it?

226
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,270
Let me think.

227
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,650
[Honored for Seniority and Virtue]

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,670
Beiming,

229
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,790
what is it?

230
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,040
I suddenly understand

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,790
why Huo Dairong was
still willing to help me

232
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,590
after discovering my identity.

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Is she planning to harm you?

234
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
After Feng Qingzhuo finishes testing,

235
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll confront her directly.

236
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,210
This flower itself isn't poisonous.

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,610
For now, I can't think of

238
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,480
a way to confirm it.

239
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,150
Aren't you always saying you're unbeatable

240
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,390
in medicine and poison?

241
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,970
What now?

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
Can't even deal with a flower?

243
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,970
Tong Shuang.

244
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,110
[Utter Devotion]

245
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Miss Huo,

246
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,110
are you looking for this?

247
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,200
Xiao Beiming,
your reputation is well-earned—

248
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
always one step ahead

249
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,910
and leaving no loose ends.

250
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,270
We found the same poison

251
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,290
in this flowerpot

252
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
as in General Huo's body.

253
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,630
Wait, I'm not done eating!

254
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,120
-What are you doing, Madman?
-I'm not mad.

255
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,640
Go buy me

256
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,390
a goat right now.

257
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,510
A goat? You want to eat goat?

258
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,750
I need it alive!

259
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,750
I've figured out
how to test for the poison.

260
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,470
Cut the crap.

261
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,730
Go buy it now.

262
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,750
Red crystal has a foul smell,

263
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,550
but if the dosage is controlled,

264
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,810
its smell can be completely masked

265
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,830
by the wellness tea's herbal scent.

266
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,010
Impressive, Coroner Feng.

267
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,150
So it was you who killed General Huo?

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
That's right.

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,720
It was me.

270
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,100
But he was your father!

271
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,670
My father?

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,130
What kind of father would treat

273
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,460
his daughter like that?

274
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,740
Ever since I was young,

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,720
he had treated me

276
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,150
like an annoying object,

277
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,960
always ignoring me.

278
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
Then he married that woman

279
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,320
and let her bully us

280
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,600
and target us.

281
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,630
And what did he do?

282
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,320
He turned a blind eye and did nothing.

283
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,160
Shouldn't I hate him?

284
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,670
Shouldn't I kill him?

285
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,230
Just because of resentment,

286
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
you poisoned

287
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
General Huo's tea?

288
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
That's right.

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,030
I knew the poison was a hallucinogen.

290
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,790
So I secretly

291
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,390
added it to his wellness tea.

292
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,630
I thought

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,860
he'd just get sick and die slowly.

294
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,360
But I never imagined

295
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,000
he'd strangle himself

296
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,670
under the effects of the hallucinations.

297
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,960
That was karma.

298
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,750
Just to poison him,

299
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,410
you even

300
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,750
used your own mother?

301
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
After killing him

302
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
and pinning it on that woman,

303
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,670
I'd be the only mistress

304
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,960
of the Huo household.

305
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
By that time,

306
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,970
my mother could

307
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,390
live her best life.

308
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
It was worth it.

309
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,440
I had no other choice.

310
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,600
Miss Huo,

311
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,960
at this point,

312
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,200
telling the truth

313
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,630
is your only way out.

314
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,150
I did kill him.

315
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,870
Everything I just said is true.

316
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,000
She's lying.

317
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,080
Mother,

318
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,030
you're not well.

319
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,320
You shouldn't be out of bed.

320
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
Qing Ying, help my mother
back to her room.

321
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Kneel.

322
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,600
I...

323
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,200
Kneel!

324
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,790
Mother,

325
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,150
I was wrong.

326
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,550
I killed Father.

327
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
They've already found me out.

328
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,550
The evidence is solid.

329
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,950
There's no escape for me.

330
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,080
Mother,

331
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,000
I've failed you as your daughter.

332
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,510
I won't be able
to care for you in your old age.

333
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,600
Silly girl,

334
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,910
you think your little trick

335
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,750
can fool these officers?

336
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,840
You think you can take the fall for me?

337
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
Mother,

338
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,870
what are you talking about?

339
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,960
I killed Father.

340
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
It had nothing to do with you.

341
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,510
Qing Ying, take my mother back.

342
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,840
Fine, then tell me—

343
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,040
hallucinogenic herbs are all banned.

344
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,360
What kind of pharmacy
would sell them to you?

345
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,250
Where did you

346
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,360
get these herbs?

347
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Get up.

348
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,210
What's meant to happen
will happen eventually.

349
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,150
Help me sit down.

350
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,790
My Lords,

351
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
I came here

352
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,360
to clarify things.

353
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,240
I killed General.

354
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,360
What exactly happened?

355
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,790
It started

356
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,390
as an accident.

357
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,270
Six months ago,

358
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,200
General was troubled by something

359
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,750
and often had me accompany him
in the study.

360
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,150
Later, by chance,

361
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,480
I met

362
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
a limping physician.

363
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,320
He gave me a bottle of pills.

364
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,670
He said if I ground them into powder

365
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,910
and added it to tea,

366
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,960
General would forget his worries

367
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,150
and treat me with affection.

368
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,750
I didn't really believe it,

369
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,360
but I wanted to try.

370
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,440
Surprisingly, after General took the tea,

371
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,000
he became energetic.

372
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,320
After that, he had me

373
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,510
brew tea for him every day.

374
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,320
And he treated me

375
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,790
with growing affection.

376
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,790
But later,

377
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,240
I started to notice

378
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,750
something was wrong.

379
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
Addiction.

380
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,200
That's right.

381
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,360
General became more energetic

382
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,390
but also

383
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,790
more irritable.

384
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
I tried to stop giving him the tea.

385
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,000
General,

386
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,750
that's all the tea for today.

387
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
But at that time,

388
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,440
he was like a wild beast

389
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,440
and even beat me badly.

390
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,950
I had no choice

391
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,320
but to keep brewing the tea for him.

392
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,000
I thought

393
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,000
I could just endure it.

394
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
But then one day,

395
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,750
after he drank the tea…

396
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,240
General,

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,030
you're still up so late?

398
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,270
General,

399
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,200
let me help you to bed.

400
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,500

401
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,940
The ghost of Haiya!

402
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,069
I'm going to kill her.

403
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,180
-I'm going to kill her!
-General.

404
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,680
General!

405
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,349
I'm going to kill her!

406
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,480
-General! General!
-Don't stop me!

407
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
Don't let her get away!

408
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,109
Don't let her get away!

409
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,960
She's here to take revenge on me!

[Honored for Seniority and Virtue]

411
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
General!

412
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,650
The way General looked at Dairong…

413
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,590
I'll never forget it.

414
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,400
I'd never allow him

415
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,750
to hurt my Dairong.

416
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,200
So I decided

417
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,720
to kill him.

418
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,480
By then,
he couldn't notice anything unusual,

419
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,270
so I increased the dosage.

420
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,310
I watched him spiral into madness.

421
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,550
I watched him

422
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,310
strangle himself to death.

423
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,480
Mother.

424
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,310
That's how it happened.

425
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,790
I'm the real murderer.

426
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,960
I'm the one who killed General.

427
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,480
Mother,

428
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,590
even if it was you,

429
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
I can find a way to save you.

430
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,880
Don't bother, Dairong.

431
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,680
Constable Xiao,

432
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,750

433
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,290
It's fair, isn't it?

434
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,030
That day, you saw through my identity

435
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,560
and chose to keep my secret.

436
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,030
You were planning

437
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,030
to threaten me

438
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,440
with my life

439
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,080
into sparing Madam Feng

440
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,830
when I cracked the case, weren't you?

441
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,640
That's right.

442
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,960
You're a wanted criminal
in the Qi Kingdom.

to the Secret Investigation Unit,

444
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,470
even if you're not Yesha,

445
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,820
your life won't be yours

446
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,880

to the Huo Mansion.

455
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,460
Before I came here,

456
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,680
I had already figured out

457
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,610
your intention.

458
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,720
To be honest,

459
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,070
I was torn.

460
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,210
And I'm sure they're even more so.

461
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,960
My life matters,

462
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,590
but some things

463
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,640
matter more than that.

464
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,240
If I made this deal

465
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,480
with you today,

466

going until now

468
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,860
would completely fall apart.

469
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,640
Miss Huo, you once said

470
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,960
that you know well about

471
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,800
everything I did

472
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,110
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

473
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,510
Then you should know

474
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,160
that I don't respond well to threats.

475
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,270
I didn't before,

476
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,030
and I won't now.

477
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,250
Whatever you want to do,

478
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,960
I'll face it head-on.

479

-Mother.
-Madam.

480
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,830
Please, don't make this harder.

482
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,480
Mother, what's wrong with you?

483
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,790
I wanted

484
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,960
to find you a good man

485
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,000

486

But now,

487
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,350

488
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

502
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I know

503
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,720
you all have doubts

504
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,460
about Dairong's origins.

505
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,000
Now,

506
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,030
I can tell you the truth.

Actually, she…

508

a baby from the border.

513
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,070
That baby was Dairong.

514
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,200
I've never

515
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,920
told anyone about this.

516
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,310
Not even Dairong herself knew.

517
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,640
So,

518
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,790

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,310

always hard on you—

524
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,680

your origins.

526
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,350
Don't blame him.

in Haiya back then?

576
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,750
Something about this case

577
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,790
feels off.

578
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,550
Off?

579
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,720
You mean Madam Feng?

580
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,720
That limping physician

581
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,680
she mentioned—

582
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,390
the timing of his appearance

583
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,440
and his motive for giving her

584
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,510
the red crystal—

585
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,010
neither of them adds up.

586
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,880
But Madam Feng confessed and took poison.

587
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,010
She was so resolute.

588
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,550
It's exactly because she was so resolute

589
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,010
that it feels suspicious.

590
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,640
It's like she took her own life

591
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,900
to cover something up.

592
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,750
You mean

593
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
this case isn't over yet?

594
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,480
But what…

595
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,960
what kind of person

596
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
or secret is worth dying to protect?

597
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,640
Huo Dairong.

598
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,310
Not everyone

599
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,110
from Haiya is necessarily evil,

600
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,270
right?

601
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,790
Huo Dairong didn't even know

602
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,110
about her own background.

603
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,030
She only learned it from Madam Feng

604
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,290
right before she died.

605
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,110
If Zhu Yitie hadn't confessed himself,

606
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,750
we wouldn't have known

607
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,280
he was an orphan from Haiya.

608
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,030
Anyway, I don't think

609
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,750
she's a bad person.

610
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,960
Master,

611
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,830
if we let them keep digging like this,

612
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,160
it'll lead to disaster.

613
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,550
Everything is going as I planned.

614
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,000
But...

615
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,920
Go do what you need to do.

616
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,830
Yes.

617
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,080
She definitely isn't
the one behind all this.

618
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,730
My Lady,

619
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,230
Constable Zhong is here.

620
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,480
Miss Huo,

621
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,570
my condolences.

622
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,680
I know you're not here

623
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,790
to comfort me.

624
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,400
Today,

625
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,090
I just want to cry and mourn my mother.

626
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
But

627
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,880
the more I try to cry,

628
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,330
the harder it becomes.

629
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
No one can understand

630
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,680
the pain I'm feeling.

631
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,530
I understand how you feel.

632
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,510
Miss Huo,

633
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,970
so many people have died already.

634
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,350
Constable Xiao's secret

635
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,550
is safe with me.

636
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,690
Yes, many people have died.

637
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,880
I don't want

638
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,640
to hurt anyone else.

639
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,070
You have something to say.

640
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,750
Go ahead.

641
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,830
You can't keep things to yourself.

642
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,790
So just say it.

643
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,070
That limping physician...

644
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,920
I think I know who he is.

645
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,160
Who is he?

646
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,350
Beiming!

647
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,640
Beiming!

648
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,940
Beiming, wake up!

649
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,640
Beiming!

650
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,480
Beiming!

651
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,400
Beiming!

652
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,510
How is he?

653
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,640
The frost toxin has flared up again.

654
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,450
I didn't expect

655
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,510
the second attack to come so soon.

656
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,790
I've already performed acupuncture.

657
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,350
He should wake up soon.

658
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
But this time,

659
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,420
it's worse than last time.

660
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,480
I don't know

661
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,750
when the third attack happens…

662
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,480
Move!

663
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,270
Tong Shuang.

664
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,960
Even though the murderer
in the Huo Mansion case

665
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,350
has taken her own life,

666
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,750
I still don't think

667
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,110
it's that simple.

668
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
You're still trying to connect this case

669
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,790
to Xiao Beiming?

670
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,510
Even if there is a connection,

671
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,000
our only lead now

672
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,030
is that limping physician.

673
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,000
With just that one clue,

674
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,830
how are we supposed

675
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,240
to catch Xiao Beiming?

676
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,940
But I have a strong feeling

677
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,350
that Xiao Beiming is in the capital—

678
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,210
maybe even right under our noses.

679
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,030
Father,

680
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,420
give me a few more days.

681
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,400
I swear I'll catch him.

682
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,330
It's not that I won't give you time.

683
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,550
It's that we truly have no time left.

684
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,590
Do you think your instincts

685
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,720
can save both our lives

686
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
in these last few days?

687
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,790
Alright.

688
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll have Li Long investigate

689
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,330
the limping physician.

690
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,750
You focus on finding
another way out for us.

691
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,880
Even if we're doomed,

692
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,590
we can't

693
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,720
bet everything on one clue.

694
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,240
So you're saying

695
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,350
Madam Feng was

696
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,550
unknowingly

697
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,750
using forbidden medicine,

698
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,210
which led to this tragedy.

699
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,080
That physician is suspicious.

700
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,200
Besides the limp,

701
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,510
are there any other characteristics?

702
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,750
According to Madam Feng,

703
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,240
he seemed to be a wandering physician

704
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,830
who profited
from selling restricted drugs.

705
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,070
Apart from Madam Feng,

706
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,130
no one has seen him.

707
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,650
How's it going?

708
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,000
Have you found

709
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,200
a way to save Beiming?

710
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,960
I've gone through all the medical books

711
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,200
but found nothing.

712
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,710
However, I do have a new idea.

713
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,510
This is no time

714
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,160
for half-answers.

715
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,790
This method is extremely dangerous.

716
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,250
We should talk it through.

717
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,310
What are you saying?

718
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,960
Blood-freezing Frost is the deadliest

719
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,200
frost toxin I've ever seen.

720
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
It can't be neutralized

721
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,830
by common herbs

722
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,230
available in the market.

723
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,790
I want to fight poison with poison.

724
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,720
Fight poison with poison?

725
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,240
According to the principle
of yin and yang,

726
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,790
what can counteract Blood-freezing Frost

727
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,110
must be something extremely powerful

728
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,240
and fiery hot.

729
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,070
Only one thing

730
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,200
comes to mind.

731
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,440
[Fire Cicada,
a poison of extreme yang and heat]

732
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,830
What is a Fire Cicada?

733
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,360
Why have I never heard of it?

734
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,160
It's incredibly rare.

735
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,790
It's a herb that grows only

736
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,000
at volcanic craters.

737
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,330
It looks like a cicada,

738
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,640
hence the name.

739
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,510
With the Fire Cicada as a primer,

740
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,960
I might be able to

741
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,590
counteract the Blood-freezing Frost.

742
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,510
Then try it right away!

743
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,110
As I said,
the Fire Cicada is extremely rare.

744
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,030
It's not something you can just buy

745
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,920
at the market.

746
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Even if we do obtain it,

747
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,830
I can't guarantee

748
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,640
it'll work.

749
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,110
If it doesn't, I fear

750
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,770
Beiming may die because of it.

751
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,170
This method is too dangerous.

752
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
Regardless of the risk,

753
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,200
getting the Fire Cicada first

754
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,860
is better than doing nothing.

755
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,110
Where can I find it?

756
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,350
I'll go right away.

757
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,120
According to my master's medical book,

758
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,840
it can only be found
at the Ghost Market in the capital.

759
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,800
I've only read about this place
in medical books.

760
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,150
Why are all the things here

761
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,110
so strange and eerie?

762
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,880
Some are robbed,

763
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,630
some stolen,

764
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,150
some taken from murder victims,

765
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,280
and some even dug up

766
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,190
from ancestral graves.

767
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,590
Of course they're eerie.

768
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,960
No wonder it's called the Ghost Market.

769
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,800
Everything here

770
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,260
can't see the light of day.

771
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,280
Why are they

772
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,670
all staring at us?

773
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,510
Have we alerted them?

774
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,360
Maybe they smelled the scent of outsiders.

775
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,630
The rules of the Ghost Market:

776
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,000
no questions about who you are;

777
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
no questions
about where the goods came from.

778
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,710
We need to stay careful.

779
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,580
Don't get into trouble.

780
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,190
Got it.

781
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,410
Look, the Fire Cicada.

782
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,250
That's the Fire Cicada.

783
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,360
Don't move.

784
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,280
How much is this?

785
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,670
How much are you offering?

786
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,760
50 taels.

787
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,180
Is that enough?

788
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,410
100 taels then.

789
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Still not enough?

790
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,000
My rule for selling

791
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,320
is to trade one thing for another.

792
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,150
What do you think

793
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,280
you have on you that's valuable enough

794
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
to exchange for that thing?

795
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,820
This thumb ring is a token from a bank.

796
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,190
It can be exchanged
for money or land deeds.

797
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,920
This is

798
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,550
the most valuable thing on me.

799
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,080
Can I trade it for your herb?

800
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,760
Of course not.

801
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,760
What exactly do you want?

802
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,550
Your eyes are beautiful, miss.

803
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,480
I wonder

804
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,670
if I could trade this

805
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,630
for one of your eyes.

806
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,280
The choice is yours.

807
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,400
What...

808
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,960
What's happening?

809
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,510
Hand it over!

810
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,400
Never!

811
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,920
You can't escape.

812
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,110
Girl, you're actually

813
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,070
a skilled fighter.

814
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,670
Constable Zhong,

815
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,400
watch out!

816
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,710
Who are you?

817
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,810
Are you alright?

818
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,290
Don't bother. You won't catch him.

819
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,720
What's wrong?

820
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,590
What happened to your eyes, Xueman?

821
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,630
I can't see.

822
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,710
You can't…
