[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,310
I assume

4
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,350
the autopsy is almost done by now.

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Constable Zhong.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,300
Please have the people inside
open the door.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
What should we do?

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,760
Constable Zhong, please.

9
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,430
He's the one who stole Master's body!

10
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,220
Did the autopsy reveal anything?

11
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,470
Chief Fang.

12
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,560
The victim did not die of illness.

13
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,240
There are some doubts about the cause.

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,870
Nonsense!

15
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,710
Master clearly died of illness.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,030
Since there are doubts,

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
let's hear

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,030
what Coroner Feng has to say.

19
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,240
What do you all think?

20
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,730
I am Huo Dairong, Huo Zongyao's daughter.

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,470
I agree with Chief Fang's suggestion.

22
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,520
Let's first hear the autopsy results.

23
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
If my father was truly murdered,

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,130
I request the Elite Constabulary Unit

25
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,590
and the Secret Investigation Unit
to take charge

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,850
and uncover the truth.

27
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,840
Alright.

28
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,280
Please come in, everyone,

29
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,810
and allow me to explain everything
in detail.

30
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,190
You just said

31
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,840
there were two people involved in
stealing the body, right?

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
That's right.

33
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,030
These are the two.

34
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,040
Chief.

35
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,950
Mo Chong.

36
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,790
Are you going along with Zhong Xueman

37
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,720
in her nonsense?

38
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,070
It's just that I... I heard that Xueman...

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,490
I'm just glad you're alright, Xueman.

40
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,450
Coroner Feng,

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,630
please share with everyone

42
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,190
the results of your autopsy.

43
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,240
Yes, Chief.

44
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
There are strangulation marks
on General Huo's neck.

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
These weren't there before.

46
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,540
What did you do to my husband?

47
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,560
What I used just now is

48
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,360
the most common kind of badger oil.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Badger oil can remove cosmetic powder.

50
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,830
The reason we didn't

51
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,510
notice

52
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,390
the wounds on General Huo's body before

53
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,290
was because someone

54
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,480
used a specific type of cosmetic powder

55
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
to cover them up.

56
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
Someone wanted to disguise

57
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,360
the true cause of General Huo's death.

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
But such amateur tricks

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,390
can't fool us coroners.

60
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,159
The underside of General Huo's tongue

61
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,360
is swollen and dark purple,

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
and there's hemorrhaging in his eyes.

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,830
All these symptoms indicate

64
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,360
he died from asphyxiation.

65
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,360
Combined with

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,020
the strangulation marks
on General Huo's neck,

67
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,950
he was strangled to death.

68
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,600
Darling...

69
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,190
Darling!

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,390
Darling!

71
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,750
Who would want to harm him?

72
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,390
There's already evidence proving

73
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,800
General Huo was murdered.

74
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,390
Does anyone have any further comments?

75
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Who could have done this to him?

76
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
Who would go so far as to harm him?

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,430
Mrs. Huo, please accept my condolences.

78
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,070
Since this is confirmed as a murder case,

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,120
our Secret Investigation Unit

80
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,870
will surely see this case to the end

81
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
and bring justice to the Huo family.

82
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,600
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

83
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,360
Hold on.

84
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Don't think you can fool us so easily.

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Case investigation

86
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,630
is your duty,

87
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,240
but Zhong Xueman's crime

88
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
cannot be let off so easily.

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
What do you mean?

90
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,720
Are you going back on your word?

91
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
These are two separate matters.

92
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,950
What,

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,750
is the Second Division of
the Ministry of Justice

94
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,950
planning to show favoritism in public?

95
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,190
Since this matter started because of me,

96
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,830
please leave the investigation

97
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,630
to Constable Zhong and me.

98
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,430
We'll uncover the truth

99
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,830
and make amends for our mistakes.

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,950
What if the investigation

101
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,070
goes on for three to five years

102
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,270
without any results?

103
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,390
What then?

104
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,860
Well, let's set

105
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,390
General Huo's seventh-day memorial
as the deadline.

106
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,070
If the case remains unsolved by then,

107
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,310
we shall accept punishment ourselves.

108
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,190
Or tomorrow,

109
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,920
you can go to the Ministry of Justice

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,510
to file a report
and convict Constable Zhong and me.

111
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,070
No need to wait until tomorrow.

112
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,530
We'll file the case today.

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,360
Since this involves the daughter of
King Zhong of Constables

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,480
and the son of Chief Zhuge,

115
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,510
the Ministry of Justice
will surely take this seriously.

116
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,310
File the case!

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,070
Since things have come to this point,

118
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,270
let's proceed as Mr. Zhuge suggested.

119
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,950
Thank you in advance, Coroner Feng.

120
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,840
Once my father's case is solved,

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,290
I will properly express my gratitude.

122
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,950
No need for formalities.

123
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,830
This is my duty,

124
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,470
a small effort on my part.

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,669
Zhong Xueman.

126
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,929
Why does trouble follow you everywhere?

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
Are you some kind of jinx?

128
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,240
And how did you end up

129
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,530
getting involved up with Zhuge Kongyun?

130
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,870
It's because
I agreed to cooperate with them.

131
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,870
What do the members of
the Elite Constabulary Unit

132
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,870
think about this?

133
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,480
This is my personal decision.

134
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,320
It has nothing to do with
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,980
I just want to capture Yesha
as soon as possible.

136
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,200
Look at you, so stubborn and unyielding.

137
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,390
If I hadn't come today,

138
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
how would you have handled this situation?

139
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,200
I was reckless, Sir.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I owe it to you this time, Chief Fang.

141
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,550
Alright then.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
Cooperation it is.

143
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
But one thing.

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
Any lead you discover

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,670
while working with
the Secret Investigation Unit

146
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,670
must be reported to me immediately.

147
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,270
I hope

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,950
you'll capture Xiao Beiming yourself.

149
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,360
Understood.

151
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes, Chief.

152
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,040
Miss Huo has really been through a lot.

153
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,030
How tragic.

154
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,000
Where's Beiming?

155
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,750
He...

156
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,270
I think he should be

157

home by now.

158
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,370
Constable Zhong,
you don't play by the rules.

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,540
To help you,

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,610
I even got myself dragged into it.

161
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,550
Thanks a lot.

162
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Just this once. Don't expect it again.

If there's a next time,

164
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,050
not to mention I won't help you,

165
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,520
our partnership in case investigation

166
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,150
will also be over.

167
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,670
You're so petty.

168
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,550
It depends on who I'm dealing with.

169
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,360
With you,

170
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,480

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,080
Master was murdered?

How could this be?

175
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,000
The Elite Constabulary Unit's coroner
has performed an autopsy

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,120
and confirmed that he was indeed murdered.

177
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,600
Please don't be upset, Madam.

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,910
Your health is already poor.

179
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,240
He's not worth your distress.

00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
came from, Madam.

191
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's not talk about this anymore.

192
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,150
You're tired too.

193
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
Go back and rest.

194
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,480
I'll leave then.

195
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,320
Please have a good rest, Madam.

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,770
What's wrong, Dairong?

198
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,330
Now that he's gone,

199
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,910
Madam, you don't have to

200
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,840
stay up to make tea for him anymore.

201
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,770
This teabag is useless now.

202
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,900
I'll throw it away.

203
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,390
Alright.

204
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,480
Qing Ying.

205
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,080
My Lady.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,440
After Mother finishes her porridge,

207
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,790
make sure she rests early.

208
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,510
Yes.

209
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,250
Please have some porridge.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,030
Beiming.

211
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,870
That was really close.

212
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,380
I'm so glad you're back safely.

213
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,200
Fortunately, you were quick-witted,
Beiming,

214
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,910
otherwise the consequences

215
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,960
would have been unimaginable.

216
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
This is also thanks to you

217
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,880
and Mo Chong.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,660
Is there any way to wake him up?

219
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,700
Can you do that?

220
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,300
A few injections would do.

221
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,130
Are you alright?

222
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,200
Why did I fall asleep

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,390
as soon as I opened the door?

224
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,960
Come on, get up first.

225
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,790
You must have been too tired.

226
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,150
Why are you here?

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,270
That's not important.

228
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,370
Right now, your junior Xueman

229
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,630
is in danger out there,

230
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,210
and only you can help her.

231
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,630
Here,

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,600
put this on first.

233
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,360
Wait...

234
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,550
I have a plan.

235
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Trust me.

236
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,030
Please come in, everyone.

237
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll explain everything in detail.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,800
And that's how

239
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,750
I escaped through the back window
during the chaos.

240
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,270
It was really close this time.

241
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm not worried about anyone else.

242
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm just worried that
Zhuge Kongyun might discover something.

243
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,440
Besides,

244
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,060
as soon as he entered Room Tu,

245
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
he looked around everywhere

246
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,120
and even checked the corpse bed next door.

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,000
He's always

248
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,750
been suspicion of us.

249
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,120
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

250
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,150
There are many suspicious circumstances
surrounding General Huo's death.

251
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,350
The entire Huo family

252
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
is questionable.

253
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,550
That's right.

254
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,020
After seeing the autopsy results,

255
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,530
all the disciples of the Huo household

256
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,990
had strange expressions,

257
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,740
as if they were deliberately
hiding something.

258
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,550
If General Huo

259
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,910
was really strangled to death,

260
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,320
his family members and disciples

261
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,650
are highly suspicious.

262
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,270
Are you suggesting

263
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,510
that General Huo was very likely

264
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,840
killed by someone from his own household?

265
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,240
I can't say for certain,

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
but tonight, at the Huo Mansion,

267
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,380
I truly noticed a lot of strange details.

268
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
That night, I went to
the Huo's household's disciples' quarters,

269
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,080
where Huo Zongyao's disciples

270
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
reside.

271
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,120
The interior is modeled

272
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,650
after military standards,

273
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,070
and all items

274
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,360
are arranged according to

275
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,690
military regulations.

276
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,200
General Huo came from
a military background,

277
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,550
so he brought
the strict military discipline

278
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,550
back home.

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,390
Behind the sleeping quarters
is a training ground,

280
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,870
with a large fighting platform
in the center.

281
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,910
On that platform,

282
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,530
I found some bloodstains,

283
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,870
which had accumulated

284
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,560
[Be Strict with Oneself]

285
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,870
from blood dripping over the years.

286
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,270
It's obvious

287
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,440
that the sparring on that platform

288
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,300
was definitely not just for show.

289
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,720
This indicates that Huo Zongyao,

290
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,360
when training his disciples,

291
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,490
would make them fight for their lives.

292
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,770
Besides, I also found

293
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,170
torture devices on the training ground.

294
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,270
So these disciples

295
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,030
suffered inhuman treatment

296
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,320
year after year,

297
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
until they couldn't take it anymore

298
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,240
and developed murderous intentions.

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
Besides General Huo's disciples,

300
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Mrs. Huo

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,570
is also suspicious.

302
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,550
Mrs. Huo's back is covered with scars,

303
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,360
which clearly shows

304
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,750
she had been abused.

305
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,360
Also, someone whose husband just died

306
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
should be dressed more modestly, right?

307
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,510
But her undergarment

308
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,910
was particularly vibrant.

309
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,240
The way she was fixing her hair
in front of the mirror

310
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,510
seemed so relaxed and content,

311
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,360
as if her husband's death

312
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,630
was something to celebrate.

313
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,120
Something's clearly off about this.

314
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,810
If the abuse marks on Mrs. Huo's body

315
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,800
were all inflicted by Huo Zongyao,

316
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,750
then Mrs. Huo

317
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,350
also has a motive for murder.

318
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,480
Not just Mrs. Huo,

319
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,550
there was also

320
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,320
Xue Qianshan who wanted to set a fire.

321
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,180
Let's set a fire

322
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,550
and force them out!

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
Xue Qianshan clearly knew

324
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,080
General Huo's body was in the mortuary,

325
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,550
yet he still proposed to set a fire,

326
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,720
indicating he didn't care about the body

327
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,550
at all.

328
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,840
More like he wanted
to destroy the evidence.

329
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,170
There's one more person

330
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,010
I can't quite see through.

331
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,340
You mean General Huo's daughter,

332
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,360
Huo Dairong?

333
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,270
That young lady looked

334
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,390
gentle and fragile.

335
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,840
She didn't seem like a bad person.

336
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,240
She saw through

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,750
my identity at a glance.

338
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,870
She's definitely no ordinary woman.

339
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,910
Although you're in a Prosperity Robe,

340
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,000
the boots you're wearing

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,130
are official boots.

342
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,030
You are Zhong Xueman, right?

343
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,360
She's that good?

344
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,840
Also, that day, she tricked me

345
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,290
into going to the Huo Mansion's bedroom,

346
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,870
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

347
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,790
making me run into Mrs. Huo

348
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,120
and expose my identity.

349
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,240
After that, she deliberately
tried to curry favor with me.

350
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,300
I can't tell what she's really after.

351
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,030
This Miss Huo's clearly more complicated
than she looks.

352
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,360
We don't have enough clues for now,

353
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,620
so we need to visit the Huo Mansion again.

354
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,720
Yeah, we should.

355
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,750
Xueman.

356
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,200
Beiming.

357
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,850
Something troubling you?

358
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,280
It seems that Huo Zongyao's case

359
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,270
truly has nothing to do with Yesha.

360
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,440
It does appear that way for now.

361
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,270
Even if General Huo was murdered,

362
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,630
among our current suspects,

363
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,840
whether it's Mrs. Huo,

364
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,790
the disciples,

365
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,320
or even Huo Dairong,

366
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,980
their motives for murder

367
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,030
are all confined within the Huo household.

368
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,510
There's no connection to Haiya,

369
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,349
nor any link to Yesha.

370
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,920
That's why I'm worried.

371
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,069
You're worried we're wasting our efforts,

372
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,589
that even if we solve this case,

373
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,520
it won't help clear my name, right?

374
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,150

563
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,440
Come on, take your revenge!

564
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,110
Master!

565
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,230
Take your revenge!

566
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Master!

567
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on!

568
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,110

Come on!

571
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,350
I'll give it back to you!

572
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,750
That scene

573
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,860
happened right before our eyes.

574
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,400
He strangled himself to death?

575
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,790
I'm telling the truth.

576
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,450
That night,

577
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,720
I wasn't the only one there.

578
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Besides me, Senior Xue,

579
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,650
Mrs. Huo, Miss Huo,

580
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,590
and two maids,

581
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,750
they all saw it.

582
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,170
We'll know as soon as

583
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,390
we examine the body in the morgue.

584
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,680
[Morgue]

585
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,010
But I don't understand

586
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
how he could strangle himself to death.

587
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,400
When a person is conscious,

588
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,800
it's nearly impossible to

589
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,590
strangle oneself.

590
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,450
It's impossible when conscious,

591
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,310
but what if he wasn't conscious?

592
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,890
What do you mean?

593
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
Do you know about the Five-Mineral Powder?

594
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,810
Yes, I do.

595
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,510
It's a banned drug in the Qi Kingdom.

596
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,380
The Five-Mineral Powder was originally

597
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,750
used to treat cold symptoms.

598
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,400
But an official from the previous dynasty
discovered that

599
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,440
taking it could cause the body
to feel overheated

600
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,790
and the mind to become unusually clear,
causing hallucinations

601
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,250
and a feeling of euphoria.

602
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
Under his influence,

603
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,550
it became widely used.

604
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,000
But later, it was discovered

605
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,750
that this drug causes chronic poisoning,

606
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,960
and many long-term users

607
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
lost their lives.

608
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,960
So in our dynasty,

609
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,550
it's classified as a banned drug.

610
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,810
It's hallucinogenic?

611
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,270
Are you suggesting

612
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,470
General Huo died while hallucinating?

613
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,510
Very likely.

614
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,550
General Huo was highly skilled
in martial arts.

615
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,720
If he suddenly unleashed
his internal energy on himself,

616
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
even his survival instinct

617
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,620
couldn't reverse the damage.

618
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,510
Just by looking at the surface,

619
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,110
I have no way

620
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,370
to verify your theory.

621
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,240
I need to perform an autopsy.

622
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,030
That's okay.

623
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,750
Zhuge Kongyun

624
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,160
should be questioning people
at the Huo Mansion.

625
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,220
We still have time.

626
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,590

627
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,830
The Secret Investigation Unit is here
to investigate on imperial orders.

628
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,960
Who do you want to investigate?

629
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,690
Huo Zongyao.

630
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,500
Huo Zongyao again?

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,720
Xueman.

632
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,750
Coroner Feng just arrived earlier,

633
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,680
and he's still here.

634
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,750
Why is he here again?

635
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,550
I have no idea.

[Secret Investigation Unit]

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,490
What are you doing here?

639
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,930
What do you mean?

640
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,990
I should be the one asking that.

641
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,960
Why are you here?

642
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,680
I...

643
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,270
Last night,

644
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
I realized that

645
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,310
there might be something strange
about the body,

646
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,450
so I came back

647
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
to re-examine it.

648
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,720
What's strange?

649
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,640
General Huo

650
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,120
might have actually

651
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,740
strangled himself to death.

652
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,440
Wait.

653
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,510
What are you doing?

654
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,070
We can't perform the autopsy yet.

655
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,810
You startled me. What's wrong?

656
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
If General Huo really

657
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
strangled himself to death,

658
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
those in the Huo household
must know about it.

659
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,300
Otherwise,
they wouldn't have tried to hide

660
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,360
the strangulation marks on his neck.

661
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,960
Zhuge Kongyun is too clever.

662
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,270
They won't be able to hide it from him,

663
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,550
and he'll definitely come here

664
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,000
to verify with an autopsy.

665
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,270
Zhuge Kongyun?

666
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,900
Is he really that good?

667
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,880
He should already be

668
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,940
on his way here now.

669
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,680
W-What should we do then?

670
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,640

Yes,

673
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,480
but I need to perform an autopsy

674
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,920
to verify this theory.

675
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,370
Then go ahead and do it.

676
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,830
What's that supposed to mean?

677
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,160
The autopsy process

678
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
might be unpleasant to watch.

679
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,750
You two might want to look away.

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
We're all constables here.

681
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,440
What's the big deal about an autopsy?

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,920
Why would we not be able to handle it?

683
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,510
Well,

684
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,640
Mr. Zhuge,

685
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,160
you surely have exceptional courage.

686
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,960
But the last time we performed an autopsy,

687
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,270
Constable Zhong felt sick

688
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,270
for several days.

689
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,110
So the great Constable Zhong

690
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,350
is scared of this?

691
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm a woman after all.

692
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,000
I can't stand watching autopsies.

693
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,660
What's so strange about that?

694
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,590
If you hadn't mentioned you're a woman,

695
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,750
I would have almost forgotten about it.

696
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,750
Since you can't stand watching it,

697
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,510
then don't.

698
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,400
Cut the crap.

699
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,480
Since Li Xiao wasn't lying,

700
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,590
I'll return to the Huo Mansion
to continue the interrogation.

701
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,450
Let me know when you have results.

702
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,130

How about

710
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,240
I go with you?

That way, if something goes wrong,

712

haven't you?

00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,440
Of course.

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,110
I'm now

I can take you,

but let me ask you.

719
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,590

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,020
whose will you use?

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,000
Jiang Yi's?

723
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,160
No, Jiang Yi is a bit too old,

724
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,880
and Fang Yin is a bit too ugly.

Mr. Zhuge,

729
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,400
maybe you should go outside
for some fresh air.

751
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,160
I developed myself.

752
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,770
I wouldn't be willing to

753
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,230
share it with just anyone.

754
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,200
Recently,

755
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,160
I've developed

756
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,070
a new type of pill that can

757
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,330
nourish yin and strengthen the kidneys.

758
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,000
Young Master.

759
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,310
This won't be

760
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,000
like the Five-Blood Pill from last time,
will it?

761
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,480
That was an accident last time,

762
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,680
a misunderstanding.

763
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Now that we're in the same boat,

764
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,110
I wouldn't lie to you even a bit.

765
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,920
How is it?

766
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,670
I didn't lie to you, did I?

767
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,410
Please wait a moment, you two.

768
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,980
Li Xiao said General Huo lived
a glorious life,

769
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,580
yet his death was so strange.

770
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,440
Those in the Huo household

771
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,400
didn't want him to be gossiped about

772
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,070
and lose his dignity after death,

773
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,830
so they covered up the marks
with cosmetic powder

774
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,560
and claimed he died of illness.

775
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,640
If Feng Qingzhuo can verify

776
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
that there were hallucinogens
in General Huo's body,

777
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,260
the Huo household
will surely be held accountable.

778
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,200
Who could it be?

779
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,550
Let's meet them one by one

780
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,150
and see what they're hiding.

781
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,440
What should we do

782
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
if Zhuge Kongyun comes back?

783
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,570
With Feng Qingzhuo there,

784
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,900
he can buy us some time.

785
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,880
Constable Zhong,

786
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
who is this?

787
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,920
This is Constable Tong Shuang
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

788
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,030
Since time is of the essence,

789
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,200
Mr. Zhuge and I

790
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,790
are investigating separately.

791
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,390
Greetings, Constable Tong.

792
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Constable Zhong.

793
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,270
Does the autopsy confirm my statement

794
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,750
that Master died by suicide?

795
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,270
Mr. Zhuge is still examining.

796
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,500
There are still many suspicious points
about the body

797
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,350
that haven't been clarified.

798
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,510
However, before that,

799
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,230
I'd like to meet

800
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,270
those who were present

801
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,270
on the night of General Huo's death.

802
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,200
What's wrong?

803
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,660
Is that inconvenient?

804
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,790
No.

805
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,050
Please come with me.

806
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,960
Senior Xue is not in the mansion today.

807
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,030
He left early this morning.

808
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,640
Junior, please inform Senior Xue that

809
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,840
people from the Elite Constabulary Unit
came for a visit.

810
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,550
Please.

811
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,150
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

812
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,290
Madam, Constable Zhong

813
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,310
from the Elite Constabulary Unit
requests to see you.

814
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,400
Madam?

815
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,720
Master passed away suddenly,

816
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,400
and Madam is overwhelmed with grief.

817
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,510
She's feeling unwell today

818
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,680
and cannot receive visitors.

819
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,350
Everyone,

820
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,120
please see yourselves out.

821
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,510
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

822
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,880
How about you two

823
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,260
come back another day?

824
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,090
Young Master Li.

825
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,920
Would it be possible for you

826
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,320
to show us your quarters?

827
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,960
Please.

828
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,510
This is my residence.

829
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,080
Feel free to look around.

830
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,110
Young Master Li, when did you

831
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,830
become General Huo's disciple?

832
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,030
Have you ever gone to battle
with General Huo?

833
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,400
I feel ashamed to say this,

834
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,160
but I only became his disciple
three years ago.

835
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,030
Since I became his disciple late,

836
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,550
I never went to the battlefield.

837
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,590
Unlike Senior Xue,
who comes from a military background

838
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,270
and has been to battle with Master.

839
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,000
Fortunately, Master favored me,

840
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,720
so I could use my mediocre knowledge

841
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,190
to help manage his household affairs.

842
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,760
Manage his household affairs?

843
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,280
Don't you practice martial arts,
Young Master Li?

844
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
I know some martial arts,

845
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
but I'm not as skilled as
my fellow disciples.

846
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,110
I heard that
General Huo valued martial skills greatly

847
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,550
when taking disciples.

848
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,550
Guess he saw you

849
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,510
in a different light, Young Master Li.

850
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,230
You must be exceptionally talented.

851
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,780
Constable Zhong, you flatter me.

852
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,440
No, don't!

853
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,400
What's wrong, Young Master Li?

854
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,670
This blade is sharp.

855
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,870
Please be careful not to hurt yourself.

856
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,830
It's alright.

857
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,510
This blade is exquisitely crafted,

858
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,110
truly hard to put down.

859
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,900
However, Young Master Li,

860
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,560
why do you hang this blade
at your bedside?

861
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
A blade hanging over your head

862
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,540
seems rather unlucky.

863
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,230
This blade

864
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,280
was a gift from my family.

865
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,320
I hang it by my bed

866
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,510
as a constant reminder of my family.

867
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,550
I see.

868
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,910
I apologize for my presumption.

869
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,670
My residence is in disarray.

870
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,630
Please forgive the mess.

871
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,110
I've heard that General Huo

872
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,480
was usually extremely strict
with his subordinates

873
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,920
and even went so far
as to physically abuse them.

874
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,840
Is that true?

875
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,440
My late master

876
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,400
came from a military background.

877
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,630
People trained in martial arts
tend to be stern,

878
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,710
which is quite normal.

879
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,880
Besides, a general

880
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,760
can't be too soft with soldiers.

881
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,400
But calling it abuse

882
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,660
is definitely an overstatement.

883
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
And was there anything unusual about

884
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,940
General Huo's daily routine?

885
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
The General had been retired
for quite some time,

886
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,510
and he kept a very regular schedule.

887
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,440
He even ate his meals with us disciples,

888
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
nothing out of the ordinary.

889
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,190
Is Miss Huo at home?

890
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,890
Could you take us to see her?

891
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,230
Okay, I'll take you.

892
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,110
Thank you.

893
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,960
What did you find?

894
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,630
General Huo's brain tissue

895
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,760
is riddled with holes like an ant colony.

896
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,960
This is the result of long-term use

897
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,590
of some kind of hallucinogenic drug

898
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,960
that causes this characteristic damage.

899
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,440
Long-term use?

900
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,320
Cover it up!

901
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,030
Although I can't identify

902
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,150
the exact drug,

903
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,440
it's clear that he had been taking it
for several months,

904
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
possibly even half a year.

905
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,030
Only then would the brain tissue

906
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,830
develop this kind of condition.

907
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,920
But after taking it for so long,

908
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,880
how could General Huo not have noticed

909
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,140
he was being poisoned?

910
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,190
Either he was murdered—

911
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,920
the killer administered

912
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,030
small doses of poison daily,

913
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,690
so General Huo didn't notice,

914
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,150
and in the end, the accumulated dose

915
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,150
drove General Huo

916
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,590
to take his own life
in a hallucinated state;

917
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:51,960
or it was like the situation

918
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,840
with the Five-Mineral Powder
from the previous dynasty,

919
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,440
that General Huo became addicted

920
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
and couldn't control
his daily consumption,

921
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,190
and it eventually killed him.

922
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,230
Regardless of which theory is correct,

923
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,800
we need to go to
the Huo Mansion to investigate.

924
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,550
Come with me.

925
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,400
Me?

926
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,450
I don't know anything about
hallucinogenic drugs.

927
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,320
Up ahead

928
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,170
is Madam Feng's residence
in the East Courtyard.

929
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,510
Steward Li.

930
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,500
Lord Zhuge is here?

931
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,150
Mr. Zhuge has brought someone here,

932
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,630
requesting to inspect Master's pharmacy.

933
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,680
Would you two prefer to

934
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,920
go meet with Mr. Zhuge with me,

935
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,320
or continue investigating
the East Courtyard?

936
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,070
Young Master Li,

937
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,550
please go attend to Mr. Zhuge first.

938
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,960
We'll look around a bit more.

939
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,220
Then I'll take my leave

940
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,140
and won't accompany you further.

941
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,440
They're going to check the pharmacy.

942
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,150
It seems the body

943
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,840
truly contained hallucinogens.

944
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,370
Zhuge Kongyun has arrived.

945
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,030
If we continue our investigation,

946
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,690
how should you get away later?

947
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,030
He must have brought Feng Qingzhuo
with him,

948
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,510
who can buy us some time.

949
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,250
The East Courtyard is where Miss Huo

950
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,510
and Madam Feng reside.

951
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,150
Miss Huo's behavior

952
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,880
is puzzling even to me.

953
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,840
Since we're already here,

954
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,170
we must go investigate.

955
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,800
But...

956
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,590
Don't worry.

957
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,250
It won't take long.

958
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Li already sent someone to inform us

959
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,920
that Constable Zhong would be coming.

960
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,070
Madam is unwell

961
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,360
and resting inside,

962
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,550
and she asked me to wait for you here.

963
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,590
Qing Ying, you may leave now.

964
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,360
I'll handle this.

965
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,960
Yes.

966
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Constable Zhong,
if you have any questions,

967
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,550
please feel free to ask.

968
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,920
I will certainly tell you
everything I know

969
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,150
and hold nothing back.

970
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,280
Thank you, Miss Huo.

971
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,200
And who is this?

972
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm Tong Shuang, a constable from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

973
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,010
Constable Tong, please have some tea.

974
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,690
Why do you keep staring at him?

975
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,860
It's quite the coincidence.

976
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,590
Constable Tong's appearance

977
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,360
closely resembles

978
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,020
an old friend I once held dear.

979
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,330
That's indeed a coincidence.

980
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,320
May I ask where

981
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,670
this old friend of yours

982
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,800
is now, Miss Huo?

983
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,190
He left on a long journey

984
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,590
and hasn't returned yet.

985
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,400
We haven't seen each other
for quite some time.

986
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,510
I heard from Young Master Li that

987
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,880
on the night of General Huo's death,

988
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
you were also present, Miss Huo,

989
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,360
and that the wounds on General Huo's body

990
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
were also covered up by you,

991
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,760
Miss Huo, with cosmetic powder.

992
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,590
Is that true?

993
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,520
Yes, that's correct.

994
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,590
Since you knew
the cause of the General's death,

995
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,320
why did you lie to me that night?

996
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,730
Since you've already concluded

997
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,440
that my father strangled himself,

998
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,300
why bother questioning me again?

999
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,590
Because there are still doubts
surrounding the case.

1000
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,720
Of course there are.

1001
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,920
My father was always calm and composed,

1002
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,580
with no troubles whatsoever.

1003
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Why would he suddenly take his own life?

1004
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,590
Although I witnessed it with my own eyes,

1005
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,650
what one sees isn't always the truth.

1006
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,760
So regarding my father's death,

1007
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,230
I also have my doubts.

1008
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,630
Everything I told you that day,
Constable Zhong,

1009
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,110
was completely true,
without a single false word.

1010
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,510
So why didn't you speak up

1011
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,670
during the autopsy?

1012
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,290
My Lords, please understand.

1013
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,760
Although I'm the heiress
of the Huo family,

1014
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,230
I have very little influence

1015
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,800
within this household.

1016
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,840
What I did that day

1017
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,190
was purely for self-preservation.

1018
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,710
Thankfully, you officers
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

1019
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,510
are brave and fearless

1020
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,910
in uncovering the truth,

1021
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,710
giving hope that my father's death cause
may be brought to light.

1022
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,360
I am deeply grateful to both of you.
