[Episode 22]

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,870
Beiming,

4
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,229
the case hasn't been concluded yet.

5
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,830
They won't

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,229
convict Xueman so quickly.

7
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,840
Besides, she's the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
and a member
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,590
They wouldn't go so far as to torture her.

10
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,039
I need to go to the Yaksha Temple.

11
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,280
Beiming, your health now...

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
The top priority now

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
is for you to rest and recover.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Leave the rest

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
to us.

16
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,289
Don't worry about anything else.

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,040
If Xueman didn't kill him,

18
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
there must be evidence at the scene.

19
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,080
When we came in last night,

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,960
only Constable Zhong

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
and Old Bug's body were here.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,150
Where was Xueman?

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,260
Constable Zhong was here.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Old Bug's body was here.

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,320
The two were more than eight feet apart.

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,360
You said Old Bug was burned?

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

28
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,960
When we arrived,

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
he was already beyond recognition.

30
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,000
Whether Xueman used fire

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,430
to directly burn Old Bug to death

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,030
or set the corpse on fire after the murder
to destroy the evidence,

33
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,840
there should have been

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
traces of oil at the scene.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,540
There are indeed no traces of oil.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,120
But the Secret Investigation Unit thinks

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,750
the oil might have been cleaned up

38
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,960
by Constable Zhong.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
But

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,150
before she could escape,

41
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,680
she was caught red-handed.

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,450
fought with Xueman before he died.

44
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,680
Do you smell

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
something strange?

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,010
It smells so familiar.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,380
Don't sniff it!

48
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,150
This is the Seven-Star Powder
from Poison Valley.

49
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,120
The Seven-Star Powder?

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Once inhaled, you'll faint

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,440
within a few breaths.

52
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,960
It seems Constable Zhong

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,820
was indeed knocked out by Old Bug.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,960
If what Madman said is true,

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,240
that Constable Zhong passed out

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,770
soon after being poisoned,

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
she couldn't possibly have killed anyone,

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,630
let alone burned the body.

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,680
Isn't that evidence?

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,360
No.

61
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,960
They can claim

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,590
Xueman poisoned Old Bug.

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,070
There's something I don't understand.

64
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,200
There are so many ways to kill someone.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,300
Why did the murderer have to burn him?

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,260
Feng Qingzhuo.

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,220

Smell this.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,930
This is strange.

70
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,480
Burnt grass

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,810
should smell scorched.

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,750
Placed next to a corpse,

73
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,270
it should reek of decay.

74
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,120
But this only

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,850
gives off a sickly sweet scent.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,850
Where does the smell come from?

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,659
We still need to examine the body.

78
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,159
But Old Bug's body

79
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,800
was taken away
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

80

81

storm in and examine it.

You're the real madman.

83
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,830
You think the Secret Investigation Unit

84
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,070
is a place you can just walk into?

I didn't expect that Old Bug

actually saved you.

97

Old Bug was truly remarkable.

98

Old Bug was obsessed with poison,

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
At the crime scene,

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,630
there was indeed no evidence

195
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,390
proving a third person was present.

196
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,440
So whether

197
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,480
you killed Old Bug or not,

198
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,080
you are the prime suspect.

199
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,550
This case is a big deal.

200
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,870
It won't drag on for long.

201
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,200
Once you're convicted,

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
as a constable,

203
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,150
you'll certainly be sentenced to death

204
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,480
for deliberately killing a key criminal.

205
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,860
Then why are you still wasting time here

206
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,100
with me?

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Just convict me already.

208
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,960
You will be convicted.

209
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,870
But what kind of conviction—

210
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,120
that's up to you, not me.

211
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,640
What do you mean?

212
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,870
Old Bug was a key criminal

213
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
and a villain.

214
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,300
His death is no loss.

215
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,270
If you sign the confession,

216
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,180
I can tell the Ministry of Justice

217
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,390
that you accidentally killed him

218
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,360
in self-defense during the arrest.

219
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,030
Then you'll get a lighter sentence.

220
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,120
Is this how the Secret Investigation Unit

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,840
handles cases?

222
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,750
Special cases, special measures.

223
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,030
If it weren't for you,

224
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,090
I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

225
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,090
[Confession: Criminal Zhong Xueman]

226
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,360
At the very least, it'll keep you alive.

227
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,960
Am I supposed to thank you for that?

228
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
Just remember it in your heart.

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,150
Put your fingerprint on it.

230
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,090
[Confessor]

231
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,230
It'll save your life.

232
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
You...

233
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,720
Black is black, and white is white.

234
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,690
I won't admit to something I didn't do.

235
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,910
At a time like this,

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,440
can't you be wiser?

237
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,870
As a constable,

238
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,210
I will never disregard justice.

239
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,480
As an individual,

240
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,790
I will never put self-preservation

241
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,030
above principles.

242
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,670
But it's funny.

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,670
I discussed you with someone recently.

244
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,480
You discussed what about me?

245
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,840
Both you and another famed constable

246
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,030
of the Qi Kingdom

247
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,860
once had no moral boundaries,

248
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,480
using victims as bait to lure out killers.

249
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,750
Even though the cases

250
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,240
were solved that way,
what meaning would it have?

251
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,270
I never expected

252
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,390
that after all these years,

253
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,920
you haven't changed at all.

254
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,150
And you've become even more despicable,

255
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,410
not even caring about the truth anymore.

256
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,110
This is the Zhong Xueman I know.

257
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,650
You're the one who hasn't changed at all.

258
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,150
If you have nothing else to say,

259
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,870
leave.

260
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,690
I don't want to see you again.

261
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,030
Zhong Xueman,

262
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,440
this is your own choice.

263
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,390
Don't blame me.

264
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,030
We've still got night watch tonight.

265
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,510
When will

266
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,670
this kind of life ever end?

267
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,730
Stop complaining.

268
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,910
Once that woman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

269
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,710
confesses and admits her crime,

270
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,240
we'll be free.

271
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,480
Right?

272
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,280
You're right.

273
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,150
Let's go.

274
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,840
Let's go.

275
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
Who are you?

276
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I think you've got the wrong person.

277
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
That should do it.

278
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,550
We need to hurry,

279
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,840
or there'll be trouble if they wake up.

280
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,150
Here.

281
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,200
If they wake up, just have Madman

282
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,530
give them another dose.

283
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,330
Tong Shuang,

284
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,440
once you
enter the Secret Investigation Unit,

285
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,600
you must not say a word.

286
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,320
Why?

287
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,960
As long as you remain silent,

288
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,620
you won't give yourself away.

289
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,480
Got it?

290
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,360
Got it.

291
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,120
Today,

292
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,510
I'm going to be a cicada in winter.

293
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,210
What does that mean?

294
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,510
Completely silent.

295
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
I'll wait here.

296
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,880
If anything goes wrong,

297
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I'll find a way to send you a message.

298
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,870
Okay.

299
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,550
Let's go.

300
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,150
Madman.

301
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,670
We won't get discovered, will we?

302
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,480
Stop talking.

303
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:25,630
[A16]

304
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,150
Come.

305
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,080
Hurry.

306
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,840
Oh no, Zhuge Kongyun.

307
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,550
Smell this.

308
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,550
This smell is very familiar.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,810
It's a bit sickly sweet,

310
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,790
like the fragrance

311
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,030
of burning oil blended with spices.

312
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,150
Never mind.

313
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,420
Let's take it back and study it first.

314
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,440
Young Master, you're back.

315
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,180
Why isn't there anyone on watch?

316
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,910
Yeah.

317
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,910
Tonight, it should be

318
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,260
Dong Liang and Wang Lang on duty.

319
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,240
Where are they?

320
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,390
Step aside!

321
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,200
I am General Huo's daughter.

322
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,030
Go out

323
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,910
and see what's happening.

324
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,600
Yes.

325
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,390
Young Master,

326
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,040
there's a drunk person
causing trouble at the gate.

327
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,150
So noisy.

328
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,240
Just send her away.

329
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,900
She isn't an ordinary person.

330
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,260
Maybe you should go take a look yourself.

331
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,240
Step aside!

332
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,200
-That was our last bottle of wine.
-How dare you block my way?

333
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,240
We really don't have any more wine.

334
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,720
-I'm General Huo's daughter.
-Please stop causing trouble.

335
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,150
How dare you!

336
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,080
What are you doing?

337
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,600
I want to see Zhuge Kongyun!

338
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,660
What are you doing?

339
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
Miss Huo.

340
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,630
Zhuge Kongyun,

341
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,130
I want to see Zhong Xueman.

342
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,080
Miss Huo, you must be drunk.

343
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,600
I'm not drunk.

344
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,030
I said I want to see Zhong Xueman.

345
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,270
Zhong Xueman is a suspect.

346
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,600
You can't see her
just because you want to.

347
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,240
She's innocent.

348
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
What right do you have to imprison her?

349
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,320
Whether she's innocent or not

350
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,650
isn't for you to decide.

351
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,630
What do you take

352
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,630
the Secret Investigation Unit for?

353
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,840
If you don't leave now,

354
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,270
don't blame me

355
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,600
for not showing respect to the Huo family.

356
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Very good.

357
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,030
If you dare,

358
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,690
just try laying a finger on me!

359
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,270
I...

360
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,890
Where did you two go?

361
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Zhuge Kongyun!

362
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,270
I said

363
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,030
I want to see Zhong Xueman.

364
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
What are you two standing there for?

365
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,940
Get her out of here now.

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,790
Okay. Okay.

367
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,030
Don't touch me.

368
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,830
Don't touch me.

369
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,830
I'll settle this with you later.

370
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,270
Young Master,

371
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,960
I think I'd better get you

372
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,930
clean clothes and shoes first.

373
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,150
Young Master.

374
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,910
Young Master,

375
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,480
I'll take your clothes

376
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,740
and shoes to be washed.

377
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,400
Young Master.

378
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,630
Young Master.

379
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,110
Didn't you two

380
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,480
go send her away?

381
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,690
What happened?

382
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,590
Send her away?

383
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,000
We were attacked by thugs during the day

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
and lost consciousness.

385
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,830
When we woke up,
we were in a residential house.

386
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,290
And our clothes and tokens

387
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,750
were stolen.

388
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,750
Yes.

389
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,720
We figured something must be wrong,

390
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,120
so we rushed back
to report to Young Master.

391
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,820
Then those two men just now...

392
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,720
Thankfully, Miss Huo was quick-witted.

393
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,110
Otherwise, we would have been in trouble.

394
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,440
It wasn't my fault.

395
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,750
I did exactly as Dairong told me.

396
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,680
I didn't say a word.

397
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,140
I only used sign language.

398
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,090
How did the autopsy go?

399
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,000
Look.

400
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,920
What is this?

401
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,160
I don't know.

402
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,880
It was found

403
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,590
on Old Bug's corpse.

404
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,480
This smell

405
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,110
is extremely similar

406
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,640
to the smell of those weeds we found

407
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,300
at the Yaksha Temple that day.

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,270
There's indeed something strange

409
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,640
about his corpse.

410
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,400
Yun,

411
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,830
Old Bug is dead.

412
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
There are only two days left.

413
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,830
How should we explain

414
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,240
to His Majesty?

415
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,680
If we want to save

416
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,030
our lives

417
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,590
and the future
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

418
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,070
there's only one way now.

419
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,110
What's that?

420
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,510
Zhong Xueman.

421
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,680
But... But there are still

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,810
many unresolved aspects in this case.

423
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,400
Then Father, please find a way

424
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,830
to pin all the charges

425
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,630
on Zhong Xueman within two days.

426
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,480
We already found Old Bug

427
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
within three days,

428
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,400
but he was killed by Zhong Xueman.

429
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,030
So we shouldn't be blamed.

430
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,750
As long as Zhong Xueman is convicted,

431
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,110
we'll have an explanation for His Majesty.

432
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,170
Tomorrow morning,

433
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,060
tell the Elite Constabulary Unit

434
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,530
to jointly interrogate Zhong Xueman.

435
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,480
Zhong Xueman,

436
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,200
I have investigated

437
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,930
the entire matter thoroughly.

438
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,310
All the evidence

439
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:42,050
[Upright and Honest]

440
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,920
shows that you killed Old Bug.

441
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,720
Do you have anything else to say?

442
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
I'll say it again—

443
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,400
I didn't kill him.

444
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,770
Claiming innocence requires evidence.

445
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,640
Do you have any evidence

446
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
to prove your innocence?

447
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,030
No.

448
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,270
Since you have no evidence

449
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,070
to prove your innocence,

450
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,350
we'll proceed according to the law.

451
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,160
Zhong Xueman, as a constable,

452
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,680
knowingly broke the law,

453
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,000
resorted to unauthorized punishment,

454
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,070
and cruelly killed a key criminal.

455
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,880
That's an extremely heinous act.

456
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,110
She should be sentenced to death.

457
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,960
Zhong Xueman's crime
doesn't warrant death, right?

458
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,750
That's right.

459
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,960
It's not that serious.

460
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,750
Indeed.

461
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,850
Zhong Xueman's motive for killing
is insufficient.

462
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,200
This conviction

463
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,650
seems rather hasty, doesn't it?

464
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,270
We all know

465
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,750
Zhong Xueman's temperament.

466
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,750
Old Bug was connected to Yesha,

467
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,440
and Yesha is the murderer

468
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
of Zhong Xueman's father.

469
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,200
It's entirely possible
she'd take the law into her own hands.

470
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,270
That's her motive for killing.

471
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,640
Not just that.

472
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
From what I know,

473
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,240
it has something to do with Zhong Xueman

474
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,920
that the Yesha case remains unsolved.

475
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Zhuge Tong,

476
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,680
don't you think

477
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,590
you're talking nonsense?

478
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,400
Since the Yesha case,

479
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,790
the corpse-sewing case,

480
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,990
the Huo Zongyao case,

481
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,030
the Chu Guangsha case,
and the Yellow Heaven case

482
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,880
are all related to Yesha.

483
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,750
Or rather,

484
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,350
they were committed
by Yesha's subordinates.

485
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,400
And the culprits?

486
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,810
Xiao Beiming's whereabouts are unknown.

487
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,000
Huang Wuchang was taken away.

488
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,270
The other criminals we could arrest

489
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,640
committed suicide to escape punishment.

490
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,590
Who investigated

491
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,750
all those cases?

492
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,790
You already know the answer.

493
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,650
Of course it was Constable Zhong.

494
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,830
So you do know it was Constable Zhong.

495
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
In the corpse-sewing case,

496
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,110
Xiao Beiming escaped

497
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,170
by jumping off the cliff
right in front of Zhong Xueman.

498
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,310
Then he showed up again

499
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,110
to poison Mr. Shen Bi to death.

500
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,750
Then he disappeared.

501
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,160
In the Huo Zongyao case,

502
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,270
a maid from Huo Mansion

503
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,960
was Xiao Beiming's subordinate.

504
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Right in front of Zhong Xueman,

505
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,720
a skilled fighter,

506
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,440
she managed to snatch a blade
and kill herself.

507
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,750
Huang Wuchang was taken away.

508
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,960
But before he was handed over

509
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,070
to the Secret Investigation Unit,

510
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,680
he had been escorted by Zhong Xueman
the whole time.

511
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
It's possible she followed us secretly

512
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,110
and waited for the right moment to act.

513
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
We tracked down Old Bug,

514
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,550
and he also died

515
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,640
in front of her.

516
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,000
Were all those things

517
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,110
just coincidences?

518
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,190
I have reason to suspect

519
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,400
that Zhong Xueman has been helping

520
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Yesha, Xiao Beiming, commit his crimes.

521
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,030
After all, Xiao Beiming

522
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,480
and Zhong Xueman
are childhood sweethearts,

523
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,510
and he was her husband.

524
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,310
Zhuge Tong...

525
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,720
I believe

526
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,720
Zhong Xueman has deliberately obstructed
the Yesha case's investigation

527
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,160
and committed murder.

528
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,900
Her crimes are unforgivable!

529
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,270
Zhuge Tong,

530
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,640
your words are baseless,

531
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,070
and you're making false accusations!

532
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,640
You're using such far-fetched reasons

533
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,750
to hastily convict Constable Zhong.

534
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,850
I'm afraid you have selfish reasons.

535
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,310
Chief Fang,

536
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,240
do not slander me.

537
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,070
Zhong Xueman

538
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,130
is from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

539
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,350
You're disregarding the law

540
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,310
and shielding her here publicly.

541
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,590
Who has selfish reasons here?

542
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,970
Even if Zhong Xueman is guilty,

543
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,200
this is a special case,

544
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,960
and her identity is special.

545
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,920
Shouldn't we detain her,

546
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,550
report to the higher-ups step by step,

547
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,310
and wait for His Majesty's approval

548
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,110
before sentencing her according to law?

549
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,590
That won't be necessary.

550
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,850
What do you mean?

551
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,270
Since she's been convicted,
and the case has been closed,

552
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,200
there's no need to detain her.

553
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
There are still four hours

554
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
until noon.

555
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Once it's noon,

556
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,160
we'll just execute her in public.

557
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Zhuge Tong, have you lost your mind?

558
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
Do you have a problem with that?

559
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,570
According to the Qi Kingdom's law,

560
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,270
even if the case is closed,

561
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,070
and the criminal is sentenced to death,

562
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,600
[Upright and Honest]

563
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,270
we must report three times

564
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,070
and wait for His Majesty's final decision

565
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,510
before the execution date is set!

566
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,960
Don't you think you're being absurd?

567
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,530
[Imperial: Annihilate the Evil]

568
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Absurd?

569
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,250
His Majesty has allowed

570
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,070
the Secret Investigation Unit
to handle the Yesha case

571
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,070
under special procedures.

572
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,880
For anyone related to the Yesha case,

573
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,960
no court trial is required.

574
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,640
Once they're convicted in the joint trial,

575
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,300
execution can be carried out
before reporting.

576
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,510
Chief Fang,

577
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,730
do you have any objections?

578
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,550
Chief Zhuge,

579
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,280
is this how you handle cases?

580
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,550
The Elite Constabulary Unit

581
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,270
sharing a reputation
with the Secret Investigation Unit

582
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,720
is a disgrace!

583
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,200
At the third quarter past noon,

584
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,350
the criminal, Zhong Xueman,
shall be executed in public

585
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,110
to purge evil deeds!

586
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,880
Well, Beiming,

587
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,250
have you figured it out?

588
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,180
At the crime scene,

589
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,270
there indeed wasn't
a third person present.

590
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,070
Constable Zhong
couldn't possibly be the killer.

591
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,550
Something terrible has happened!

592
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,350
Beiming.

593
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
What happened?

594
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,270
The Secret Investigation Unit has finished
interrogating Constable Zhong.

595
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,070
They're going to behead her in public
at the third quarter past noon.

596
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,070
Uncle!

597
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,200
Uncle!

598
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,070
Chief!

599
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,240
Uncle!

600
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
He should be in the study.

601
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's go.

602
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,510
Uncle!

603
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,240
At a time like this,

604
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,000
how can you still be in the mood

605
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,880
to draw that?

606
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,270
Chief,

607
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,310
the case hasn't been fully investigated.

608
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,030
How can they convict her
and set the execution date?

609
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,480
That old bastard Zhuge Tong—

610
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,960
this's a blatant disregard for human life!

611
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
And this isn't just targeting Xueman.

612
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,400
He's bullying

613
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
the Elite Constabulary Unit!

614
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,030
Zhuge Tong has an imperial jade pendant.

615
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,440
What do you want me to do?

616
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,590
Defy orders?

617
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,550
We still can't let him

618
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,400
bully the Elite Constabulary Unit
like this.

619
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,440
If word gets out,

620
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,270
how are we supposed
to show up in public after this?

621
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,870
We'll be the laughingstock!

622
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,210
There's nothing we can do now.

623
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,760
Things have come to this point.

624
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,770
Do you expect me

625
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,370
to lead all our men

626
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,270
with weapons

627
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
to storm the execution ground?

628
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,850
Fang Tianzheng!

629
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,270
Don't forget

630
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,920
we watched

631
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,110
Zhong Xueman

632
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,110
grow up.

633
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Uncle,

634
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,400
stop drawing!

635
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,860
Can't you think straight?

636
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
How dare you!

637
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,680
Is that how you speak to me?

638
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,880
I, Fang Yin, have never amounted to much.

639
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,880
Zhong Xueman has always looked down on me.

640
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,940
But this is the Elite Constabulary Unit.

641
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,790
We are constables.

642
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,040
When we're bullied or mocked

643
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,270
in normal times,

644
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,680
we can swallow it

645
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,680
and tolerate it.

646
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,080
But at a moment like this,

647
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,440
are we still going

648
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,700
to keep swallowing it and tolerating it?

649
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,680
Even if the wrongfully accused

650
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,810
isn't Zhong Xueman,

651
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,550
it's still a human life!

652
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,200
-Chief.
-Chief.

653
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,160
Isn't that Constable Zhong

654
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

655
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,450
How did she end up like this?

656
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,790
I heard she killed someone

657
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,400
and will be publicly beheaded.

658
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,530
She killed someone?

659
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,200
How could Constable Zhong kill anyone?

660
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,550
Who can say for sure?

661
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,590
Her senior is a wanted criminal.

662
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
What's so strange

663
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,320
about her killing someone?

664
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,070
Constable Zhong would never kill anyone.

665
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,200
She's a good person.

666
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,440
She must have been wrongfully accused.

667
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,680
The Elite Constabulary Unit
has been corrupt for ages.

668
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,000
Who knows how many criminals

669
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
they've failed to catch?

670
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,960
Say one more word

671
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,220
and I'll rip your mouth open!

672
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,090
You slapped me? You shrew!

673
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,070
I...

674
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,920
Bro. Bro.

675
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,850
It hurts.

676
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,510
Get lost!

677
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
Okay.

678
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,830
What are you doing?

679
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,310
We're going to rescue Constable Zhong.

680
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,070
Even if it costs us our lives,

681
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,350
we must save her.

682
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,350
You can't save her this way.

683
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,280
You'll just die for nothing.

684
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,240
But we can't just

685
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,000
watch her get beheaded.

686
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,550
Let's go.

687
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,070
Now, only one person

688
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,790
can save her.

Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

733
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,200
Don't look at me like that.

734
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,920
You brought this upon yourself.

735
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,790
You're despicable.

736
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,070
Chief, it's almost time.

737
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,960
Proceed with the execution.

738
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,000
[Behead]

739
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,550
Stop!

740
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,150
Chief Fang,

741
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,760
why have you brought your men

742
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,920
from the Elite Constabulary Unit here?

743
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,150
Planning to storm the execution ground?

744
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,150
Zhuge Tong,

745
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,610
I advise you not to be so despicable!

746
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,800
And leave yourself a way out!

747
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,900
The case against Zhong Xueman

748
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,230
is riddled with doubts,

749
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,190
yet you've acted unjustly and unlawfully,

750
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,710
defying reason and justice!

751
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,360
Your conduct is worse
than that of a beast!

752
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,030
I've already reported to His Majesty,

753
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,290
and he will punish you!

754
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,230
Has His Majesty replied?

755
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,440
You want His Majesty to punish me.

756
