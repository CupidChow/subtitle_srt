Confess!

7
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,590
Chu Guangsha's matter

8
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,990
has nothing to do with me.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,730
If it has nothing to do with you,

10
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,280
then why did you escape at night?

11
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,750
I just went down the mountain
to enjoy the moonlight.

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,000
Is that a crime too?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,130
You're still lying.

14
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,710
Do you think

15
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,840
we wouldn't find out about

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
you delivering pills on horseback?

17
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Riding to Guangsha Villa

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,750

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,070
two hours of travel time.

20
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,120
Where did you go

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,450
during these two hours?

22
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,470
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

23
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,290
Still won't talk, huh?

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,150
I'll talk!

25
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,950
I'll tell you.

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,770
Where did you go?

27
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,310
I went to have a meal.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,310
Just a meal, that's all.

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Still not telling the truth?

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,590
If it was just a meal,

31
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,560
why did you lie and deceive us?

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,910
I ate meat.

33
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,840
Qingtai Mountain rules state

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,150
that disciples must practice austerity,

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,210
and eating meat is a major violation.

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,750
But I really couldn't control

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,150
my gluttony.

38
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,710
Every time I deliver pills,

39
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,800
I sneak to a restaurant to eat meat.

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,000
Since you broke the rules,

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
you can just leave the order,

42
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,590
so why choose to run away?

43
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,030
Our discipline is extremely strict.

44
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,310
If you break the rules,

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
you'll be caned.

46
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,470
I've broken the rules so many times.

47
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,710
Those dozens of strikes would cripple me,

48
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,910
if not kill me.

49
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,590
I was afraid you'd discover it
during your investigation.

50
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,910
How could I not run?

51
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,200
Which restaurant did you go to?

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,120
What's it called? Where is it?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,030
It's the Qingmu Inn,

54
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,440
not far from Qingtai Mountain.

55
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,800
The matter of Chu Guangsha's pills

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,310
truly has nothing

57
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,470
to do with me at all.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Everything I've said is true.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,240
If needed,

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,970
the innkeeper can vouch for me.

61
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,040
Come with me.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,910
Repeat what you

63
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,710
just said.

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,510
He just went to a restaurant?

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,560
He didn't seem

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,950
to be lying,

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,800
and he has no motive

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,190
to kill Chu Guangsha.

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,190
If what he said was true...

70
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,310
If the restaurant was crowded

71
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,120
and Immortal Jiu's attention

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,950
was on that fish dish or whatever,

73
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,000
the pill could easily

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,600
have been switched

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,930
when he wasn't looking.

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm getting

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,020
more and more confused

78
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,950
about this case.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,750
Chu Guangsha and General Huo

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,610
were comrades,

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,390
yet they mysteriously

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,920
had these financial dealings

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
and died one after another

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,120
with the same cause of death.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
It's baffling.

86
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,150
Doesn't that just mean

87
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,800
that the killer in both cases

88
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,750
is likely the same person?

89
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,190
Are you trying to say again

90
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,870
that it's Miss Huo?

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,750
Impossible.

92
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,600
If the pill

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,950
was switched

94
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,870
during delivery,

95
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,560
then Miss Huo

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,000
was with us the whole time,

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,860
so she had no opportunity to do it.

98
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,480
That's what puzzles me too.

99
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
I can't figure it out either.

100
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,120
Any findings from the Ghost Market?

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,650

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
The old man?

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,540
Couldn't find him.

104
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,080
But I found the Ghost Market's keeper.

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
What do you want?

106
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,310
Nothing much.

[Elite Constabulary Unit]

108
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,040
I just need to ask you something.

109
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,970
Speak honestly.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,750
She told me

111
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,280
that after the old man left,

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,760
he never showed up again.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,190
But I'm clever as a fox,

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
full of tricks.

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,190
I found this

116
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,390
in his medicine shop.

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,830
Madman,

118
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
you're the expert.

119
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,070
What do you think

120
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,130
this symbol means?

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,120
This...

122
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,270
It's just an ordinary personal seal.

123
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,680
Exactly as I suspected.

124

Beiming,

125
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,120
I'll immediately find someone

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,040
to track down this seal.

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
If similar medicine bottles

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
appear in the capital,

129
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,430
I'll know right away.

130
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,070

Remember, investigate discreetly.

Don't alert our targets.

Aren't you taking this?

if that restaurant Immortal Jiu mentioned

140
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,190
actually exists.

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
How's your investigation going?

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,950
The pill made by the old Immortal Master

148
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,680
from Qingtai Mountain

149
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,270
and the one Chu Guangsha actually took

150
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,150
are completely different.

151
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,550
The problem occurred during the delivery.

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,120
That day,

153
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,430
I was with you the whole time

154
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,120
and had no chance to switch the pills.

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,950
So now, my suspicion

156
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,920
can be cleared, right?

157
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Of course,

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,090
we're both your witnesses.

159
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,120
Miss Huo,

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,140
do you recognize this symbol?

161
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,600
Now that he's gone,

162
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,800
Madam, you don't have to

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
stay up and make tea for him anymore.

164
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
It's useless to keep this teabag.

165
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
I'll throw it away.

166
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
I remember.

167
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
The pills that doctor gave my mother

168
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,250
had the same symbol on them.

169
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,320
The box is still at the Huo Mansion.

170
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,000
So you're saying

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,680
that doctor has something to do with

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,940
Chu Guangsha's death?

173
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,510
What's wrong with these account books?

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Solving crimes isn't my specialty,

175
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,390
but I've finished

176
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,720
reviewing these accounts.

177
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,000
On the surface,

178
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,310
Guangsha Villa's accounts

179
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,640
seem perfectly normal.

180
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,480
But Chu Guangsha's private ledger

181
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,610
has a hidden secret.

182
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
What secret?

00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,750
I've just asked around.

Chu Guangsha

188
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,750
took the so-called immortality pill

189
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,680
and suddenly died

190

right in front of everyone.

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,830
Where did the immortality pill come from?

195
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,890
Qingtai Mountain.

196
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,160
He doesn't eat outside?

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,120
He doesn't eat outside.

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
This way, please.

199
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,390
As you know,

200
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,180
[Qingmu Inn]

201
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,160
Immortal Masters cannot consume meat.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,600
Immortal Jiu fears being seen by others.

203
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,270
On the 15th of each month,

204
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,310
he enters through this back door

205
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,560
directly into this room.

206
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,760
This back door is normally kept closed.

207
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,700
He sits right in this spot.

208
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
I always

209
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,770
prepare his favorite dishes in advance.

210
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,270
After the meal...

211
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,150
This way, please.

212
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,000
After the meal,

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,960
he leaves directly through the back door.

214
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
He mounts the horse

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,660
I prepare for him and departs.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,270
You're quite meticulous in your work.

217
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,390
It seems Immortal Jiu

218
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,190
must be quite generous with you.

219
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,670
Oh, it's nothing.

220
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,330
Nothing worth mentioning.

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,510
From what you're saying,

222
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,390
Immortal Jiu

223
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,000
really doesn't come into contact
with many people.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's correct.

225
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,510
These contracts and receipts

226
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,440
are from the Ministry of War
and the Ministry of Works.

227
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
In the early years,

228
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,270
the borders of Qi Kingdom were unstable

229
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,320
and had frequent battles.

230
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Guangsha Villa first made its fortune

231
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,670
by trading ironware.

232
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,120
These were

233
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
all sold to the Ministry of War
and the Ministry of Works.

234
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,870
Why did the ministries

235
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,080
need ironware for?

236
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,270
To make weapons.

237
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,600
This also included

238
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,320
General Huo's authorization.

239
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,120
General Huo had always
worked in the Ministry of War,

240
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,910
while Chu Guangsha

241
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,840
was once under General Huo's command,

242
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,440
so he must've been involved.

243
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,550
That's an abuse of power.

244
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,390
The army needed weapons.

245
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,510
As long as the quality was good

246
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,600
and the price was fair,

247
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,630
what's wrong with that?

248
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,150
Then Chu Guangsha

249
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,150
regularly transferring money
to the Huo household

250
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,610
is certainly suspicious.

251
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,720
What other issues are in these ledgers?

252
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,550
Later,

253
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,670
Guangsha Villa's business

254
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,670
grew larger and larger,

255
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,400
and their wealth accumulated.

256
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,100
But I discovered that,

257
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,840
besides the money sent to
the Huo household,

258
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Guangsha Villa

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
also transferred a large sum

260
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,270
to Weizhou.

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,270
Weizhou?

262
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,000
The ledgers don't show

263
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
where exactly in Weizhou

264
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,060
or who received the money.

265
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,510
How did Weizhou

266
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,750
get involved in this?

267
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,550
I can't figure it out either.

268
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,080
Chu Guangsha sending money to my dad

269
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,150
makes some sense,

270
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,480
but such a large sum

271
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
transferred to Weizhou,

272
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,150
without any

273
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,480
business connections,

274
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,030
is truly puzzling.

275
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,750
Investigating Chu Guangsha's death

276
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,010
might give us answers.

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,200
Matches what I found.

278
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,120
Immortal Jiu said that during the meal,

279
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,630
the pill was with him the entire time,

280
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,390
he didn't drink alcohol,

281
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,670
and had no contact with other customers.

282
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,910
In such circumstances,

283
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,840
trying to secretly

284
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
swap the pill he was carrying

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,600
seems completely impossible.

286
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,870
This is very strange.

287
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,910
What should we do now?

288
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,670
Let's go.

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
It's almost time.

290
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,030
Where to?

291
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,160
We'll retrace the pill's delivery path.

292
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,360
[Baiyun Temple]

293
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,630
Even if we need to investigate,

294
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,200
is it really necessary

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,510
to retrace the steps in person?

296
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,320
It'll take several hours.

297
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,000
If we don't walk it ourselves,

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,480
how can we spot anything suspicious?

299
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,200
Let's go.

300
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,390
Hey,

301
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,320
you're still suspecting Miss Huo?

302
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,390
[Qingyun Terrace]

303
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,750
This is where Immortal Jiu

304
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,750
always stops

305
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,030
when delivering the pill.

306
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,630
He always dines in this room.

307
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
If what he says is true,

308
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,750
he really doesn't come into contact
with many people.

309
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,360
Indeed.

310
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,150
There are very few travelers
on this route.

311
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,630
Besides, Immortal Jiu keeps the pill

312
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,630
in his pocket at all times.

313
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,200
Even if the greatest thief alive tried,

314
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,360
it would be impossible to switch them

315
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,620
without him noticing.

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,180
Change horses.

317
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,800
Let's go to Guangsha Villa.

318
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,720
The time matches.

319
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,630
My Lords,

320
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,600
is there anything

321
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I can help you with?

322
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Steward Li,

323
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,550
could you tell us

324
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,840
if Mr. Chu always personally received

325
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,750
the pill upon delivery?

326
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes,

327
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,350
every single time, without exception.

328
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,390
Then where would Mr. Chu go

329
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,440
after receiving it?

330
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,630
Mr. Zhuge,

331
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,360
the questions you're asking today

332
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,270
were already

333
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,340
asked yesterday by Officer Zhong

334
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,790
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

335
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,670
Moreover,

336
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,920
she arrested one of my disciples away.

337
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm sorry.

338
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,220
Could you tell me again

339
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,670
in detail what happened?

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,340
Please come in.

341
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,120
The officials have ordered

342
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,550
that until the case is solved,

343
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,120
none of us are allowed in here.

344
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,870
So after Mr. Chu's death,

345
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
all these doors have been kept locked.

346
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Steward Li,

347
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,510
may I take a look inside?

348
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Please go ahead, My Lord.

349
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,910
Steward Li,

350
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,510
may I open this?

351
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,970
As you wish, My Lord.

352
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,080
The items in the chest

353
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
should be what Mr. Chu had used

354
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,660
for worshipping deities.

355
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,030
This must be the box

356
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,470
that held the immortality pill, right?

357
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,530
That's correct.

358
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Why have you

359
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,720
come back again?

360
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,750
Miss Huo,

361
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,350
what's going on here?

362
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,390
Since we buried Madam,

363
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,000
I've dismissed

364
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
all the servants.

365
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,360
The disciples

366
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,340
have all gone to join the army too.

367
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,600
I plan to sell this mansion

368
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
and find a smaller place

369
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,660
for Qing Ying and myself to settle in.

370
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,750
Is there new progress in the case?

371
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,360
We came here

372
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,890
precisely for that matter.

373
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,270
Please, go ahead.

374
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,910
Regarding Chu Guangsha's death,

375
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,010
we've actually been under a misconception

376
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:37,720
all this time,

377
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,550
believing that the pill

378
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,440
was switched during delivery.

379
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,670
If that were true,

380
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,360
then you, Miss Huo,

381
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,670
would be completely above suspicion.

382
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,200
But it wasn't until

383
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,630
I found this box

384
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,120
in Chu Guangsha's room

385
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,600
that I understood

386
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,060
the killer's true method.

387
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,200
What's wrong with this box?

388
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,240
Open it.

389
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,070
How is this possible?

390
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,030
Close it and open it again.

391
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,550
It's a mechanism box?

392
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,270
Exactly.

393
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
The killer only needed to

394
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,840
place the poison inside beforehand

395
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,550
and deliver it to Qingtai Mountain.

396
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,200
When the old Immortal Master opened it,

397
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,150
he thought it was empty,

398
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,550
so he put the pill inside.

399
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,550
But as soon as the box was closed,

400
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,670
the mechanism automatically

401
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,600
pulled the top layer to the bottom.

402
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,360
When it was delivered to Chu Guangsha,

403
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,510
he could only see

404
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,710
the poison in the box.

405
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,080
So you're saying

406
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,510
the pill was switched

407
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,040
right when it was produced?

408
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Then let's quickly find out

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
who made this box.

410
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,510
Chu Guangsha had specifically ordered

411
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,390
a jade shop to produce these jade boxes.

412
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,790
This is the box we got

413
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,840
from the shop.

414
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
I've examined it.

415
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,460
It's just an ordinary box.

416
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,840
If the box isn't the issue,

417
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,270
then how did this mechanism box

418
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,080
get delivered to

419
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,270
the old Immortal Master?

420
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,080
It's simple.

421
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,120
It's just like the principle
of this mechanism box,

422
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,790
hiding the truth in plain sight.

423
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,080
Early morning on the 15th of each month,

424
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,150
I promptly deliver the box
to Qingtai Mountain

425
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,600
before the immortality pill is ready.

426
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
Where on Qingtai Mountain?

427
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,120
At the foot of the mountain.

428
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,580
An Immortal Master comes down
to receive it.

429
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,670
The box was indeed

430
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,320
delivered early morning
on the 15th every month.

431
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
The owner of the jade shop

432
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,080
personally delivered it
to the foot of the mountain.

433
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
But yesterday,

434
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,840
it was just a servant
who delivered the box.

435
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,300
They came up the mountain.

436
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,440
Up the mountain?

437
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,590
That's right.

438
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,030
As soon as I left the temple,

439
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,800
[Baiyun Temple]

440
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,510
I ran into him here.

441
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,670
I thought at the time

442
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,300
they might be a new worker.

443
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,390
They saved me the trouble of going down.

444
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,390
I understand now.

445
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,550
The person delivering the box

446
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,960
delivered it to the foot of the mountain,

447
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,200
but the person receiving it

448
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,080
got it at the entrance
of Qingtai Mountain.

449
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,510
The culprit first disguised themself

450
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,000
as an Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain,

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
deceiving the jade shop owner

452
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,320
at the foot of the mountain.

453
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,670
Then they disguised themself as a worker,

454
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,270
delivering the mechanism box

455
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,150
to the Immortal Master
at Qingtai Mountain.

456
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,600
What a clever deception!

457
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,080
You're indeed clever.

458
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,960
But even if we know how it was done,

459
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
we still can't identify
who the culprit is.

460
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,720
Not necessarily.

461
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,040
You know who the culprit is?

462
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,030
Miss Huo,

463
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,859
how much longer
are you planning to keep hiding?

464
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,750
[Baiyun Temple]

465
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,350
You still suspect me?

466
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,960
The day Chu Guangsha died,

467
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,400
I was

468
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,550
with you the entire time.

469
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,550
Aren't you mistaken?

470
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,310
No, we aren't.

471
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,160
Miss Huo,

472
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
do you remember what happened

473
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,310
when we first went to

474
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,370
Qingtai Mountain?

475
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
So you're saying

476
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,200
the only people who had access
to the immortality pill

477
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
were the old Immortal Master,

478
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,030
you, and Chu Guangsha?

479
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,110
No, Miss Huo,

480
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,270
I only delivered the pill.

481
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,270
I never actually touched it.

482
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,940
None of us

483
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,790
ever introduced ourselves

484
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,880
to Immortal Jiu,

485
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,270
yet he immediately addressed you

486
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,400
as Miss Huo.

487
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,510
This proves the people
of Qingtai Mountain

488
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,400
already knew you.

489
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,920
So I had Tong Shuang investigate

490
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,550
those servants

491
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,200
you dismissed from the Huo Mansion.

492
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,480
The people at the Huo Mansion said

493
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,210
that since Madam Feng fell ill,

494
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,880
you've been going to Qingtai Mountain

495
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
on the 15th of every month

496
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,310
to pray for Madam Feng's health.

497
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,200
Is this true?

498
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,590
If the pill was indeed

499
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,880
switched during delivery,

500
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
you wouldn't
have had the opportunity.

501
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,750
But if you went

502
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,440
to Qingtai Mountain early in the morning,

503
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
then rushed back to the Huo Mansion,

504
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,070
and finally joined us

505
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,400
to go to Guangsha Villa,

506
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,680
you could've made it in time

507
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,830
by riding quickly.

508
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,880
This...

509
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,270
The old Immortal Master also mentioned

510
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,350
that Chu Guangsha
had been taking this pill

511
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,310
for quite some time.

512
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,510
For someone who visits
Qingtai Mountain monthly,

513
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,240
you could

514
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,680
easily learn about

515
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,070
the pill delivery process.

516
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,000
Moreover,

517
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,720
your disguise skills

518
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,830
are unmatched.

519
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,480
Disguising as the old Immortal Master

520
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,510
or Immortal Jiu

521
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,830
is no challenge for you.

522
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,200
You used the pretext
of investigating your background

523
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,790
to come with us to Guangsha Villa.

524
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,680
It was just to make us

525
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,510
become your best alibis.

526
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,070
These are all your speculations.

527
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,110
You don't have any actual proof.

528
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,720
No.

529
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,020
There is evidence.

530
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,920
This Beauty Snow

531
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,480
has helped us greatly.

532
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,110
Do you still remember the Immortal Master

533
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,000
who picked up the box?

534
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,460
Could you recognize them?

535
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,000
I can't remember the face clearly,

536
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,790
but it's a different Immortal Master
who picks up the box

537
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,720
each time.

538
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,880
I remember

539
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,790
that Immortal Master had

540
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,920
a very strong

541
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,030
and distinctive scent of perfume powder.

542
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,720
Yes,

543
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,590
the person who delivered the box

544
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,590
had a distinctive perfume powder scent.

545
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,070
It was quite unique,

546
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,680
so I remember it clearly.

547
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,240
Is this the scent?

548
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,430
I was thinking at the time

549
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,880
that an Immortal Master from the mountain

550
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,110
should smell of incense.

551
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,270
How could they smell of perfume powder?

552
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,110
Strange.

553
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,930
Do you remember this scent?

554
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,440
Yes, that's right.

555
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,010
This is exactly the scent.

556
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Both the jade shop owner

557
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,680
and the Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain

558
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,350
have confirmed this scent.

559
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,510
Miss Huo,

560
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
what do you have to say for yourself?

561
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
You call this evidence?

562
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,270
Why would I kill Chu Guangsha?

563
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,720
It's a long story.

564
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,730
Maybe it's connected to Yesha.

565
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,310
Xiao Beiming,

566
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,830
are you insane?

567
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,420
Just to crack the case,

568
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,550
you're pinning the crimes of Yesha

569
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,480
on me?

570
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,550
Enough talk.

571
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,830
Come back to
the Elite Constabulary Unit with me.

572
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,680
No way.

573
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

574
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,550
Qing Ying.

575
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,160
She knows martial arts?

576
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,550
She's not the maid you thought you knew.

577
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,160
Qing Ying,

578
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,240
what's going on?

579
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,880
Since it's come to this,

580
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,110
stop resisting.

581
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,750
When did you

582
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,950
start suspecting me?

583
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,200
Your disguise was good,

584
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,830
but there were still a few flaws.

585
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,070
First, Madam Feng,

586
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,000
a mother who loved her daughter dearly,

587
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,070
would have been

588
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,070
most reluctant on her deathbed

589
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,750
to part with her daughter.

590
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,550
But with her

591
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,830
last breath,

592
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,290
she looked at you instead,

593
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,890
and entrusted her daughter to you.

594
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,550
Qing Ying.

595
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,000
Mom.

596
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,790
The lady

597
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,200
is in your hands now.

598
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,640
Please take good care of her.

599
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,310
Yes.

600
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,160
My instinct tells me

601
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,680
this wasn't just a simple request,

602
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,510
but a demand for your guarantee.

603
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
Because her daughter's life

604
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,510
is in your hands.

605
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,370
There were so many people present,

606
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,960
yet not one suspected me.

607
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,110
It was such a tiny flaw

608
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,400
and you still managed to spot it.

609
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,480
That's not all.

610
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,920
Everything we just told Miss Huo

611
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,070
was true.

612
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,830
However, besides Miss Huo,

613
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,230
there's someone else

614
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,920
who visits Qingtai Mountain every month.

615
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
And this person uses

616
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
the same perfume powder as Miss Huo.

617
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,270
This person

618
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,720
is the maid who is

619
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,480
always by her side

620
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,410
and doesn't arouse any suspicion.

621
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,750
Miss Huo,

622
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,110
does Qing Ying

623
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,310
also use Beauty Snow?

624
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,920
We've shared cosmetics since childhood.

625
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
People get used to their own scent

626
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,510
and don't notice the changes.

627
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,110
Miss Huo is currently in mourning

628
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,960
and doesn't use any perfume powder at all.

629
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
So this person

630
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,400
can only be you.

631
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,110
Since you all know already,

632
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,750
I have nothing more to say.

633
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,830
No!

634
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,030
Why did you kill Chu Guangsha

635
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,720
and Huo Zongyao?

636
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,270
Because they deserved to die.

637
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,530
Is it because of Haiya?

638
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,450
You're also an orphan from Haiya?

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,440
That's right.

640
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,350
Everything is proceeding

641
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,950
according to Master's plan.

642
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,200
But Xiao Beiming...

643
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,960
When the fish bites the bait,

644
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,680
they won't easily let go.

645
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,350
Continue as planned.

646
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,550
Yes.

647
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,290
What exactly happened

648
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,550
in Haiya back then?

649
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,580
Do you think I am

650
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,540
a spineless coward like Zhu Yitie?

651
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,070
I won't say anything.

652
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,750
Miss Huo,

653
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
don't be too sad,

654
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,430
Take care of your health.

655
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I never would have thought

656
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
it would be Qing Ying.

657
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,480
She's been by my side

658
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,400
for so long.

659
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,200
At least you're cleared of suspicion now,

660
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,030
right?

661
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,240
Did I say something wrong?

662
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,510
I'm sorry.

663
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,550
How's the interrogation going?

664
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,280
She refuses to say anything.

665
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,210
It makes sense.

666
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,620
They're all people
who aren't afraid to die.

667
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,360
What have you done to her?

668
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,240
Don't worry,

669
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,310
we haven't handed her

670
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,160
over to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

671
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,920
and we won't

672
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,180
use any torture on her.

673
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,240
But this can't go on forever.

674
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
That's why we've come to you.

675
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,200
Me?

676
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,440
But I don't know how to interrogate.

677
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,700
You don't need to know.

678
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,590
Miss Huo,

679
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,520
it's because you know her best.

680
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
Also,

681
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,790
you might be

682
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,590
the person she cares about most.

683
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,480
Constable Tong,

684
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,790
please leave us.

685
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,350
She won't hurt me.

686
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,480
Let me question her.

687
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,310
Be careful then.

688
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,750
Going to cry again?

689
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,640
I've told you before

690
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,830
that tears are the most useless things

691
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,400
in this world.

692
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,880
You lied to me

693
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,960
and to my mother

694
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,400
just to kill my father.

695
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
What is all of this?

696
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,590
Back when you were sold by a trafficker

697
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,610
and beaten black and blue

698
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,070
at the entrance of a brothel,

699
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,600
I was the one who rescued you
from that misery.

700
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,750
Though you were my maid,

701
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,110
my mother and I

702
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,000
never viewed you as a servant.

703
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
I even

704
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,730
treated you like my own sister.

705
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,640
How could you?

706
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
Why did you do it?

707
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,400
You didn't save me.

708
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,000
I let you save me.

709
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,070
I chose you.

710
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,110
Don't grab me!

711
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,170
Stop the nonsense.

712
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,750
We give her food and water.

713
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
Get in there right now!

714
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,310
Yeah!

715
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,270
Freeloading off others.

716
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,800
Because you and I are the same.

717
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,150
We're both orphans from Haiya.

718
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,790
Where exactly is Haiya?

719
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,620
Originally, I entered the Huo Mansion

720
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,230
to find a chance to tell you

721
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,800
about your true identity,

722
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,830
so you could make the right choice,

723
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,270
just like I did.

724
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,190
But I never expected

725
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,790
that Madam Feng was always there

726
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,650
to protect you,

727
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,140
making you so weak.

728
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,710
I thought

729
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,340
if both your parents left you,

730
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,740
you might become braver.

731
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,750
I never expected

732
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,350
that you would trust them again.

733
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,710
My mother's death

734
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,060
was also part of your plan?

735
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,580
That's right.

736
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,140
That limping physician

737
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,420
was introduced to Madam Feng by me.

738
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,750
In other words,

739
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,060
I had her put

740
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,870
the poisonous powder in your father's tea.

741
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,420
And I was the one

742
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,900
who ordered her to take the blame.

743
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,820
Why would she listen to you?

744
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,030
It's simple.

745
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,440
I just threatened her with your life.

746
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
For your sake,

747
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,100
she would do anything.

748
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,820
She didn't flinch even when I made her

749
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,270
commit suicide by poison that day.

750
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,820
Why on earth

751
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,860
would you do such evil things

752
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,030
and be so inhumane?

753
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,380
I'm not the inhumane one.

754
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,310
It's your father, Chu Guangsha,

755
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,550
and the Canfeng Army!

756
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,660
The evil I've done

757
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
doesn't amount to a sliver of

758
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,580
what those people did to Haiya back then.

759
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,190
I only did

760
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,750
what I had to do.

761
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
I only made them pay for their sins.

762
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,840
What's this Canfeng Army?

763
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,040
What are you talking about?

764
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,790
Never mind.

765
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,750
These are the things

766
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,140
you should know anyway.

767
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,860
All of you, come in.

768
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,620
You hypocrites from the Qi Kingdom,

769
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,380
listen carefully.

770
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,660
See how fake your so-called justice

771
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,660
and law really are.

772
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,990
Young Master.

773
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,310
I've learned that

774
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,230
today, Zhong Xueman

775
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,060
brought people to Guangsha Villa

776
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,660
and Qingtai Mountain again.

777
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,030
What is she...

778
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,270
She's investigating

779
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,400
the murderer who killed Chu Guangsha.

780
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,140
It could also be

781
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,510
the person who killed General Huo.

782
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,820
Wasn't General Huo's killer

783
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,950
Madam Feng?

784
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,480
Didn't Zhong Xueman say

785
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
she committed suicide out of guilt?

786
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,510
What she said
might not be the whole truth.

787
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,420
Then...

788
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,750
I know where to find her.

789
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,550
Follow me.

790
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,220
What is the Canfeng Army?

791
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
Haiya is on the border of Qi Kingdom.

792
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,480
On the 36th year of Ningtai,

793
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,750
the Qi Kingdom sent

794
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,790
a military unit called the Canfeng Army

795
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,060
to garrison Haiya.

796
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,480
Victory is ours!

797
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,140
Victory is ours!

798
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,750
[Canfeng Army]

799
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,000
Great! Great!

800
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,750
[Canfeng Army]

801
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,580
But unexpectedly,

802
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,140
as soon as the Canfeng Army
arrived in Haiya,

803
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,450
they turned their swords against

804
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,980
the local Haiya civilians.

805
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,690
In a single night,

806
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,790
all of Haiya was stained red with blood.

807
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,860
The defenseless people of Haiya

808
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,190
could only beg for mercy under

809
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,330
[Little Lone City]

810
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,120
the Canfeng Army's blades.

811
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,510
Yet they still couldn't escape

812
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,750
their tragic fates.

813
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,140
Among them

814
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,040
were my parents.

815
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,060
The Canfeng Army massacred a city?

816
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,790
How could the Qi Kingdom possibly do

817
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,250
such a thing to civilians?

818
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,670
You can believe it or not.

819
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,710
If your father and Chu Guangsha

820
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,040
were still alive today,

821
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,710
they wouldn't dare

822
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,110
confront me face to face,

823
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,550
because they were

824
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,710
members of the Canfeng Army.

825
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,310
If that's the case,

826
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,710
then the Canfeng Army's massacre

827
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,970
must have had a reason.

828
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,140
What was it?

829
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,550
I don't know.

830
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,470
I only know

831
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,750
the atrocities were committed
by the Canfeng Army!

832
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,340
Those who advised
the late emperor to massacre the city

833
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,000
were those high officials
from three years ago.

834
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,060
They deserved their deaths.

835
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,860
No matter the reason,

836
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,470
those who kill

837
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,820
must pay with their lives.

838
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,320
Especially when it was an entire city!

839
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,190
So I only need to

840
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,860
follow Master's plan

841
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,890
to make them pay with their lives.

842
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,760
I don't care about anything else.

843
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,030
Master?

844
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,900
You mean Yesha?

845
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,310
Of course.

846
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,660
Zhu Yitie said

847
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,310
Yesha most likely died three years ago

848
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,900
at Fengbo Lake.

849
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,950
Who ordered you

850
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,420
to kill Chu Guangsha

851
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,790
and Huo Zongyao?

852
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,160
How could Master possibly die?

853
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,550
Let me tell you.

854
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,620
Master is a god.

855
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,470
He is the faith and light

856
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,420
for all Haiya survivors.

857
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,030
He will never die.

858
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,310
He will always lead us

859
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,190
to live on

860
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,510
until the Qi Kingdom

861
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,060
pays the price it deserves.

862
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,860
Until we avenge

863
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,900
all the people of Haiya!

864
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,710
Qing Ying!

865
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,490
[As Boundless As the Sea and Sky]

866
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,190
[As Boundless As the Sea and Sky]

867
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,470
Stop right there!

868
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,070
The murderer?

869
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,560
Another suicide to escape punishment?

870
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,550
I'm too late again?

871
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,030
You've come at just the right time.

872
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,100
This case belongs to
your Secret Investigation Unit,

873
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,700
so you should

874
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,760
personally take the body back.

875
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,470
Come on.

876
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,840
Where is Zhong Xueman?

877
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,770
Constable Zhong has already left.

878
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,800
Tell her to come see me.

879
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,840
Right now!
