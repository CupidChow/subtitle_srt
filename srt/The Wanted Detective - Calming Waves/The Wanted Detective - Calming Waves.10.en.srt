How's your task going?

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,840
Everything is proceeding

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,170
according to your plan.

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,479

Xiao Beiming...

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,180
Once the fish bites,

8
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,039
it won't let go easily.

9
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,380
By the time it realizes,

10
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,870
the hook's already stuck.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,980
Continue as planned.

12
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,070
Yes.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,030
Xiao Beiming?

14
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,800
This game of chess

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,210

[Blessings and Longevity]

19
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,950
When Master was young

20
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,470
and fighting enemies on the battlefield,

21
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,940
he suffered many injuries

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,630
that left many lasting effects.

23
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,470
In daily life,

24
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,900
he uses these tonics

25
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,230
to maintain his health.

26
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,190
Miss Huo,

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,470
I'm a bit confused by what you said.

28
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,910
You're the only daughter
of the Huo family.

29
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,100
Who in this household could harm you

30
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,590
that it would actually

31
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,490
make you say "self-protection?"

32
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,150
You two came from

33
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,410
the central yard and the west courtyard.

34
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,400
Can't you see

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,680
how rundown the east courtyard is

36
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,190
by comparison?

37
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,960
I am indeed the only daughter
of the family,

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,750
but one no one cares about.

39
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Looks like Madam Feng is awake.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,430
Since she's awake,

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,750
may we see her?

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,150
Her health is poor.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,470
Now she's been overwhelmed with grief.

44
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,050
I'm afraid...

45
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,800
It's fine.

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,480
My Lords, please wait a moment.

47
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,270
Well?

48
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,290
Nothing I can tell for now.

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,950
We'll need to take all the medicine back

50
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,160
for testing

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,090
before I can draw any conclusions.

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,870
Where is Constable Zhong?

53
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,240
Constable Zhong and Constable Tong

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,560
are questioning someone
in the East Courtyard.

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,750
Constable Tong?

56
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,560
You've seen him before—

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,390
Tong Shuang.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,190
Let's go.

59
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,490
Take me to see them.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Wait.

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,190
I'll grab a few more bottles of medicine.

62
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,040
Better to test more.

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,500
I'll take that one too.

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,390
Let's go.

65
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,630
This way, please.

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
Why aren't they here yet?

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,190
It's about time.

68
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,050
The effects should be kicking in.

69
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Wait!

70
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,870
Coroner Feng, what's wrong?

71
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,130
I think I've forgotten

72
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,960
something.

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,190
What is it?

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,720
The token of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,870
Would you two mind

76
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,470
coming back with me to get it?

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,130
Let's go.

78
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,920
You can go back by yourself.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,750
This way.

80
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,750
Coroner Feng, are you alright?

81
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm fine.

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm alright.

83
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,240
Look at me.

84
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm so careless.

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,830
These are all pieces of evidence.

86
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,070
What should I do?

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm almost done here.

88
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,120
Are you...

89
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,390
Mr. Zhuge,

90
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,760
are you alright?

91
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,360
Mr. Zhuge,

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,870
are you okay?

93
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,880
Where's the toilet?

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,050
I'll take you there!

95
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,240
It's over there!

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,390
Feeling better?

97
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,120
Hurry up.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,170
You grieve so deeply

99
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,159
for General Huo.

100
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
It seems you two were very close.

101
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,870
Yes.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,480
He took me in as a concubine

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
after returning from the battlefield.

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,000
It's been 23 years now.

105
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,240
All these years,

106
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,080
we've treated each other with respect

107
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,510
and lived in harmony.

108
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,070
Now that he's gone,

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,310
my heart

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
aches terribly.

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
And that pain

112
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,000
made my body collapse.

113
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,600
Madam.

114
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,830
My mom

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,090
is very weak right now.

116
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,630
If you

117
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,159
don't have any more questions,

118
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,870
then...

119
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,630
Madam Feng, Miss Huo, thank you.

120
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,680
Sorry for troubling you for so long.

121
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
We should take our leave now.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,070
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

123
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,390
Please excuse me for not seeing you out.

124
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,560
Take care, My Lords.

125
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,850
Li Xiao took him to the latrine.

126
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,140
He won't be able to hold him much longer.

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,340
You have to leave now.

128
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
We'll stall Zhuge Kongyun.

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,510
Go now.

130
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,050
We'll meet later

131
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,110
at Sanli Teahouse.

132
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,360
Constable Tong.

133
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,750
Miss Huo.

134
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,890
Weren't you just

135
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,170
with Constable Zhong?

136
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,750
Why are you alone now?

137
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,390
I have something important to attend to

138
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,630
at the Elite Constabulary Unit.

139
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,560
Did you follow me here

140
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,580
because you had something to ask?

141
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,230
The more I think about it,

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,890
the more I believe
you're not Constable Tong,

143
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
but the old acquaintance

144
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I just mentioned.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,789
Miss Huo,

146
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,960
we've never met before.

147
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,360
You must have mistaken me
for someone else.

148
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,150
I have no great talents

149
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,320
and know little of martial arts,

150
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
but when it comes to disguises,

151
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,490
I know a thing or two.

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Besides,

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,030
those eyes of yours

154
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,200
are too familiar to me.

155
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,350
-So...
-Miss Huo, you've got the wrong person.

156
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,600
Long time no see,

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,750
Xiao Beiming.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We've met before?

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,630
I'm actually a little embarrassed
to admit it,

160
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,480
but I used to

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,150
admire Constable Xiao a lot.

162
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,960
I know all the cases you've solved

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,290
like the back of my hand.

164
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
I even sneaked to the gate

165
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,340
of the Elite Constabulary several times

166
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,180
to watch you.

167
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,700
Since you've

168
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,060
uncovered my identity,

169
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,870
aren't you afraid I'll silence you?

170
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,290
I don't believe you're Yesha.

171
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,630
Why?

172
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,000
Because Zhong Xueman

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
has always been by your side.

174
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You two are quite something,

175
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,940
coming up with such a plan.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
Beiming is indeed impressive.

177
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,600
He was always one step ahead

178
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
of Zhuge Kongyun.

179
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,970
Truly remarkable.

180
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
He's coming.

181
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,080
Mr. Zhuge,

182
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,710
what's wrong with you?

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Mr. Zhuge,

184
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,350
what happened to you?

185
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,840
This pill is called
the Taste-Blocking Pill.

186
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,750
After taking it,

187
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
a person's sense of taste and smell

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
will be blocked for an hour—

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
they won't be able to detect

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,670
any scent.

191
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,600
It'll make you more comfortable.

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,390
This isn't like

193
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,550
the Five-Blood Pill from last time, is it?

194
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,670
This pill is a unique formula

195
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,800
I developed myself.

196
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,440
I wouldn't

197
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,730
give it to just anyone.

198
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,220
You did this.

199
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,030
Me?

200
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,030
Why do you think so?

201
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,230
That pill...

202
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Look at me.

203
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,030
I forgot to tell you at the time.

204
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,840
The Taste-Blocking Pill

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,870
does block

206
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,240
your taste and smell,

207
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,390
but some people

208
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,680
might experience other symptoms.

209
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,890
What symptoms?

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,430
Non-stop diarrhea.

211
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,390
Come on.

212
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,560
How could you give Mr. Zhuge

213
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,320
something like this?

214
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,080
I didn't want to give it to him.

215
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,120
He couldn't stand the smell

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,910
of the autopsy,

217
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,240
so I gave it to him.

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,840
It's just an autopsy.

219
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,720
We're all constables.

220
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,320
Exactly.

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
You can't even handle this?

222
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,030
Right.

223
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,320
And you even need to take medicine?

224
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
You...

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,600
You...

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,080
It's alright, Mr. Zhuge.

227
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,810
You'll be fine once the diarrhea
has cleared up.

228
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,670
Once your diarrhea clears up tomorrow,

229
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,130
we can talk about the case.

230
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,320
If there's anyone in the world

231
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,410
who hates you most and wants to kill you,

232
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,370
it's her.

233
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,300
Yet she stays by your side,

234
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,600
taking risks with you.

235
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,580
That shows

236
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,250
you've earned her trust.

237
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,960
Since she can do it,

238
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
why can't I?

239
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,480
You really are smart.

240
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,550
To receive such praise from Constable Xiao

241
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,870
is a great honor.

242
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,080
However,

243
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,910
there's one thing
I still don't understand.

244
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,840
I hope you

245
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,070
can be honest with me.

246
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,960
Go ahead.

247
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,790
You're now a convicted man.

248
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,840
Why are you so invested

249
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,970
in my father's case,

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
even willing to risk your life

251
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,390
to investigate Huo Mansion?

252
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,750
There must be a reason.

253
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,670
Could it be

254
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,830
that my father's case

255
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,300
is related to Fengbo Lake?

256
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,600
That's right.

257
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,590
We found that General Huo

258
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,960
is connected to our leads.

259
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,270
But just as we arrived at Huo Mansion,

260
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,790
General Huo died mysteriously.

261
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
It's too coincidental,

262
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,520
naturally raising suspicion.

263
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,440
But...

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
But my father...

265
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,680
strangled himself to death.

266
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,000
You said yourself

267
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,330
that seeing isn't always believing.

268
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,960
My Lord.

269
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,730
Someone's coming.

270
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,670
There are guards ahead

271
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,580
and Zhuge Kongyun behind.

272
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,600
I have a plan. Follow me.

273
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,670
The Huo mother and daughter aren't simple,

274
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,150
especially Miss Huo.

275
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,060
She speaks with hidden meanings.

276
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,360
Really?

277
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,670
I think she's okay.

278
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,870
I've noticed you always

279
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,390
defend Miss Huo.

280
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,670
I don't think so.

281
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,670
Why hasn't Beiming returned yet?

282
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,320
Logically,

283
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,390
he left before us

284
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,790
and should be back by now.

285
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,670
Could something have happened?

286
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,360
Zhuge Kongyun discovered him?

287
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,480
Young Master, are you feeling better?

288
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,820
[Huo Mansion]

289
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
I'm fine now.

290
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,840
Mr. Zhuge, you should go back
and get some rest.

291
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,670
If you need anything,

292
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm at your service.

293
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,960
Uncle Wu,

294
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,560
why did you come to clean up at this hour?

295
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,790
Alright, just go now.

296
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,720
Why are you dressed like this?

297
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,840
Huo Dairong helped me disguise myself

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,270
to avoid

299
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,600
being discovered by Zhuge Kongyun.

300
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,360
Huo Dairong?

301
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,270
She?

302
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,160
She uncovered my identity.

303
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,600
She recognized you

304
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,100
and helped you escape?

305
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,320
You two really are old friends,

306
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,030
aren't you?

307
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,940
I really haven't seen her before.

308
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
I swear, I truly haven't.

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,390
Beiming,

310
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,960
so why did she help you?

311
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,250
She asked me to help uncover

312
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,310
the truth behind her father's death.

313
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,690
Her words aren't trustworthy.

314
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,070
That's right.

315
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,360
The Huo family is complicated.

316
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,790
Huo Dairong is extremely clever

317
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,840
and hard to read.

318
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,030
But for now, it seems

319
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,630
she doesn't mean me any harm.

320
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,750
In fact,

321
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,910
she even shared some clues

322
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,750
about her father's death.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,270
What clues?

324
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,070
Since you also believe

325
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,870
there's something suspicious
about General Huo's death,

326
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,390
I'm sure—given your intelligence—

327
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,520
you must already have someone in mind.

328
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Mrs. Huo.

329
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,670
Mrs. Huo?

330
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,520
That's right.

331
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,360
My father had a bad temper,

332
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,630
but he had never laid a hand on anyone.

333
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,750
Yet six months ago,

334
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,680
he suddenly started acting strangely.

335
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,160
He became increasingly violent

336
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,870
and would lash out

337
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,970
at the slightest displeasure.

338
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,780
As for my mom's illness...

339
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
rather than saying she fell ill
from grief,

340
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,270
it's more accurate to say

341
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,320
she was worn down by my father's abuse.

342
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
Then why do you suspect Mrs. Huo?

343
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
I consulted a physician.

344
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,390
If someone were of sound mind,

345
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,550
they would never treat

346
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,280
their own family that cruelly.

347
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,670
So I suspect

348
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
my father was poisoned.

349
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,480
Everything he ate, wore, or used—

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,720
including his medicine—

351
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,080
was managed by Mrs. Huo.

352
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,210
She's the most likely suspect.

353
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,750
But it's only a suspicion—

354
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,870
I have no proof.

355
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,790
That's why I want to investigate.

356
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
Huo Dairong said

357
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,870
Mrs. Huo was taken as General Huo's
second wife

358
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,840
five years ago,

359
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,200
when she was just 16.

360
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,820
What about his first wife?

361
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,920
His first wife

362
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
passed away five years ago

363
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,270
without leaving any children.

364
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,200
That day, when I observed Mrs. Huo,

365
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,510
I noticed her behavior was flippant—

366
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,960
not at all like a refined lady
from a noble family.

367
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,160
Huo Dairong also said

368
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
Mrs. Huo's father and brother

369
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,910
run a weapons workshop.

370
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,440
After she married into the family,

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,530
that workshop became

372
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,790
a designated supplier for the military.

373
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,910
Exchanging his own daughter's happiness

374
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,720
for wealth and status—

375
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,700
that's quite

376
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,840
a profitable deal.

377
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,000
Whether there was a deal
behind the scenes,

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,240
Miss Huo isn't sure.

379
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,930
She only said that

380
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,360
after Mrs. Huo married into the family,

381
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,390
she was never happy.

382
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,510
She was gloomy all day,

383
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,320
shut herself in,

384
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,510
and spoke to no one.

385
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,200
It wasn't until three years ago
that she seemed to get better

386
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,790
and began to smile a little.

387
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,200
Three years ago?

388
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,960
Huo Dairong harbors deep resentment

389
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,910
toward Mrs. Huo.

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,440
We can't judge

391
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,870
based on her words alone.

392
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,390
We still need to find a way

393
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,320
to meet Mrs. Huo

394
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
ourselves.

395
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,680
This Miss Huo is hard to figure out.

396
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,510
You'd best not show up

397
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,870
in Huo Mansion again.

398
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
If it really was Mrs. Huo,

399
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,120
then General Huo's death

400
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,790
likely has nothing to do with Yesha.

401
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,910
The fact that General Huo died

402
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,650
just as we arrived to investigate

403
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,870
might really be a coincidence.

404
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,790
Either way,

405
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,380
let's get to the bottom of it first.

406
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,720
General Huo's death

407
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,660
was caused by long-term use

408
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,120
of hallucinogenic drugs.

409
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
So the suspect

410
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,690
must be someone in Huo Mansion.

411
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,560
But there's one thing

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,870
I don't understand.

413
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,020
It seems to have no connection

414
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,410
to Yesha, Xiao Beiming.

415
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,510
Exactly.

416
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,870
Maybe there never was a connection.

417
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,840
Yun,

418
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,790
we made a solemn pledge

419
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,270
to His Majesty.

420
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,510
We can't afford to be stubborn

421
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,270
and waste time.

422
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,880
But I feel like

423
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,270
Xiao Beiming is right beside us.

424
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,710
Do you have any evidence?

425
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,310
Not yet.

426
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,589
But Father,

427
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,240
please give me a few more days.

428
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,680
Maybe

429
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,880
by solving General Huo's case,

430
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,079
we can uncover its connection to Yesha.

431
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,440
But if we can't catch Xiao Beiming,

432
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,750
even if we solve

433
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,720
100 cases,

434
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
it won't help.

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,109
If His Majesty blames us,

436
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,370
neither of us can bear the consequences.

437
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,590
But right now,

438
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,930
there are no other leads.

439
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,310
Let's take a gamble.

440
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,680
Why hasn't anyone returned yet?

441
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,760
Could anything have gone wrong?

442
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,240
Look.

443
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,270
The Huo family is still in mourning.

444
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,270
Why is Xue Qianshan

445
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,270
out at this time?

446
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,960
Let's go check.

447
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,830
I'll go with you.

448
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,630
Coroner Feng,

449
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
you go back and check the medicines.

450
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Don't follow too closely.

451
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,080
It'll raise suspicion.

452
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,550
That guy's sneaky—

453
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,310
clearly up to no good.

454
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,510
Let's go.

455
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,200
This place is hidden away,

456
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,310
with high walls

457
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,930
and guards at the entrance.

458
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,620
Something's definitely off.

459
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,350
From my past experience

460
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,410
investigating cases in the capital,

461
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,350
this could very well

462
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,880
be an illegal gambling den.

463
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,440
An illegal gambling den?

464
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,000
Unlike the official
gambling houses outside,

465
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,770
which are

466
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,960
regulated

467
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,960

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,640
these illegal gambling den

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,880
operate without oversight

471
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,960
and with much higher stakes.

472
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,350
Seems like Xue Qianshan
not only likes to gamble,

473
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,160
but he also plays for big stakes.

474
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,680
That's strange then—

475
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,070
how could he afford to go to such a place

476
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,590
with his salary

477
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,880
as a disciple?

478
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,490
Where does he get the money?

479
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,810
Someone's coming.

480
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,110
Give it back.

481
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,510
Okay.

482
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
Bring another 500 taels of silver,

483
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
and I'll return it to you.

484
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
That voice sounds familiar.

485
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,440
You're just returning it to me.

486
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,300
Why do you want another 500 taels?

487
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,270
What's the problem?

488
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,550
-The entire Huo family fortune
-It's him.

489

is in your hands.

490

Keep an eye on Xue Qianshan,

and I'll follow that guy.

495

Let's meet at Dingfeng Pavilion.

496

What are you doing here?

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,700
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

On my way to Huo Mansion,

503
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
I ran into Xue Qianshan.

504
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,930
He refused visitors today,

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,860
so I wanted to see what he was up to.

506
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,270
I see.

507
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,270
Wait.

508
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,070
You went to Huo Mansion alone

without telling me?

510
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
Are you trying to act alone again?

Didn't you have a stomach ache?

512
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,790
No, wait.

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,750
You wanted to go to Huo Mansion too,
right?

No.

572
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,030
Constable Zhong.

573
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't you feel like

574
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,550
you've changed

575
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,030
recently?

576
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,030
What?

577
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,590
You're not as cynical as before,

578
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,670
your brow isn't as furrowed,

579
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
and especially, the murderous look

580
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,550
in your eyes is gone.

581
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,920
But your sharp, sarcastic way

582
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,790
of teasing me

583
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,640
is just like it was three years ago.

584
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,880
Such a short time,

585
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,270
yet such a big change.

586
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,590
Constable Zhong,

587
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,000
Could it be that you've encountered

588
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,330
something… or someone…

589
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,240
who makes you happy?

590
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,930
I've always been like this.

591
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,750
It's just that
we haven't communicated much,

592
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,280
so you don't really know me.

593
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,110
Is that so?

594
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
I don't want to chat.

595
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm heading to Huo Mansion now.

596
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,380
Come if you want, or don't.

597
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,750
Constable Zhong?

598
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,830
Mr. Zhuge?

599
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,920
What brings you here so late?

600
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,000
Miss Huo,

601
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,200
we've discovered a crucial lead

602
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,640
in General Huo's case.

603
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,510
Time is of the essence,

604
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,000
so we had no choice
but to visit you this late.

605
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
I apologize

606
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,310
for disturbing you.

607
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,440
What discovery could possibly be so urgent

608
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,240
that you had to come at this hour?

609
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,760
Miss Huo, do you recognize this?

610
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,070
It's Beauty Snow.

611
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,030
Is this Beauty Snow

612
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,920
something you

613
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,310
usually use?

614
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,320
Yes, I do use it.

615
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,310
You didn't buy it.

616
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,570
Someone gave it to you.

617
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,550
Do I need someone else

618
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,000
to give me cosmetics?

619
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,730
I checked with the steward

620
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,340
and reviewed your monthly allowance.

621
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,400
It turns out the Huo family
has very strict standards

622
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,070
for food, clothing, and daily expenses,

623
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,200
especially for you.

624
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,640
With your allowance,

625
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,400
I doubt you could afford

626
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,240
such an expensive cosmetic.

627
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,960
Even if this Beauty Snow

628
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
was a gift,

629
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,830
so what?

630
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,960
Today, we noticed

631
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,750
Xue Qianshan acting suspiciously.

632
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,000
We followed him and found that

633
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,550
he bought this Beauty Snow.

634
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,350
It's a rare luxury—

635
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,780
only a few jars are available

636
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,240
in the capital each month.

637
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,920
Unless we're mistaken,

638
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,920
this one

639
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,810
was gifted to you by Xue Qianshan.

640
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,220
What exactly is the relationship

641
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,640
between you two?

642
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,720
This Xishi Snow

643
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,640
was indeed given to me by Xue Qianshan.

644
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,270
But there's nothing

645
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,550
between us.

646
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,780
It's completely impossible

647
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,000
for me to have any relationship with him.

648
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,440
He's been pestering me.

649
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,350
I accepted it

650
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,190
only because

651
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,750
I didn't want to make things ugly
between us.

652
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,750
Is that a problem?

653
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,880
Not at all.

654
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,440
Since Xue Qianshan

655
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,790
has feelings for you,

656
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
would you

657
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,400
be willing to help us?

658
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,640
Help you?

659
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,350
With what?

660
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,110
Beiming.

661
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,160
Thank you.

662
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,400
It's getting windy tonight.

663
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,730
Let me close the window.

664
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,030
I need some fresh air.

665
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,370
I'll be with you.

666
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,960
This swill cart is so heavy.

667
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
How am I supposed to push it by myself?

668
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,830
But you can't just

669
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,070
leave it in the middle of the road.

670
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,270
It's pitch dark out here.

671
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,350
If someone runs into it

672
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,400
and gets splashed with filth,

673
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,510
-it'll be a real mess.
-Alright, alright.

674
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,640
Officers, since you think

675
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,070
the cart's in the way,

676
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,750
then do me a favor

677
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,990
and help move it.

678
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,450
Don't worry,

679
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,110
I won't ask for your help for nothing.

680
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,920
I'll pay you.

681
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,200
You...

682
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,590
What do you mean?

683
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,590
The Elite Constabulary Unit

684
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,450
isn't what it was three years ago.

685
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,160
You should take whatever extra money
you can get.

686
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,270
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

687
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,440
You're pushing it!

688
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,240
Tong Shuang.

689
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
If—

690
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,030
I mean if—

691
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,590
if your mistake

692
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,160
caused people close to you

693
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,270
to suffer,

694
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,200
what would you think? What would you do?

695
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,240
You're

696
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,070
the only one I have left.

697
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,520
We're

698
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,000
thick as thieves.

699
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,880
If I make a mistake

700
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,350
and drag you down with me,

701
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,670
you wouldn't blame me, right?

702
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,880
Of course not.

703
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,480
I...

704
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,680
I mean what if it was someone else?

705
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,830
A stranger, even?

706
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,760
If it's someone else,

707
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,790
then of course you should make it right.

708
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,590
Make it right?

709
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,860
Think about it.

710
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
If your house caught fire

711
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:23,800
and accidentally

712
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,070
burned down someone else's house,

713
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,680
you can't just

714
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,240
stand there and watch them

715
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,440
sleep on the street, right?

716
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,000
You'd have to do whatever it takes

717
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,330
to rebuild their house.

718
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,030
Senior, are we really going to move this?

719
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,830
Hurry up.

720
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,510
Don't cause trouble for the neighbors.

721
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Thank you for your trouble, officers.

722
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,070
Thank you.

723
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,400
Beiming,

724
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
did I say something wrong again?

725
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,200
No.

726
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,370
You said it perfectly.

727
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,440
Thank you.

728
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,370
[Huo Mansion]

729
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,510
Dairong?

730
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,080
What brings you here?

731
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,070
I was restless

732
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,510
and just wandering around.

733
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,350
I didn't expect

734
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,790
to end up here.

735
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,640
Seems like you're

736
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,720
facing some trouble.

737
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,240
Tell me about it.

738
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,230
I'll help you sort it out.

739
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,620
My father passed suddenly

740
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,780
without arranging a marriage for me.

741
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,200
As you know,

742
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,400
Mrs. Huo

743
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,050
has never accepted me

744
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,400
or my mother.

745
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Now,

746
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
my mother and I

747
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,590
don't know who we can rely on.

748
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,440
Those tears come so easily.

749
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,960
This Miss Huo is quite something.

750
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,750
Dairong, don't worry.

751
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,070
As long as I'm here,

752
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,550
I won't let you suffer any injustice.

753
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,240
Thank you for your kindness.

754
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,640
However,

755
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,650
women's

756
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,160
daily expenses

757
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,510
have always been high.

758
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,920
I know

759
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,510
your monthly salary.

760
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,240
I'm afraid

761
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
supporting my mother and me

762
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,690
would be difficult for you.

763
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,480
How could I

764
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,400
burden you like that?

765
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
You're overthinking it.

766
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,350
I've been lucky lately

767
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,750
and found a way to make money.

768
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,970
I even earned a good amount today—

769
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,160
this much.

770
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,240
50 taels?

771
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,720
500 taels.

772
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,510
There will be more income in the future.

773
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,240
How do you make money?

774
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm afraid money earned by luck

775
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,330
isn't reliable.

776
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,160
I have a treasure.

777
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,000
Using it to make money

778
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,640
couldn't be more secure.

779
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,510
A treasure?

780
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,120
What treasure could be worth so much?

781
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,640
The treasure itself isn't valuable,

782
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,080
but it can bring me

783
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,180
a lot of money.

784
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,790
Dairong,

785
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,640
as long as you're willing to be with me,

786
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,000
I promise you'll live

787
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
a life of glory from now on.

788
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,550
Really?

789
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,370
I don't believe it.

790
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,240
Are you deceiving me?

791
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,840
Dairong, you don't trust me?

792
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,890
I'll go get the treasure

793
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,540
right now

794
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,830
and show it to you.

795
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,080
Wait for me, Dairong.

796
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,660
He didn't tell you what the treasure was?

797
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,400
Where did he go to get it?

798
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
He's been gone so long.

799
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,750
Murder! Murder!

800
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,380
Coroner Feng?

801
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Why are you here?

802
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,160
What exactly

803
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,350
happened just now?

804
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,750
What's going on?

805
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,640
Snap out of it!

806
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,790
Why do you have a knife in your hand?

807
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,440
A knife?

808
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,110
He's dead.

809
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,710
How did Xue Qianshan die?

810
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,550
I didn't kill him.

811
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know.

812
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,110
I didn't kill anyone.

813
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,550
I didn't kill anyone.

814
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,050
Stop him!

815
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,050
I didn't kill him!

816
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,030
Take the murderer away!

817
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,750
Wait!

818
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,070
The matter hasn't been investigated yet.

819
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,360
What else is there to investigate?

820
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,960
Do you want to see the entire Huo family

821
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
wiped out before you're satisfied?

822
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Mrs. Huo,

823
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,820
we're the last ones

824
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,920
who want to see another murder
in Huo Mansion.

825
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,360
I know Coroner Feng.

826
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,710
He wouldn't even

827
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,710
kill a chicken.

828
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,760
How could he possibly kill a person?

829
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,110
There's something off about it.

830
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,800
Give me some time
to investigate thoroughly.

831
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,000
Don't arrest the wrong person.

832
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Are you

833
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,760
trying to cover for him?

834
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,960
Of course not,

835
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,800
but we also won't convict anyone
without solid evidence.

836
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,590
There are still

837
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,670
many suspicious points

838
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,480
in this case.

839
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,440
The knife was in his hand.

840
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
The victim died at his feet.

841
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,280
What more is there to doubt?

842
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,679
Do you investigate cases

843
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,280
by just talking?

844
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,550
Mr. Zhuge,

845
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,530
words alone aren't proof.

846
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,570
Actually, it's not complicated.

847
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,230
There were no signs

848
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,630
of a struggle at the scene.

849
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,710
And Xue Qianshan

850
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,110
was stabbed in the chest,

851
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,360
which means he was facing the killer

852
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,030
when it happened.

853
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,070
Xue Qianshan was highly skilled
in martial arts.

854
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,070
For the killer to take him down
with a single blow,

855
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,800
they must

856
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
have either been

857
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
a master themselves

858
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,510
or...

859
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,510
Or someone

860
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,840
he knew

861
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
well enough

862
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,840
to catch him

863
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,800
off guard.

864
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,980
Coroner Feng and Xue Qianshan

865
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,860
weren't close.

866
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,800
Do you think

867
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,480
he would ambush him?

868
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,440
Maybe

869
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,230
he's a martial arts master.

870
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,550
What kind of master

871
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,920
sits dumbfounded on the ground

872
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,070
after killing someone,

873
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:33,730
letting you

874
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,360
catch him so easily?

875
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,960
Shut up.

876
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,050
You have no right to speak here.

877
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,880
Miss Huo is right.

878
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,280
Most importantly,

879
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Coroner Feng has no reason

880
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,400
to kill Xue Qianshan.

881
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,320
Who knows?

882
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,320
Anyway,

883
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,730
we can't just let him go.

884
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,320
Coroner Feng

885
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,550
is a member
of our Elite Constabulary Unit.

886
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,810
Even if he is a suspect,

887
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,670
he must be handed over

888
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,400
to the Elite Constabulary Unit
for proper handling.

889
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,670
He's unconscious now.

890
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,320
Please allow me

891
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
to take him back.

892
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,920
But you're all in this together.

893
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,800
Mrs. Huo,

894
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,770
please don't make baseless accusations.

895
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,910
I'll say it one last time.

896
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
Hand him over.

897
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,710
Senior Li,

898
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,550
let me remind you:

899
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,190
The case isn't solved yet.

900
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,360
Using torture without authorization
is a serious crime.

901
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,690
The Huo family has already had

902
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,630
enough trouble lately.

903
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,150
You...

904
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,530
Take him away.

905
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,670
Thank you.

906
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,990
We'll take Coroner Feng back

907
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,230
for questioning

908
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
and give the Huo family an answer.

909
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,930
But until the matter is cleared up,

910
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,960
I ask that no one

911
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,280
leave Huo Mansion.

912
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,670
As for the body,

913
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,530
the Secret Investigation Unit
will keep it for now.

914
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,240
Thank you, Miss Huo,

915
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,360
for speaking up just now.

916
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,160
It's nothing.

917
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,110
I never expected

918
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,880
something like this would happen.

919
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,710
What do you plan to do with him?

920
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,800
We'll interrogate him
according to the law.

921
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,550
Don't worry.

922
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,310
We'll get to the bottom of it.

923
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,880
Thank you then.

924
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,360
I'll head back now.

925
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,550
Take Coroner Feng back with you.

926
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,210
I'll go back and find someone
to handle the body.

927
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,110
You're not staying to question him?

928
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,210
This case isn't complicated.

929
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,480
There's nothing much to question.

930
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,960
Besides, didn't you say it yourself?

931
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,440
The killer is either a martial arts master

932
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,500
or someone familiar to Xue Qianshan.

933
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,960
Questioning him won't help.

934
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,560
Did you discover something?

935
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,110
Coroner Feng ruined this day.

936
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,280
I'm tired.

937
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,650
I'm going back to rest.

938
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,150
But you...

939
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,710
Don't worry.

940
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,480
I'll come back

941
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,590
first thing tomorrow morning.
