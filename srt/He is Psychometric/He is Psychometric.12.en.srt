Uh, more than that,

It was in Yeonhae-dong, Gangnyeong, Gangwon-do, in 1996,

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,560
and even though the fingerprints of the culprit was found,

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
it seems that they couldn't identify him either at the time,

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,840
so it turned into a cold case.

It's a case in which the culprit locked up a woman

Hey, Kang Sung-mo.

45
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,600
Why do you have so many secrets?

46
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
You've been thinking and worrying all by yourself for two years.

47

I'm telling you, I will help you.

48
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,880
Am I that unhelpful to you?

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
What a disadvantageous relationship we have.

50
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,560
I clearly show my thoughts,

51
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
and you show nothing, unless you say it.

52
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,680
Should I just step outside?

53
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,560
I think I'll only be in the way of you reading memories.

54

Okay.

69
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,160
You assume that these confinement cases only happen overseas.

70
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Most people don't know, but there's a lot in our country too.

71
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,080
Like the slavery case in Sinan,

72
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,520
or the case of confinement and assault by a pseudo-religion.

73
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,040
If it was a confinement case of this magnitude, it would've

74
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
attracted a lot of attention but I've never heard of it.

75
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,120
How could it not attract attention even after it became a cold case?

76
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
Because it became a cold case, it was swept under the rug.

77
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
What?

78
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
Please say something. Anything is fine.

A woman was locked up for nine years and had a child,

but the police never knew about it.

82
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
The victims escaped on their own,

83
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,200
without the help of the police.

84
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,840
The police were about to be criticized to death for

85
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,040
not being able to find the culprit, or even a shadow no less.

86

And do you know what the worst problem was?

87
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,680
That this culprit was undocumented.

88
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,480
So, this was a case that could've brought to light every one of

89
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,040
the police's weaknesses,

90
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,720
so they covered it up as quietly as possible?

This is the name Kang Eun-joo, the victim, remembered

97
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,720
but since he's undocumented, the name was useless as well.

98

By the way, what is this?

99
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,560
A long scar around his neck?

100

The culprit allegedly had an old scar around his neck,

but we don't know from what.

102

Since Kang Eun-joo and her son were the only ones who saw it.

103

Uh, if so, by any chance,

104

is there any evidence from that time still archived?

Her son became a prosecutor.

109

I handed the evidence to that prosecutor.

110

I beg you.

113
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,520
Why would he need that here?

114
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,120
The child does not smile.

115
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,720
Even with his ankle chained up, he doesn't say it hurts.

116

He doesn't want anything,

117

It is assumed that it was hereditary and

inherited from Kang Geun-taek.

136

Prosecutor Kang isn't very good at expressing his emotions,

137

alexithymia occurs

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,840
when the amygdala is naturally small.

151
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Amygdala?

152

All people have different personalities

153
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,840
due to the influence of the amygdala.

But this amygdala

(Korean Dictionary)

159
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
Then, in Kang Geun-taek's case, it must be

160
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
the circumstances in which he met Kang Eun-joo.

161
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
She's the one who made him, someone without emotions,

162
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,320
fall in love for the first time.

163
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,280
Perhaps that's why he's even more obsessed with her.

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Flowers.

167
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,960
Butterflies.

168
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
The sea.

169
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,360
The sky.

170
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
There are so many beautiful things out there.

171
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,160
Sung-mo, do you want to see them?

172
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,320
How do you like it? Isn't it pretty?

173
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,720
Go ahead and touch it.

174
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,480
Sung-mo, look over there.

175
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,880
I don't know what it means to "want to see them."

176
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
Or what "beautiful" is.

177
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,280
Does that mean Sung-mo was also under certain circumstances

178
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,120
where he started to feel emotions?

179
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm sure Prosecutor Kang

180
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
kept trying hard, so he wouldn't become

181
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,040
a monster like Kang Geun-taek.

182
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,520
Ahn told me that he saw Prosecutor Kang

183
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,040
learning about emotions from his mother

184
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,960
through psychometry.

185
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,800
Dr. Hong.

186
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,160
Is someone with alexithymia

187
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,640
same as a psychopath?

188
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,680
I see why you would think that,

189
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,680
but alexithymia and psychopathy have different brain structures.

190
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,000
Psychopaths have no empathy at all,

191
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,880
no matter how much you teach them,

192
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,000
but people with alexithymia can change if they try hard.

193
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
Though they might not be perfect.

194
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,720
Thank you, Dr. Hong. I'll call you again.

195
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,320
Are you okay?

196
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,520
I always wondered why Kang Sung-mo

197
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,880
never asked me for help

198
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,840
during this whole time.

199
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,000
But now I know.

200
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
They risked everything to break the chains,

201
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,440
to come out into the world,

202
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
but people were busy looking the other way,

203
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,880
ignoring their wounds, rather than helping them.

204
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,360
Did Sung-mo find the basement more horrible,

205
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,840
or this world more horrible?

206
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,600
What's the use of breaking the chains?

207
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,000
That incident is

208
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,040
still holding onto Sung-mo by his ankle.

209
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,880
My dad once said

210
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,360
that wounds fester if you neglect them.

211
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,920
We finally opened the wound that's been covered up,

212
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
so everything will be fine.

213
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Yeah.

214
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
A little more.

215
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,520
A little more.

216
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
"What does 'tame' mean?"

217
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
said the little prince.

218
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,200
"It is an act too often neglected," said the fox.

219
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,360
"It means to establish ties."

220
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,520
I want to stop reading it.

221
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,000
I want to hear more.

222
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,520
The very last part.

223
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,120
No?

224
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
You'll regret it.

225
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,800
Don't do it.

226
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
No.

227
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,080
Don't do it!

228
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,120
Don't do it, please!

229
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,080
Don't hit him, please.

230
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,920
You should've acted like this from the beginning.

231
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay, I'll read it.

232
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,640
But, I have a favor to ask of you, too.

233
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,040
What else do you need?

234
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,560
Clothes for the child, books, a flower pot??

235
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,480
You just need to answer my questions.

236
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,040
What is your real name?

237
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,120
Where are you from?

238
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,000
Kang Geun-taek.

239
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,400
That's my real name.

240
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,480
And??

241
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,280
I came from a place that exists, but does not exist.

242
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,640
What?

243
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,920
Now, as you've promised.

244
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,040
Read it.

245
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,640
"To me, you will be

246
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,480
unique in all the world."

247
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
"To you,

248
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,000
I shall be unique

249
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,760
in all the world . . ."

250
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,600
Yes.

251
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,560
I like

252
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
that very part.

253
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
Ahn.

254
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,320
Wake up, Ahn.

255
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,480
Lee Ahn.

256
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
Wake up, Ahn.

257
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Ahn.

258
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,080
Are you okay? Are you awake?

259
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,240
I told you to take it easy.

260
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,280
What if you die from doing this?

261
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Don't get angry,

262
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,040
and just give me a candy.

263
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,880
Eat it.

264
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,720
If Officer Yoon and I collapse we at least get workers' comp,

265
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,000
you don't, so eat up.

266
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Come on, Officer Yoon, make him eat.

267
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,120
What is this place that exists

268
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,000
but does not exist?

269
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,840
Was Prosecutor Kang able to find out the location of the culprit

270
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,240
with such a riddle-like clue?

271
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,680
An invisible man from a place that exists but does not exist.

272
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,920
Invisible man?

273
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,680
I told you earlier. He isn't even documented.

274
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
I saw it on the news too,

275
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,240
it said the invisible children whose births were never registered

276
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,400
have a high risk of being exposed to child abuse,

277
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,160
human trafficking and illegal adoption as they grow up.

278
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,400
I think there's a chance the culprit

279
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,040
had a similar childhood.

280
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,840
I think so, too.

281
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,120
Prosecutor Kang once won a commendation for catching

282
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,080
organ traffickers, human traffickers and panhandlers,

283
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
and some of the young victims who got rescued at the time

284
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,080
weren't registered??

285
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,520
Why did you stop speaking?

286
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,440
- I got it. - What?

287
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
All of Prosecutor Kang's cases,

288
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,280
I think it was a part of the process of finding that man.

289
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,240
If so, we need to look into the cases Prosecutor Kang worked on??

290
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,480
Hey, eat first. We need to go back quickly.

291
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
Eating isn't important right now.

292
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,040
If you don't eat it, I'll leave you here.

293
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,800
What do you mean, Ji-soo went to work at another station?

294
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,680
Ah, you see??A female officer was kidnapped

295
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
a few days ago.

296
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,040
It was a kidnapping and attempted murder,

297
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
but the culprit hasn't been caught yet.

298
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,480
The last time I saw her she said she was going

299
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
to investigate it herself and she left for Seoheun Police Station.

300
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
Wait.

301
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Did you just say, Seoheun Police Station?

302
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,960
Yes, sir.

303
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,040
Seoheun Police Station??

304
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,320
(Fire and murder case at Yeongseong Apartments)

305
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,040
Time to eat.

306
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,640
By the way, about that Detective Eun lady.

307
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,520
Just what kind of case is she working on? Huh?

308
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,960
What does she need with a girl that just got discharged?

309
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,120
Dakgalbi.

310
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,120
You were announcing that Jae-in is your "kid" and stuff,

311
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,960
and you don't even know where she took your "kid"?

312
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,600
Beans boiled in soy sauce, stir-fried kimchi.

313
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,440
If she ends up in the hospital again,

314
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,960
then I will tell her to quit this damn job.

315
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,080
Bean sprout soup.

316
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,000
My nose is faster than my eyes, even in this uneasy situation.

317
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Why?

318
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,160
By the way,

319
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,560
why are you here, Lieutenant Nam?

320
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
So I can eat.

321
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,160
No, I mean, you're more experienced than Jae-in

322
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,880
and you're a better fit for the job.

323
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,280
Why did she take Jae-in?

324
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
What about you, Lieutenant Nam?

325
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,080
What can I do, at my age?

326
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,960
Still, you're good enough.

327
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,080
Seeing you leading the investigation

328
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,040
when Jae-in was kidnapped,

329
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,840
you weren't completely lying about being a hotshot in your heyday.

330
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,640
"Being a hotshot in my heyday" means

331
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
that it's no longer the case.

332
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm no longer interested in trying to smash a rock with an egg.

333
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,680
(Invisible children)

334
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,120
Looks like he's knocked out.

335
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,160
When I was asked to train Ahn,

336
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,400
I got a notebook from Prosecutor Kang.

337
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,480
Ah, you mean the notebook about Ahn's psychometry?

338
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,520
Do you know about it?

339
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,080
Yes, I've seen it before.

340
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
The one Prosecutor Kang recorded every single thing in,

341
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
since Ahn first got his power.

342
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,080
So he gave it to you, huh?

343
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,360
There was an entry about finding a lost puppy stuffed animal

344
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,320
made by his mom, using psychometry.

345
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,520
(Ahn actively used his power)

346
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
It said that Ahn's power of psychometry

347
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,160
reaches its maximum potential when

348
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,920
something he desperately wants is involved.

349
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,880
So that's how Ahn was able to find you in lightning speed

350
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,520
when you were kidnapped.

351
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,080
Now we know what that bastard did to Prosecutor Kang,

352
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,800
I'm sure Ahn will read about

353
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,720
that bastard with all his might.

354
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,680
Let's improve his power a lot,

355
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,480
and use him as much as we can after this case is closed.

356
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
(Yeongseong Apartments)

357
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,440
(Fire and murder)

358
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,800
(Kang Geun-taek)

359
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,960
Now I can see everything at a glance.

360
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Yeongseong Apartments, Hanmin Nursing Hospital,

361
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
murder of Kim Gap-yong, and confinement at the steel factory

362
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
were all done by Kang Geun-taek, the one who kidnapped Jae-in?

363
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,680
Yes.

364
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,040
The motive behind all these murders was

365
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,360
Kang Eun-joo, Prosecutor Kang's mother.

366
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,080
Then what about the body of Kang Eun-joo found at Yeongseong?

367
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
I'm sure he murdered a woman who looked similar to Kang Eun-joo

368
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,520
beforehand and brought the body.

369
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,040
And since Kang Eun-joo's ID was with the body when it was found,

370
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,880
it seems that the arson was premeditated as well.

371
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,640
So he planned to have Kang Eun-joo be declared dead

372
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,320
and take her away, but he failed?

373
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,880
(Commissioner Eun Byung-ho)

374
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,560
Anyway, I'm sure only Kang Eun-joo and Kang Geun-taek know the truth.

375
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,280
- So, from now on, I will??- Wait.

376
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
That means you, Officer Yoon, knew that

377
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,040
your father was framed for sure.

378
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,760
Did you also know that Detective Eun Ji-soo's father

379
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,360
was in charge of that case, too?

380
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,040
Yes.

381
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,600
What a nasty twist of fate.

382
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
Detective Eun.

383
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,720
Let's speak privately.

384
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,720
Let's forget about our ranks, and talk as senior and junior.

385
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,400
Sure, go ahead.

386
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,800
You're going to investigate the Yeongseong case, even though

387
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,000
your father, Commissioner Eun Byung-ho, was in charge of it?

388
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,560
If the real culprit of the Yeongseong Apt. case is revealed,

389
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,000
my father will be held responsible for what happened,

390
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,480
but if all of the truth is revealed,

391
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm sure he will tell me that I did a great job.

392
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,080
Everyone makes at least one mistake in their life.

393
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,000
Mistake.

394
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
Mistake??

395
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,080
Let me be direct with you as well.

396
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,280
I know that you worked at the same station with my father

397
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,160
when Yeongseong Apartment case occurred.

398
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,840
Even though you weren't on the same team.

399
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,000
At what point did that investigation go south?

400
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,480
Was my father's investigation for covering up the truth on purpose,

401
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,160
instead of an overlooked mistake?

402
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,760
(Blind Spot of the Law: Invisible People)

403
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Lieutenant Nam acted weird, right?

404
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,200
Right.

405
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,120
It seems like he knew something about the Yeongseong Apt. case.

406
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,280
You said that after you became a junior cop,

407
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,800
you got caught looking into the Yeongseong case files

408
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,840
by Lieutenant Nam and he brought you here.

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,400
He even provided me with a place to stay,

410
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,320
so I thought he was taking pity on me,

411
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,080
but I guess not.

412
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,280
Was it because

413
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
he didn't want you to dig into this case?

414
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,840
Didn't you feel anything when you swept the human trafficking gang

415
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,960
involved with identity fraud?

416
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,480
I'm sure you've heard of the rumor about

417
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,120
that gang and YSS Construction being closely connected.

418
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,720
Yes.

419
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,920
But there wasn't a single mention of it in the papers or the news.

420
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Yes, it was because

421
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,400
It's not just the identity fraud gang, YSS Construction's influence

422
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,520
reaches the police, prosecution, politics and finances.

423
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,640
This is beyond your power, Detective Eun.

424
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,760
But what does that have to do with this case??

425
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,000
YSS Construction's former name before it got this big,

426
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
was Yeongseong Construction.

427
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,720
The layout of the Yeongseong Apartment buildings

428
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,960
made it difficult for fire trucks to enter,

429
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,320
which led to a large number of casualties,

430
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,200
but people were not interested in that. Why?

431
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,800
Because there was another more shocking headline.

432
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,080
- No??- "The hero that saved people

433
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,160
turned out to be the culprit behind it."

434
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,640
"It was all a part of his plan."

435
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,720
Can you think of a more scintillating headline?

436
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,840
So, did my father point to Yoon Tae-ha as the culprit

437
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,360
to cover up the corruption behind Yeongseong Apt.?

438
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,920
Ha??That's just crazy.

439
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
After that fire,

440
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,120
well, I'm sure you know it better than anyone,

441
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,080
but Eun Byung-ho started to rise up through the ranks quickly.

442
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,120
And he is now the Commissioner.

443
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,880
What do you think that means?

444
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,280
You have more than enough reason as a detective

445
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,240
to dig into the Yeongseong Apartments case

446
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,120
As Prosecutor Kang and his mother's case is connected.

447
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,440
But as Eun Byung-ho's daughter,

448
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
that case is a Pandora's Box.

449
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,680
In the end, Eun Byung-ho,

450
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,720
your father, will become the target.

451
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,720
Looks like Detective Eun is not coming.

452
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,320
She's not answering her phone, either.

453
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll take you home.

454
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,680
I live right there. You don't need to take me home.

455
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,640
But my mind is only at peace when you're right in front of me.

456
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,480
Ugh??I can't take you to my house, either??

457
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,600
Why should I go to your house??

458
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,240
Wait.

459
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,520
Those things piled up in Prosecutor Kang's room.

460
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,800
Weren't they all investigation materials?

461
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,160
Uh, I guess?

462
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,280
Let's go to your house right now.

463
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Have a seat.

464
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
We need to talk.

465
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,560
Do you plan to be this reckless and selfish much longer?

466
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,840
How can you just take any random case and walk out?

467
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,280
Society has rules and regulations.

468
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,040
Are you doing this because I got your back?

469
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,920
Come back to work tomorrow for real.

470
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,160
Detective Lee is going to be in charge of

471
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,240
the kidnapping of the officer at Seoheun Police Station.

472
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Dad.

473
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,720
Why did you do it?

474
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,760
Did you think that a castle built on sand

475
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,400
would last for a long time?

476
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
What are you talking about?

477
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,520
Do you want me to go everything

478
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,160
you've been hiding up until now?

479
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
I really don't know what you're talking about.

480
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,920
I know everything about the Yeongseong Apartments.

481
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,880
And everything about YSS Construction as well.

482
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,160
Eun Ji-soo.

483
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,200
Please let me officially re-investigate it now.

484
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,600
That's the best you can do.

485
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,120
It's all in the past.

486
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,840
No, it's still going on in the present.

487
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,080
Do you know how people are suffering because of what happened

488
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,040
and how they're living right now?

489
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
If you conducted a proper investigation at the time??

490
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,400
Even if I can go back to that day,

491
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
I will make the same choice.

492
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,040
How can you say that?

493
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,000
Because that was the only way to save you.

494
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,760
I was too poor and powerless as a father

495
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,040
to provide for you, who would collapse

496
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,000
a few times a year due to your heart.

497
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,160
I hated that, as much as death.

498
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,920
It was??because of me?

499
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
If you don't want to come to work, write a letter of resignation.

500
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,040
I can't sit by and let you do this any longer.

501
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,120
Oh.

502
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,920
Did Dae-bong feed you on time?

503
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,560
Weren't you scared, being home alone?

504
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,200
Should I take care of White Snow for a while?

505
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,000
My aunt is home, and you're busy.

506
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,560
White Snow will be lonely if she stays home alone.

507
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,000
- Really? - Let's go to my house, later.

508
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,000
(100-day plan to sweep crimes that threaten public welfare)

509
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,960
(Panhandling gangs)

510
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
- Is this the last one? - Yes.

511
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,720
By the way, is there a clue about that bastard in here?

512
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,240
If he brought these home,

513
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
then it means that he is concerned about these cases.

514
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm sure there's something in here.

515
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,840
I'll help you look.

516
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,280
- You? - More than anything,

517
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,880
I can read Hangul quite well.

518
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,040
Article 152, Paragraph 2 of Criminal Law.

519
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,680
The purpose of causing injury with malicious perjury is??

520
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,120
Ah, I need to go wash my face. I can't see straight.

521
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
I overdid it today, you know that, right?

522
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,800
- I know. - Not because I can't understand.

523
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,400
This isn't your field of expertise.

524
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,040
Don't try to take over someone else's job, too.

525
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,280
By the way, aren't you uncomfortable?

526
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,520
What?

527
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,360
Being with you alone?

528
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

529
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,880
I don't mix business with pleasure.

530
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,720
I have clear boundaries, you know.

531
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,240
I was talking about your clothes.

532
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Ah??

533
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,200
It does seem uncomfortable to work in, all night long.

534
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,880
Then, could you give me some clothes to change into?

535
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,040
What is this?

536
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,840
This silence, like the one right before the storm.

537
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,160
This feeling, like I will soon have a group of customers

538
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,640
storming in, even though I didn't prepare anything.

539
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,840
Mr. Hong, this place wouldn't be here without the alumni.

540
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,960
Why? I love the chicken here.

541
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,920
Don't compliment him.

542
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680
It'll spoil him. And you,

543
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,760
hurry up and eat that chicken so you can take over at the station.

544
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,080
Aren't you going back to the gas station, sir?

545
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
He's not going.

546
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
It's time for So-hyun to pick up the chicken she ordered.

547
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,520
But doesn't she have a baby?

548
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,000
Woah, sir.

549
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,080
Are you hitting on a married woman?

550
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,000
Nothing's wrong with dating her,

551
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,760
both legally and morally, but??

552
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,880
Hey, Dae-bong.

553
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,160
Keep following her around if you can be responsible until the end,

554
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,040
and if not, just end it here, you jerk.

555
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,800
Are you sure you can convince your father about So-hyun? Huh?

556
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,320
Hey, this won't end after a few hits from a golf club.

557
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Stop it, please.

558
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,720
Are you just planning to casually date her for a bit? Huh?

559
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,360
You little??So-hyun is already suffering enough, you jerk.

560
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,000
You're a morally corrupt bastard??

561
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,720
Let's go.

562
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Are you leaving?

563
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Mr. Hong.

564
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,640
I just wanted to make her smile.

565
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
Is that so wrong?

566
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,160
Goodbye.

567
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Come on, sir. Shoulders back.

568
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,240
I think you're quite attractive as well.

569
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,560
Uh??

570
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,480
You're cute, nice, and rich.

571
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
I'm sure I'm attractive as an easy boss.

572
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,000
Not as a man.

573
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
And what if she has a baby?

574
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,600
My dad is a stepdad, but he's so nice to me.

575
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,560
Stepdad?

576
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,800
Uh, I??

577
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,640
I'm not saying that I am trying to marry So-hyun??

578
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,920
Why not? You can, if you love her.

579
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:23,960
Huh? It's that car, right?

580
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,160
Don't turn around, and just go.

581
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,240
Hey, stop it. So-hyun will have a misunderstanding.

582
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,080
Ugh, I'm doing this so she will have a misunderstanding.

583
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,720
- What? - You don't know women.

584
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,880
There's nothing attractive about a man that's always there.

585
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,760
Hey, let go.

586
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,000
- Ugh, hurry up. - Hey, let go of me.

587
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,080
Ugh, if you go now, you'll regret it. Hurry.

588
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Hey, stop it.

589
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,280
Ah, then put your hand on my shoulder.

590
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,600
- Shoulder? No way??- Like this.

591
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,520
- Hey, stop saying nonsense. - It's okay.

592
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,640
Stop it, she'll have a misunderstanding. Stop it.

593
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,760
Come on, let's go.

594
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,720
- Let go. - Ugh, just go.

595
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,040
Stop it, I say. Stop it.

596
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,640
I don't want to hurt So-hyun's feelings

597
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,120
just to make her question her feelings for a bit.

598
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,160
Are you having a hard time because of me?

599
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,000
If you're sick of me following you around,

600
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
if you hate it and find it repulsive,

601
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
just tell me.

602
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,640
You'll never see me again.

603
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,960
Yes.

604
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I hate it so much it makes me sick.

605
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
Okay.

606
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
I got it.

607
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
(Invisible children, human trafficking)

608
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,640
Surprisingly, a lot of these materials are connected.

609
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,160
Human trafficking, panhandling gangs, organ trafficking.

610
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,040
There are especially a lot of murders of the homeless,

611
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,360
and these cases have a high chance of

612
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,000
unidentified or unregistered people being involved in them.

613
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,880
You've done so much, reading what you don't understand.

614
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,200
Sung-mo!

615
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,080
If you're going to stab and kill someone with that short height,

616
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,840
you shouldn't have stabbed here.

617
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,680
You should've stabbed here.

618
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,000
Ahn. Lee Ahn.

619
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Ahn.

620
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

621
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
A nightmare?

622
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,320
I felt like I did psychometry.

623
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,920
What kind of dream was it?

624
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,960
It was in that basement.

625
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,160
Sung-mo??

626
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,080
stabbed that bastard with a knife.

627
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,880
It's because you saw too many shocking things earlier.

628
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,080
Is that why?

629
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,080
Go to bed and get some sleep.

630
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,920
So you can use your skills again tomorrow.

631
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,400
What about you?

632
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,920
I'm going to go home soon, too.

633
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,520
I'll take you home. Let's go.

634
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,080
- Murder of the homeless? - Yeah.

635
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,040
That case bothers me the most.

636
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,960
On the day Kang Geun-taek kidnapped me,

637
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,440
I heard that the ID he had was fake.

638
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,200
And the real owner of the ID still hasn't been found yet.

639
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,080
So he killed the homeless

640
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,720
for their IDs?

641
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,120
I found some more cases besides those,

642
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,120
but I'll tell you about that after I look into them more,

643
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,440
By the way, there's something I just can't wrap my brain around,

644
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,200
- for a long time. - What is it?

645
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,920
Who is this person Kim Gap-yong mentioned?

646
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,320
Ms. Kang Hee-sook, you aren't dead yet.

647
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,800
I'm sorry, but that person doesn't want any more trouble.

648
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,640
I'm not sure, either.

649
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,680
But if we think of the worst case scenario??

650
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,960
Is it Sung-mo's??mother?

651
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,120
(Steel construction materials)

652
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
(Knife)

653
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,720
It bothers me that Kang Eun-joo attempted suicide on the day

654
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,720

to stop you,

658

then I must take that way.

659
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,760
Did that mean you were coming to meet me?

660

What if that bastard went to Ji-soo?

714

Hi, I'm Detective Lee Seung-yong.

I'll be investigating your kidnapping case, Officer Yoon.

What about Detective Eun?

717
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,080
Ah, she's not feeling well.

718
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,440
Ji-soo is?

719
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,960
Are you sure she's sick?

720
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,000
The Commissioner told me this morning, so I'm positive, I guess.

721
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,440
Anyway, the case has been handed to me.

Alright.

727
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,080
Could you please explain every single thing to me

728
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,120
in regards to what happened, from the moment you were kidnapped?

729
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,480
Every??single??thing??

730
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,600
Yes.

Oh, you didn't know.

732
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,920
It's time for her to go on patrol.

733
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,320
Right? Right?

734
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,080
Uh??Yes, right.

735
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,200
Uh??I'll call you later.

736
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,040
Goodbye.

737
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,080
Uh, Officer Yoon.

738
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,560
Officer Yoon?

739
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
Officer Yoon!

740
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,560
What the heck?

741
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,840
Where's Ji-soo, and why is that guy here?

742
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,560
Don't you think they lied about her being sick?

743
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,880
It seemed that Lieutenant Nam knows something about it.

744
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,040
It can't be helped. Let's go on our own.

745
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
To where?

746
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,000
(Sae Ki Dong Station)

(Authorized Personnel Only)

748
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,000
One of the cases Prosecutor Kang was in charge of was

749
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,040
arresting a panhandling gang as a part of the

750
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
100-day plan to sweep crimes that threaten public welfare.

751
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,160
Ah, the case that awarded Sung-mo with a commendation?

752
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,320
Yes. The assailants and victims of that case,

753
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,240
in other words, the panhandling kids and the gang members

754
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,640
testified about the place we've been looking for.

755
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,160
The Sae Ki Dong Station line?

756
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,760
That's no ordinary subway line.

757
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,360
There's a ghost station there.

758
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,520
A ghost station?

759
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,800
Explain it to me so I understand.

760
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,120
The platform we go to exists for sure.

761
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,160
But, have you ever imagined about what lies under it?

762
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,880
30 years ago, they tried to connect the route

763
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,080
on basement floor 3 in order to make a transfer subway,

764
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,440
but the plan was foundered,

765
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,680
so it resulted in a lot of unusable trains.

766
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,800
And out of those ghost stations, Sae Ki Dong Station was

767
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,280
often a hideout for the panhandling gang.

768
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,600
And that very panhandling gang

769
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,960
chained the children's necks to keep them.

770
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,880
(Sae Ki Dong Station)

771
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,080
You mean the chain mark on Kang Geun-taek's neck, right?

772
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,080
Yes. Kang Geun-taek avoided CCTVs

773
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,800
and moved through ghost stations,

774
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,080
so no one would see him for his entire life.

775
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,840
I think he learned how to move without being seen

776
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,880
when he was in the panhandling gang.

777
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,120
By the way, do you think Kang Geun-taek came back here?

778
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,360
It was where the panhandling gang was arrested,

779
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,920
so it makes no sense for him to be still hiding here.

780
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,640
We need to find the traces that cannot be seen.

781
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,960
That's your specialty.

How could you two just go there without a plan?

790
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,040
I'd like to apologize on my dad's behalf

791
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,960
about your father being framed.

792
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
I'm sorry.

793
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,600
I don't know if I'll be able to

794
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,760
pay off this debt by working hard,

795
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,000
but I won't make the same mistake.

796
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,560
Do you see anything?

797
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,120
No.

798
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,400

801
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
These are his.

804
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Damn it.

805
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,000
We just found the culprit's belongings

806
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,560
on the ghost platform of Sae Ki Dong Station.

807
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,040
We think Kang Geun-taek was here.

808
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,280
How could you two just go there without a plan?

809
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,280
No. I called you too late.

810
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,040
Officer Yoon, don't do anything dangerous, okay?

811
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,800
It'll take a while for me to get to Sae Ki Dong Station,

812
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,880
so I'll ask for a police backup.

813
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,440
Okay.

814
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,600
I'm sorry.

815
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,720
For getting there so late.

816
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,320
Please hurry, Detective Eun.

(Spy)

818
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,320
Yes, Detective Eun.

819
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,440
Send backup to Sae Ki Dong Station right now.

820
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,600
What? What's with Sae Ki Dong Station all of a sudden??

821
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,840
I just had a report about traces of Officer Yoon's kidnapper

822
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,960
hiding out there being found. Hurry.

823
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,880
I'm sorry, Detective Eun, but

824
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,800
the Commissioner told us not to provide you with anything

825
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,880
with any cases for a while.

826
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,520
- What? - I'm sorry.

827
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,880
Even if you call someone else, it won't be any use.

828
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,680
It's all in the past.

829
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,800
Nothing can change at this point.

830
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,080
No!

831
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,160
No??

832
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,600
Run! Run!

833
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,880
Run!

834
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,480
Is this the photo Kang Geun-taek took

835
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
from your house?

836
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,080
Yes.

837
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,520
I think it is.

838
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
(Gang, Guk)

839
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
What is this?

840
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,240
Why is Sung-mo??

841
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,120
Why? What did you see?

842
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,960
I once imagined what I would see

843
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,120
if I could do psychometry on myself.

844
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,800
The most painful memory in my past.

845
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,760
It's neither about the fire at the apartments,

846
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,920
nor the day Jae-in was kidnapped.

847
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360
It's about that day,

848
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,760
at the ghost station.

849
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,160
(He is Psychometric)

850
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,040
I want it to be complete

851
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,120
both on this side and that side,

852
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,720
without any flaws.

853
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,040
What do you mean, you saw him with Kang Eun-joo?

854
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,680
Sung-mo lured us to Sae Ki Dong Station.

855
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,840
He left the materials, so we can find that place.

856
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Sung-mo??

857
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,000
Was it you who told Ji-soo about Yeongseong Apartments?

858
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,240
Have you seen Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo

859
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,920
since the Yeongseong Apartment case?

860
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,480
I told her to go to where that bastard is.

861
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,680
So she can stop Sung-mo.
