(Dec. 3, 2005, 6:25 PM)

4
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,280
That person is here, Mom.

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,120
Did he find us?

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,160
Promise me that you will do as I say from now on.

7
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
You must do as I say.

8
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,040
Okay?

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
(He is Psychometric, Episode 6)

14
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,240
You know who did this, right? Prosecutor Kang.

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,960
That man has been stalking you.

16
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,480
He's been watching you for a long time.

17
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,160
He was watching you on the day we fell

18
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
from the apartments, too.

19
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
That person is here, Mom.

20
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,440
Perhaps it won't end until I die.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How are you?

22
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
I know that you're watching him,

23
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,080
but Sung-mo is doing fine.

24
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
From now on, I'll protect him.

25
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Ahn!

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
Wake up, Lee Ahn!

27
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,040
(Lee Ahn)

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
(Lee Ahn)

29
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,000
You jerk, why are you so late?

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,680
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

31
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,120
Let go of me, will you?

32
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Tripping and falling would look less embarrassing, you know.

33
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,520
I've practiced these skills for years,

34
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,720
so I can do lots of things without using my hands.

35
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, are you okay?

36
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,480
Dae-bong told me that you got stabbed by a knife.

37
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
This is nothing.

38
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
You know, I've experienced so many troubles in my life.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,440
This is why people say that the idiots are actually brave.

40
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm worried that I will be dumbed down to your level.

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,280
Dumbed??what?

42
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,040
I'm worried that I might get into a mess because of you.

43
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,000
I might become an idiot for training you.

44
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,600
So you decided to do it?

45
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah, I'm here to tell you that.

46
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Let's do it.

47
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,120
I look forward to working with you.

48
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,000
About my dad's case??

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,080
Can we try it when I have

50
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,600
improved you??enough?

51
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
Yes, let's do that.

52
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,120
We're ready for the meeting.

53
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Okay, let's go.

54
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,080
From now on, we will investigate the two Kang Hee-sooks.

55
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,160
The first one is the real Kang Hee-sook, who was murdered

56
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,200
four to five years ago and was abandoned at the stream,

57
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,520
and the second one is the fake Kang Hee-sook,

58
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
who posed as the real one and worked as a caretaker

59
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
at Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

60
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
If that caretaker posed as Kang Hee-sook,

61
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,800
then that mysterious woman must be the culprit.

62
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,120
If so, did she also kill Park Soo-young, the first victim?

63
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,080
We have to consider all possibilities.

64
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,840
I'll look into the fake one who worked at the nursing hospital.

65
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
The woman wearing a ring.

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A ring??

67
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,640
but I don't see any record of her wearing a ring.

68
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Who said that? Is there a witness?

69
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,320
Yes, there is. You don't need to know.

70
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,000
Then I'll look for the family of the murdered Kang Hee-sook.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,960
We need to know the time she went missing to find the suspect.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,040
Yes.

73
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Okay.

74
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,760
If we find new information, let's share it with each other.

75
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,160
I first need to go see Ahn.

76
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
Uh, sure??

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
- Go ahead. - I'll call you.

78
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,200
Did Prosecutor Kang just talk casually to you?

79
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Did it sound like that to you, too?

80
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,080
I'm not the only one who heard it that way, right?

81
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
What's with him? It scares me.

82
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Usually when someone talks casually to you,

83
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,440
that means he or she wants to be your friend, right?

84
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,280
Right?

85
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,720
But why, all the sudden?

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,600
People usually hate it when you suddenly drop honorifics.

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Are you actually happy about this?

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's go, we need to start investigating, too??

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We need to go.

90
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Hey, wait.

91
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
What about the thing I told you to look into?

92
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
When you leave the hospital, come to the station.

93
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Until then, I'll think about how to train you.

94
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Yoon Jae-in.

95
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,440
If you're going to thank me, then don't.

96
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me.

97
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,960
It doesn't matter.

98
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
I'm doing it for you, too.

99
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,000
You jerk, why are you so late?

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

101
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,920
That Yoon Jae-in. Seriously.

102
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
(Delicious Porridge)

103
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm sure you have lots of questions for me,

104
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,000
but I'm not ready to answer them.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,880
Make sure you eat well.

106
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me.

107
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
It doesn't matter.

108
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm doing it for you, too.

109
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Thank goodness you made a positive decision.

110
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
Ahn told me that

111
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,080
human memories are like mixed up pills in one container.

112
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
So he can't tell if it's poison

113
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,440
or an antidote.

114
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm not sure if I have

115
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,760
poison or antidotes in my medicine container,

116
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,200
but I have to know, so I'll take time to do it.

117
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,640
Yes.

118
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,800
That's exactly what I want, too.

119
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
What?

120
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,120
By the way, who was this person who stabbed Ahn?

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
I heard that he's been stalking you for a long time.

122
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,200
I don't know who that person is, either.

123
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,160
But what I know is that I can't??

124
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
leave it all mixed-up anymore.

125
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,040
Detective Eun. Here it is.

126
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,360
(Seoheun Delivery Service)

127
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,000
Is this it?

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
And we got no photo of the suspect?

129
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,280
Yes, the CCTV at Prosecutor Kang's house and the road

130
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,960
showed the car only.

131
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,760
I called the delivery service company too,

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,040
but they said they don't know who took it.

133
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
We asked them for a list of the employees leaving at that time.

134
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,960
What about the place where Ahn was stabbed?

135
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,760
There was no CCTV there at all.

136
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,480
He was wearing a cap, so the witnesses couldn't see his face.

137
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,360
Did you check the CCTVs of the shops nearby?

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,000
What about the black boxes of other parked cars?

139
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Ah??I didn't think of that.

140
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
"Ah??You didn't think of that?"

141
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
Those are the basics, you know.

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,760
If those are the basics,

143
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
then I'm sure Prosecutor Kang looked into it already.

144
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
- Prosecutor Kang? - Yes.

145
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,320
I called to ask for evidence materials,

146
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,040
but Prosecutor Kang already made copies

147
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,280
of all of that.

148
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,680
So that means Prosecutor Kang saw the faces of possible suspects?

149
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
Yes. Basics.

150
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
We're here. You can get out of the car now.

151
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,160
Why are we here??

152
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,760
I have something to give you.

153
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,320
This is everything I recorded about Ahn's power until now.

154
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm sure it will be helpful.

155
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,000
(Sep. 10, 2008, Location: Church playground)

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,520
Did you write down everything from then until now?

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,280
From now on, you need to do this.

158
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,000
I have so many questions, but I'll ask only one of them.

159
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,840
Just how much do I have to improve his power of psychometry?

160
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Enough so he can help with investigations?

161
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,040
Enough so he can find out the culprit with his power?

162
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
Would that be good enough?

163
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
This mission will end

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
when Ahn is??

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,160
able to perform psychometry on me.

166
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,720
Yes, I will wait. I will.

167
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,240
Just don't run away again.

168
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,720
It's all gone cold. Totally cold.

169
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,720
(Closed on Sundays)

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,120
It's been so long.

171
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm sorry for being unable to come and see you.

172
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,400
Your aunt told me that you became a police officer.

173
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm so proud of you. My daughter.

174
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,280
You saw how I'm doing, so it's time for you to say sorry, right?

175
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Then I'll cry, again,

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,320
and suffer for a few days at home.

177
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,000
I didn't come here for a while, because I hate that.

178
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
I know.

179
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't have much time, so I'll get to the point.

180
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,360
I am going to do it.

181
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
I won't run away or avoid that incident anymore.

182
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,040
I will re-investigate everything from the beginning.

- Jae-in. - I thought about living

184
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,120
my own life, regardless of you,

185
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,320
but there are unresolved issues at my foundation.

186
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,800
No matter what I put on top of it, it's a wobbly mess.

187
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,880
Jae-in, don't waste your time.

188
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,120
Me wasting my time was enough.

189
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,920
You go and live your life.

190
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,840
What can you even do at this point?

191
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,200
I heard that you fail your parole review every time.

192
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,040
You're doing that on purpose.

193
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
That's not it.

194
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,080
You're thinking that it's better for you to stay here.

195
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Because you think you'll only hold me back if you get out.

196
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Are you planning to die in here?

197
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,920
Go.

198
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,760
Don't come here ever again.

199
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,960
I killed all those people

200
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,760
at the apartments.

Don't touch my curtain with your dirty hands, you jerk.

Can you now even see without touching? I'll go wash them, okay?

205

Ugh, hey, move.

Ugh. Damn it.

Ugh, you're so damn grumpy.

Your hospital bill has been paid already.

209

It's been paid already?

210
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,800
Yes.

211
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Was my "brother" here?

212
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
Oh, wow.

213

Is he your brother?

Ah, this reaction confirms that Sung-mo was here.

Wow, what a happy life you have.

216
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,160
He pays for everything and you drive my car.

How will you spend your parents' insurance payout?

That's not important right now.

Wow??Did you know he never came to see me here?

220
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,160
I never got to see my car, either.

221
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,400
If it's been paid, then let's go.

222
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,040
Yeah, you missed me, didn't you?

223
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, me too.

Did he bully you? Are you okay?

- It's okay. I'm here. - Hey.

A child who lost his parents came to the orphanage.

240

He said that he let go of his mom's hand at a theme park.

241
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,040
But Ahn performed psychometry on him

242
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
and found out the address.

243
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,320
But that child

244
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,520
was abandoned by his parents.

245
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
They didn't lose him. They abandoned him.

246
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,800
The police found his parents,

247
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,960
but they did not take the child back with them.

248
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,400
It seems that the truth he sees with his power

249
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
is still quite burdensome to him.

252
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,000
are all fake.

What??What is this?

280
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,200
What's in it?

Oh??

Wow, this is a disappointing first day.

290
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey, what did you expect from me?

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,880
Did you think that if I drink coffee, I'd see people picking

294
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,120
To where?

295
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,840
I thought about so many things,

296
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,960
but I came to only one conclusion.

297
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
What conclusion?

298
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,280
Have you heard of the 10,000 Hours Rule?

299
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,000
It means that the time you try hard to be an expert

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
in one area is 10,000 hours.

301
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,200
Those hours may be for loving someone.

302
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,480
So-hyun is dancing in front of children.

303
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,560
Or for working, for someone else.

304
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,120
Anyway, this theory says that you require 10,000 hours

305
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,600
to become an expert in that area.

306
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,160
10,000 hours??

307
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,640
Three hours a day equals 10 years, five hours equal five years,

308
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
and 10 hours equal 3 years.

309
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,640
Even if you theoretically thought about it for 24 hours straight,

310
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,720
it would take 416.666666667 days.

311
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Would saying 417 days make you look less smart?

312
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,160
How old were you when you got your power?

313
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,320
I was eight years old.

314
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,800
If you polished, tightened and oiled your power

315
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,120
for three hours a day for the past 13 years,

316
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,080
you would've become an expert by now.

317
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,000
You wasted a lot of time treating your power like a freak

318
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,880
and pushing it away from you.

319
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,000
Still, I had quite a bit of trials and errors.

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
Do you think I just wasted my time?

321
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,080
So,

322
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,120
considering all that time,

323
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,160
I think you need to study hard for at least three months.

324
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,120
Study?

325
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,880
So, what is this place?

326
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,200
They say studying is the easiest thing, but??

327
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,080
I'm not telling you to do differentiations and integrals.

328
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,760
Ugh, what are those?

329
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,520
Starting today, I'll assign 10 books to you per day.

330
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,480
You'll read all of them until I'm out of work, page by page,

331
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,800
and write about your opinions right here.

332
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,560
I don't expect book reports, so write at least one line, okay?

333
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,880
Weren't we supposed to

334
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,600
do "everything" for my psychometry?

335
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,120
This is the first "thing."

336
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
If you can't read them all, you can borrow them. So get ready.

337
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,040
Hey, I hate touching books read by other people.

338
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,280
And you're telling me to read them page by page?

339
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,080
I know that you hate it. That's why I'm telling you to do it.

340
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,920
I read lots of books about investigations, you know.

341
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,320
What, like "Case Closed" and "The Kindaichi Case Files?"

342
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,840
- You're keen. - Do you think those

343
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,160
locked-room murders would happen in Korea that often?

344
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,200
I read mystery novels, too??

345
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,840
Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe, and modern mystery novels.

346
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,880
And American, British, Japanese and Koreans dramas, like CSI.

347
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,800
If crime movies are elective courses,

348
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
(Understanding and Studying of Practical Investigations)

349
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,280
this is a required course.

350
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,280
Hey, you shouldn't approach this like that.

351
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,040
My power is extraordinary and this is too ordinary.

352
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,280
Yeah.

353
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,960
You're a psychometrist.

354
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,880
You touch people to read their dormant memories.

355
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
And you read memories from objects, too.

356
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
Yes, that's who I am.

357
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,360
That's why I came to the conclusion to make you study more.

358
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,640
The more you know, the more you see.

359
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,120
You don't know that much, so you can't see that much.

360
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,680
Are you telling me indirectly that I am ignorant?

361
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,720
No, I'm telling you directly.

362
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,000
The more you know, learn and realize,

363
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,040
the more you'll see the pain of others and understand them.

364
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,880
That sounds too textbook-like??

365
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,880
Did you think about what kind of person

366
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
that woman in the luggage could have been?

367
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,040
Or about her family?

368
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,760
Or about how she died like that and the fear she felt

369
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,680
before her death? Did you think about those things?

370
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,960
That body??

371
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,360
No, that person,

372
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,840
isn't a tool to make your power come out.

373
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,800
Uh??

374
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,360
(Kang Hee-sook)

375
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,720
What? Are you here again?

376
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,440
How persistent.

377
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,680
I thought finding her name would speed everything up,

378
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,040
but it isn't easy.

379
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,800
Did you find the fake Kang Hee-sook?

380
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,720
No.

381
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,560
Ah, but there was one person who remembers her

382
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,880
at the hospital.

383
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,400
We're working on the composite sketch right now.

384
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,640
And this case will be openly investigated from today on.

385
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,960
Yeah. Do whatever you can to find her family.

386
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,440
She's dead, but no one is looking for her.

387
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
Poor woman.

388
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
Why are you so sentimental today?

389
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
Don't worry.

390
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,520
I'll stay at your funeral for the whole three days, Dr. Hong.

391
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,640
Hey, age doesn't dictate one's death.

392
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,320
You might die before I do.

393
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,640
Why are you so obsessed with life? That's unpleasant.

394
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,560
Okay then, I'll die before you do.

395
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,320
I hope you live long.

396
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,880
But make sure to come to my funeral.

397
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,400
What about that kid?

398
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,440
You mean Ahn? He left the hospital today.

399
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,160
- Why do you ask? - Will being stabbed by a knife

400
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
affect his power or do anything else?

401
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,880
Why are you interested all the sudden?

402
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,560
You told me to make sure you won't see him ever again.

403
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,440
So what?

404
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,840
Well, I'm going home early today.

405
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,480
I'm taking rest of the day off and getting some rest.

406
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,040
Go get some rest.

407
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,120
Ah, I got no time to play with you, Dr. Hong.

408
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm super busy.

409
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
You're not the only one I can play with, Detective Eun.

410
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,120
I'm taking some time off, you dummy.

411
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,920
The autopsy room will be empty.

412
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,000
If you have to suddenly come to the autopsy room,

413
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
use this.

414
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,880
You know this, right? Make it "beep" and it "beep" opens.

415
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,160
Bye.

416
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,680
This is why I like Dr. Hong.

417
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,000
What's wrong with this?

418
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,960
It must be broken.

419
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,360
(Psychology of Psychology)

420
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,080
Why??Why is it in there?

421
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,120
How could a thief report the police first?

422
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,400
She got caught stealing a book last month,

423
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,480
so we let her go, thinking it was a mistake. But again??

424
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,040
I'm sure someone keeps putting the books in my bag.

425
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
Why is she always feeling victimized like that?

426
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,040
She's a habitual offender.

427
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,880
Ha, is she an attention seeker or a kleptomaniac?

428
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
Hey.

429
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,000
I really didn't do it.

430
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
Is this a big case?

431
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
Should I use my power like last time?

432
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,040
Well, sure.

433
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,720
Where were you sitting at?

434
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,920
Here.

435
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
And I put my bag here.

436
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,040
When did you leave your seat?

437
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
I leave my seat often.

438
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,800
I have to go eat, answer phone calls, and more.

439
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
Uh??

440
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,000
I saw the person who put the book

441
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,960
in this lady's bag.

442
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The culprit is

443
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,240
someone wearing red nail polish.

444
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,160
Excuse me, but please show me your fingernails.

445
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,440
Excuse me, but please show me your fingernails.

446
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,080
Nobody's wearing red nail polish.

447
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,400
That can't be.

448
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
I saw it for sure.

449
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,080
What if she ran away already?

450
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,920
I don't think so.

451
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,800
If someone really put the book

452
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,320
in your bag on purpose,

453
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,480
I'm sure she wants to see how this goes.

454
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,200
Watching his or her own crime.

455
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,640
That's a kind of criminal psychology.

456
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
When are you going to stop disturbing us?

457
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,160
Ugh, you're interrupting my studies.

458
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,560
So annoying.

459
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Uh, wait.

460
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,400
Isn't that a fingernail?

461
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
What?

462
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,120
Yikes, what is this? Oh.

463
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,000
Yikes. Damn it.

464
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Oh, no, I didn't do it.

465
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,040
Yes, you did.

466
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,240
You were carrying such clear evidence.

467
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,160
Damn it.

468
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,360
She dropped it?

469
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
She's not the culprit, right?

470
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
How did you know?

471
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,200
I have a firm belief about a certain suspect.

472
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Can I have a conversation with you for a moment, please?

473
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,160
- Me? - When you showed me your nails,

474
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,240
I saw that the tips of your nails were damaged.

475
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,440
Like wounds formed by tearing out artificial nails in a hurry.

476
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,000
Ah??You see, I have a habit of biting my fingernails.

477
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,920
You know that we can do a DNA test not only with blood and hair,

478
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,960
but also with fingernails, right?

479
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,840
Your nails were damaged while tearing them out.

480
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,560
Wow, you're bleeding, too.

481
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,000
Shall we proceed with the case, do a DNA test and call you?

482
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,160
Or would you apologize now politely and end it?

483
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,280
Hey, did you do it?

484
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,840
She's totally obsessive-compulsive.

485
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,160
She attaches notes when I breathe, saying it's noisy.

486
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,560
She glares at me for shaking my legs.

487
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,640
And she freaks out when I use a pen.

488
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm so sorry.

489
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,040
It seems like you're bringing the cases to us.

491
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,000
But the problem is that they're too petty.

492
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,760
Anyway, Officer lady, you're the best!

493
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,120
Thank you too, oppa.

494
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,720
Oh, come on.

495
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,120
Wow, what a nuisance she is.

496
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,400
I will never do that in the library.

497
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,040
(Focus!)

498
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,240
(You need to focus)

499
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
(Can't you stay awake?)

500
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,840
(Ji-soo)

501
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
Huh?

502
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,320
Hey, where are you?

503
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,120
At a library? With Officer Yoon?

504
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,280
Hey, do you think studying will help you with psychometry?

505
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,840
I don't know.

506
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,680
Anyway, I'm trapped by Officer Yoon due to

507
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,560
special order of Prosecutor Kang, so keep that in mind.

508
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,160
Hey, what's Prosecutor Kang plotting?

509
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,280
Who knows what he's thinking?

510
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,600
Hey, anyway, we need to meet. Meet me in a bit.

511
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,840
Later on? Where?

512
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
At the autopsy room.

513
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,600
I'm always available for the autopsy room.

514
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,040
Yeah, see you in a bit.

515
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,080
Okay.

516
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Yes!

517
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,200
(Aren't you going to study?)

518
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
"Aren't you going to study?"

519
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,280
(Aren't you going to study?)

520
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,160
I got it! I got it right!

521
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,560
Yes, I got it!

522
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,040
Okay, okay, I will.

523
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,240
I will study, okay?

524
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Officer Yoon is making Ahn study for psychometry?

525
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,080
Looks like there's something between Ahn and Officer Yoon.

526
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,040
No, would that make it between three people?

527
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,280
Including Prosecutor Kang?

528
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,560
(The abandoned luggage case now openly investigated)

529
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,480
What the heck? Why is he there?

530
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
I'm sure you remember the black luggage with a dead body in it,

531
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,320
which was found at a stream in Seoheun-dong, Seoul, last month.

532
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,040
Even though she has already been identified,

533
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,400
no relatives of her have been found, right?

534
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,160
No. This woman, presumed to have died four to five years ago,

535
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,800
has been identified as Kang Hee-sook, age 59.

536
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,640
But when she went missing is unclear,

537
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
and the investigation is experiencing a stormy passage.

538
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,840
Okay, could you please enlarge the photo

539
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,840
so the viewers can see it in details?

540
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,120
If you know anything about the deceased

541
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,720
Ms. Kang Hee-sook, age 59, or her family.

542
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,000
Any information

543
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,120
would greatly help with the investigation.

544
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Yes. By the way, we did our own investigation.

545
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,080
We found that the deceased Kang Hee-sook

546
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,080
was determined missing during the fire at Hanmin two years ago.

547
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
What is this about?

548
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,360
That wasn't a prescreened question.

549
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,160
We received a report that the Kang Hee-sook who went missing

550
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,000
after the fire isn't the Kang Hee-sook in the photo.

551
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,040
That means someone's living with the identity of

552
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,360
the deceased Kang Hee-sook.

553
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,040
Can you please explain it,

554
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,520
so the viewers can understand it?

555
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,400
That's something we cannot speak of at this moment.

556
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,360
If you know Ms. Kang Hee-sook, age 59,

557
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,560
who died four to five years ago, please call us.

558
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,440
(If you know Ms. Kang Hee-sook, age 59, please call us)

559
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,800
He shouldn't leave like that, right?

560
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
That's a broadcasting accident.

561
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,800
He shouldn't do that, but??

562
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,080
Wow, he's so charismatic.

563
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,560
Our Daddy-Long-Legs.

564
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,240
- Stop saying Daddy-Long-Legs. - Why not?

565
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,040
Why is he your Daddy-Long-Legs, ma'am?

566
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,000
He seems too young to be called that by you.

567
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,080
You calling me ma'am sounds

568
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,040
even weirder, Lieutenant Nam.

569
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,320
Then what should I call you?

570
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,600
Ms. Sook-ja? That's embarrassing.

571
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,280
When did this come out?

572
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Ugh!

573
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,040
Ugh, disgusting.

574
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Just call me Ms. Oh.

575
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,240
Everyone in this town calls me "Ms. Oh, the singing teacher."

576
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,360
Haven't you heard?

577
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,880
Ms. Oh, huh?

578
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,080
Sook-ja, you were at the station as a fraud victim and cried,

579
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,520
with your eyeliner smudged like a horror movie. My, you've grown.

580
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,280
What??What are you talking about in front of Officer Yoon?

581
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,600
What is this? Did you two know each other already?

582
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,280
Oh, of course not.

583
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,120
We just??saw each other on the street, passing by.

584
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Why are you here?

585
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Because it's time to go home.

586
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What is this?

587
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,480
"The title of the book."

588
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,520
"Understanding and Studying of Practical Investigations."

589
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
"My opinion."

590
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,880
"Why do they mix Chinese characters into the books?"

591
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,080
There are so many of them and I couldn't read it.

592
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,000
Ugh, damn it.

593
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,080
"The title of the book." "The Crime Scene."

594
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,120
"My opinion."

595
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,960
"The part about murders with guns was quite impressive."

596
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,920
"Do you think those a murder like that

597
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,600
will ever happen in Korea?"

598
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,160
"Featuring Yoon Jae-in?"

599
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,760
Murders with guns in Korea are

600
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,120
as rare as locked-room murders.

601
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,800
You little??

602
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Do you actually have any will to study?

603
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,560
I will show you the understanding and studying of

604
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,960
practical investigations at the crime scenes.

605
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,000
Follow me.

606
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
(NFS public servant ID /Hong Soo-yeon)

607
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,760
Door unlocked.

608
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,920
Welcome.

609
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,520
I thought about bringing Officer Yoon to this place as well.

610
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,880
Thank you.

611
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
Of course, we should come here together.

612
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,000
We're playing big parts in this case.

613
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Right?

614
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,440
Actually, my expectations for him aren't high.

615
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,080
Ahn has been here about 10 times,

616
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,160
- and he almost always failed. - Detective Eun?

617
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,360
Do you know what he saw with psychometry on his first try?

618
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,080
- Underwear sizes - Ji-soo!

619
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,400
Don't tell her.

620
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,800
But,

621
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,920
when in hindsight, that was a very important clue.

622
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,280
The underwear Ahn saw with psychometry

623
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,400
were for the women who died in the patient's room,

624
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,920
and that woman who posed as Kang Hee-sook brought those.

625
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,000
What??What do you mean?

626
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,720
That woman wearing a ring.

627
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,680
The woman you saw with psychometry two years ago.

628
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,960
The fake Kang Hee-sook.

629
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,960
The fake??Kang Hee-sook?

630
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,840
I saw it on the news.

631
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,200
That someone's living with the dead Kang Hee-sook's identity.

632
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,720
Yes.

633
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,640
That woman Ahn saw with psychometry

634
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,120
stole the name of this dead woman and was living with it.

635
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,360
It seems that Prosecutor Kang is taking his time to train you,

636
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,040
but I can't do that, so I need to see it now.

637
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,400
About why and who

638
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,040
killed this woman and lived her life.

639
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,560
Yeah, I have no idea about what you're talking about,

640
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,120
but I need to see it, right?

641
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Wait.

642
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,040
- I can't agree with you, either. - What?

643
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
Ahn might be able to find something out

644
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,080
by doing psychometry on her.

645
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,000
He might see the moment of her death,

646
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,720
or something from when she was still alive.

647
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,960
But I'm sure he will be confused.

648
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,320
- And might not understand. - So?

649
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,120
So what? Are you telling me to wait for 10,000 hours?

650
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,840
- No, I can't wait. - No, you have to wait.

651
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,440
Please show us the investigation files

652
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
compiled thus far.

653
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,720
- What? - I know that this is

654
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,800
a rare opportunity, for both me and Ahn.

655
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,880
So, if you can give me one hour,

656
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,520
I will make sure Ahn understands this case.

657
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,040
I'm sure he'll be able to see a lot more.

658
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,160
Don't worry. Trust me.

659
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,040
Alright, Officer Yoon. I know what you mean.

660
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,680
I'll go get the files, so wait here.

661
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,880
She's quite good. That Yoon Jae-in.

662
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,720
Hey, you??

663
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,200
Ah.

664
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,880
I didn't tremble in front of Detective Eun, right?

665
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,120
Was I okay?

666
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,480
Yeah, you were totally awesome, Yoon Jae-in.

667
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,680
So much for awesome.

668
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,720
I couldn't understand what Detective Eun said, either.

669
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,760
What?

670
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,480
We can't leave here just after touching a body one time.

671
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
This is a rare opportunity.

672
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,840
It may be my last chance to go to a criminal team.

673
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,000
I will use you and

674
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,160
find out all of the information about this case??

675
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,640
So that was it, huh?

676
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,200
You'll go to a criminal team as a reward for

677
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,560
- training me, huh? - Uh, you see??

678
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,120
If so, are there two tools you can use to go to

679
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,040
a criminal team in this place?

680
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,520
Bragging has become my habit,

681
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,840
so I blabbered without thinking.

682
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,080
Well, alright.

683
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,040
I can start thinking right now. It's not too late.

684
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,080
About who she is,

685
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,080
and why she had to be lying here.

686
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Let's do this.

687
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Together.

688
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,880
Ugh.

689
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,720
Why are you here?

690
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,000
I heard that the composite sketch for the fake Kang Hee-sook is out.

691
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Ah??

692
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,080
Why did they call you first, instead of me?

693
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,520
Ah, I saw you on TV.

694
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,800
Oh, you made an appearance in person.

695
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,280
You looked great on screen.

696
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,920
And storming out at the end was quite impressive, too.

697
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,480
It seems that the information leaked from somewhere.

698
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
Tell your team members to tighten up the security.

699
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,000
It wasn't leaked by us, the police.

700
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,760
I'm Eun Ji-soo, the meticulous. Don't you know?

701
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,360
The prosecution should tighten up their security.

702
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,480
By the way, why are you here at this hour?

703
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,000
I suddenly wanted to see Dr. Hong.

704
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,480
I heard Dr. Hong went home early.

705
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,560
Ah??

706
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,160
If so, can you explain where you are taking our files to?

707
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,880
Detective Eun Ji-soo, the meticulous?

708
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,680
Ah, you see??Uh??

709
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,000
Ahn and Officer Yoon are at the autopsy room right now.

710
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,880
I'm sure Ahn didn't ask you to show him the files.

711
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,120
Did Officer Yoon ask for them?

712
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,720
Yeah, she won't make Ahn do psychometry without information.

713
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,160
I knew it.

714
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,800
It's Officer Yoon, right?

715
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,840
What?

716
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,600
The one you want Ahn to do psychometry on.

717
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,040
- That's right. - Why?

718
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,680
Why is Officer Yoon the one?

719
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,160
What a disadvantageous relationship we have.

720
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,000
I clearly show my thoughts,

721
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
and you show nothing, unless you say it.

722
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,280
Officer Yoon Jae-in's father is

723
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,120
Yoon Tae-ha.

724
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,920
The culprit behind

725
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,560
the fire at Yeongseong Apartments.

726
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,960
I'll get the composite sketch and go to the autopsy room.

727
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,080
The direct cause of death must be hemorrhage in the occipital area.

728
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,960
You said you'll help me understand it.

729
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,880
It means that she died because she was hit on her head

730
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,400
and she bled a lot. Got it?

731
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,160
And the murderer put her into the luggage after killing her?

732
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,480
And then threw her into Han River.

733
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,040
Did you see the news with Prosecutor Kang as the guest?

734
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,120
This woman has been dead for four to five years,

735
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,520
but she has been found now, after all those years.

736
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,160
I'm sure she had something to say.

737
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Something to say?

738
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,960
The fact that I found the body that has been underwater for

739
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,560
such a long time means she has something to show me.

740
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,080
Yeah, make sure to see it and boast about it.

741
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,440
I should.

742
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,320
Boasting is habitual and quite contagious.

743
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,880
Ugh, why are you so late?

744
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,080
The time you wasted doesn't count.

745
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,040
That one hour starts right now, okay?

746
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
Okay.

747
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Officer Yoon Jae-in's father is Yoon Tae-ha.

748
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,840
The culprit behind the fire at Yeongseong Apartments.

749
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,160
(The abandoned luggage case with a dead body)

750
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,040
Kang Hee-sook. Here's the cause of death.

751
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,160
She did die from hemorrhage in the occipital area.

752
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,360
Hey, you were right.

753
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,560
So only her cause of death and identity are revealed, right?

754
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,480
Huh?

755
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,120
Yeah??

756
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,160
Can I see the files for the Hanmin Nursing Hospital fire, please?

757
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,040
The person posed as this woman worked at that hospital, right?

758
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,360
That's right. The woman wearing a ring. The one I saw.

759
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,840
Yeah.

760
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,080
Looks like the composite sketch of this woman is out.

761
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,000
Prosecutor Kang is bringing the materials here.

762
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,080
What? Sung-mo is?

763
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,440
Yeah, he knows that you guys are here at the autopsy room.

764
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,360
Will he??be angry by any chance?

765
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,680
For me coming here without any permission as well?

766
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,040
Don't worry about that.

767
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,080
I've never seen him smile

768
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,200
so sincerely like that before.

769
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,120
Her eyes were more gentle than these.

770
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,040
- Like these? - And she was skinnier than this.

771
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Ah, okay.

772
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,800
Uh??Yes, like that.

773
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,560
051203??

774
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,560
Found him.

775
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,760
(Composite sketch of Kang Hee-sook)

776
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,640
Here's the composite sketch of the fake Kang Hee-sook.

777
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,120
Hey, hey, he is the witness.

778
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,840
(Witness)

779
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,680
(Kim Gap-yong)

780
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,880
Ugh, why isn't he here yet?

781
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,360
Let's begin on our own.

782
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,360
Huh? Ms. Kang Hee-sook, you aren't dead yet.

783
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,720
I'm sorry, but that person doesn't want any more trouble.

784
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,560
She was lying on the ground, bleeding a lot from her head.

785
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,840
Don't hurry and take time to think.

786
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,040
What did you see?

787
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
A piece of black luggage.

788
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
A hammer.

789
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,240
And a man.

790
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
A man?

791
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,760
What man?

792
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,480
I've seen him somewhere.

793
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,760
It was him. I'm sure.

794
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,920
Kim Gap-yong?

795
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,120
Are you sure it was him?

796
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm sure. It was him.

797
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,080
He killed Kang Hee-sook.

798
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,120
He was the witness of the Hanmin Nursing Hospital fire, right?

799
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,760
But??A murder by sudden attack??

800
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,520
Did you say you were there at the Hanmin Nursing Hospital fire?

801
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,840
I am an insurance planner.

802
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,240
I'd like to hear the testimony about

803
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,680
the fire case for one last time.

804
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,480
I know it would be troublesome, but could you please come here?

805
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,280
I found you, Prosecutor Kang, on the call logs,

806
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,600
so I called you first.

807
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,520
It seems that he was attacked on his way to meet us.

808
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,920
I remember it clearly.

809
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,200
He was murdered right after getting Prosecutor Kang's call.

810
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,320
Why did he??

811
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,320
- Lee Ahn! - Ahn!

812
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,680
- Ahn! - Lee Ahn!

813
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,040
Ahn!

814
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,120
Lee Ahn, what's wrong? Wake up!

815
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,080
- Hey, Ahn! Ahn! - Lee Ahn!

816
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,480
- Ahn! - Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!

817
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,280
What's wrong with him? Ahn! Ahn!

818
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,400
- Ahn! Ahn! - Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!

819
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,000
Prosecutor Kang! Ahn collapsed!

820
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,080
I am going to do it.

821
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,520
I won't run away or avoid that incident anymore.

822
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,720
I will re-investigate everything from the beginning.

823
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,400
I thought about living my own life, regardless of you,

824
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,360
but there are unresolved issues at my foundation.

825
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,040
No matter what I put on top of it, it's a wobbly mess.

826
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,080
Ugh??you're being miserable, again.

827
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,480
Hey, go to sleep.

828
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,400
Ugh, the prison guards will be here soon.

829
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,640
They just did their last patrol around.

830
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,480
They won't come today.

831
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,040
Damn it, don't you get any sleep?

832
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,320
Damn it. Damn it.

833
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,200
Lee Ahn, are you okay?

834
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,400
Are you awake?

835
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,360
So you mean that man named Kim Gap-yong

836
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,560
killed the two women in the two pieces of luggage?

837
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,760
- With a hammer? - Yes.

838
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,120
But it sounded like someone was behind him.

839
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,480
"I'm sorry, but that person doesn't want any more trouble."

840
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,960
That person doesn't want any more trouble.

841
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,680
So that means someone incited the murder of the two women?

842
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,080
Ah, the composite sketch of the fake Kang Hee-sook.

843
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,160
Was she there, too?

844
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,200
No, that was all I saw.

845
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Is she the fake Kang Hee-sook?

846
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,600
Yes. Take a good look at her.

847
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,400
Is she the one you saw when you did psychometry for

848
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,760
- Hanmin Nursing Hospital? - But I didn't see her face.

849
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,000
Still, I'm asking you just in case.

850
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,320
Could she have incited the murder?

851
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,080
To get a new identity?

852
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,760
Anyway, Kim Gap-yong killed the real Kang Hee-sook

853
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,120
and made a fake Kang Hee-sook, huh?

854
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,520
If so, since Kim Gap-yong testified about the fire case,

855
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,000
his testimony now has a higher chance of being false.

856
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,280
Just who is this woman, anyway??

857
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,160
Then we must start over with Kim Gap-yong for the investigation.

858
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,560
Looks like we saw everything to see from the dead Kang Hee-sook,

859
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,840
and finding the missing Kang Hee-sook is at a standstill.

860
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,400
That's exactly what I was about to say.

861
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,000
Me, too.

862
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,120
I'm sorry. I crossed the line, right?

863
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,280
No, you didn't. You made the correct point.

864
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,000
Uh??sorry to ask you this at this serious moment, but

865
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,520
when you said finding the missing Kang Hee-sook is at a standstill,

866
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,120
does that mean we're standing still?

867
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,320
What?

868
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,240
He's the powerful one who saw the murder scene,

869
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,640
so shall we forgive his ignorance for that?

870
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,640
I'm sorry.

871
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,120
Why, why are you sorry, Officer Yoon?

872
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,600
I know, right?

873
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,400
After all, I decided to teach him.

874
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,120
In accordance with the 10,000 Hours Rule,

875
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,040
just wait for 416.666666667 days.

876
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,320
I will turn over a new loaf.

877
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,240
- Turn over a new leaf. - Turn over a new leaf.

878
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,760
You two have done so much today.

879
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,560
With results like these, we might not have to wait for

880
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,320
416.666666667 days, you know.

881
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,600
That's what I mean.

882
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,800
Ahn, and you, Officer Yoon??

883
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,160
Cheer up.

884
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,960
Yes, I will polish, tighten and oil him even more.

885
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,680
What am I, a machine?

886
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,120
I'll leave Ahn in your hands, Officer Yoon.

887
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
Let's go.

888
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Wait.

889
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
Aren't you going home? Don't you have anything to say?

890
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,400
Look at me, huh?

891
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,840
Not here. Look.

892
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,400
We haven't talked since this happened to me.

893
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,360
I'm sure you have lots of questions too,

894
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,040
but so does she.

895
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,600
Yeah, I'll take him today.

896
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,800
Move.

897
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,000
Wow, what kind of "brother" is he?

898
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,000
Hey, did you see? Wow??

899
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
Hey, you try hailing a taxi too.

900
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,480
Why did he kill them?

901
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,480
And why did he die?

902
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,560
- What? - He killed two women.

903
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,000
That man named Kim Gap-yong.

904
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,120
And then he was killed by someone.

905
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,560
About the fake Kang Hee-sook, you saw with psychometry

906
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,360
at the autopsy room for the first time.

907
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,720
The one wearing a ring.

908
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,680
Do you remember anything else about her?

909
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,600
It's been two years already.

910
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,760
It'd be weird if I actually remember something.

911
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,040
But I remember everything about you from two years ago.

912
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,480
What??do you mean??by that?

913
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,840
Because you were so peculiar.

914
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,000
Ah, ah??

915
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,760
Hi, Auntie.

916
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,720
Don't get shocked and listen to me.

917
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,360
Tae-ha??

918
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,160
No, your dad??

919
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,920
Taxi??

920
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Taxi!

921
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,640
Taxi!

922
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,680
What happened?

923
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,000
I have to go now.

924
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,680
Is it that thing again? Hyperventilation?

925
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,480
A bag, do you have a bag?

926
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
I don't.

927
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,200
Don't worry.

928
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,960
I won't touch you until you allow me to.

929
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,440
(He is Psychometric)

930
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,440
I killed all those people at the apartments.

931
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,360
Why are you saying such weak things?

932
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,760
You know who that person is, right?

933
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,560
It's even more miserable if you waste my life because of me.

934
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,040
I will find this person and kill him or her.

935
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,080
I think he's asking for help.

936
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,040
Will you come with Prosecutor Kang

937
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,240
and Detective Eun next time?

938
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,080
At this rate, if you know Kim Gap-yong, raise your hand.
