00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
She's just one of those women involved in identity theft.

168
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
Do you think I let you become a cop

169
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,080
so you can take care of such trivial cases?

170
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,160
Since you're on a career path, you need to play big.

171
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
Fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital and Yeongseong Apartments,

172
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,760
both are connected to the luggage murder case for sure.

173
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeongseong??Apartments?

174
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
Don't you have anything to say to me?

175
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,480
Say what?

176
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,120
You said that you investigated it completely and perfectly.

177
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,840
You said you did everything properly.

178
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,680
But why is Kang Sung-mo's testimony record missing?

179
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
(Fire and murder case at Yeongseong Apartments)

180
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,520
Kang Sung-mo said this during my first visit to the orphanage.

181
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,160
That we should re-investigate the fire at Yeongseong Apt.

182
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
if we had time to give them unwanted sympathy.

183
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,000
The bloodstained security guard uniform was found at the scene,

184
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,040
and the security guard's motive for murder was clear, too.

185
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,200
How could I trust a kid's words 100%

186
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,240
and re-investigate it in that situation?

187
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,200
Is that all?

188
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,680
Are you sure you didn't have another reason?

189
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,760
What other reason could I have?

190
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,240
I am going to re-investigate the Yeongseong case properly.

191
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,320
- What? - Don't try to stop me.

192
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,440
If you try to stop me again,

193
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,120
that would mean you're really hiding something.

194
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,280
Don't disappoint me anymore.

195
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,160
Eun Ji-soo!

196
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
Ji-soo!

197
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
The caller cannot be reached. Please leave a message.

198
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,000
I have something to tell you. Call me.

199
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
(Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo)

200
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,520
(Spy)

201
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,600
Hey, Detective Lee.

202
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,640
Did you find Kim Song-hee's records?

203
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,280
It was from a small island called Muhyeong-do.

204
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,920
There's a record of Kim Song-hee receiving medical treatment

205
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,040
a month ago at the community health center on that island.

206
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,640
But Prosecutor Kang

207
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,160
already checked Kim Song-hee's medical record at dawn.

208
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,640
If Prosecutor Kang did it at dawn and you're telling me now??

209
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
Ugh, forget it. Why bother? Get off the phone.

210
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,320
Ah, Detective Eun, wait.

211
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,040
There's something else important.

212
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,600
What now?

213
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,240
Prosecutor Kang applied for temporary leave this morning.

214
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,040
He applied for temporary leave? Why?

215
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
I don't know.

216
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,040
The Deputy Director said that Prosecutor Kang sent her a text

217
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,160
asking her to forward the progress via e-mail,

218
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,960
but ever since then, he's been out of reach.

219
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,160
And the duration of his temporary leave was left indefinite.

220
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,240
Indefinite?

221
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,520
Prosecution Service is in complete chaos about Prosecutor Kang

222
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,160
being out of reach, and what he's doing.

223
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,440
Okay. I'll call you later.

224
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,320
Ugh, what is he thinking? That Kang Sung-mo. Seriously.

225
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,040
Humans are dirty, disgusting and horrible.

226
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,400
And the first person who made me feel that,

227
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,120
the person that I have resented all my life,

228
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
is your father.

229
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,240
Wow, it's so hard to peel.

230
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
It's off again.

231
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,760
Officer Yoon, the CCTV in front of the station is broken again.

232
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Officer Yoon.

233
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,240
Hello, this is Officer Yoon Jae-in at Seoheun Police Station.

234
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Hello?

235
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,040
Uh??Did you call for me?

236
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,960
You must be trying to be funny, but that's too old-fashioned.

237
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
When you do jokes like that,

238
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,400
you need to attach this to make it good.

239
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,920
The CCTV outside is broken, again.

240
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,560
I forgot to call the control center yesterday.

241
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,720
I'll do it right now.

242
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,120
And tell them to install one inside your head as well.

243
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,400
I need to see why you're like this today.

244
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,440
Officer Yoon, you have a fever.

245
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm okay.

246
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Is it him?

247
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
It isn't.

248
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,120
- Hi. - You're here every day.

249
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,160
Come on, I'm not here "every day."

250
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,120
Hey, Yoon Jae-in, have you seen Ahn?

251
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,320
No??Why?

252
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I can't get in touch with this jerk since last night.

253
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,160
You can't reach him?

254
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
If so, you should go to his house. Why are you here?

255
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,040
Wouldn't this place be faster?

256
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,800
Ah, but the car is here.

257
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,360
Ms. Kim came to work already.

258
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
- Does she look okay? - Do you think she would be?

259
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
She looks terrible. Like her.

260
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,920
Why do you look terrible?

261
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,200
Did you have a fight with Ahn?

262
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
I'm going on patrol.

263
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,240
Give all your bad memories to me.

264
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,920
At least from now on,

265
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,920
I will give nothing but good memories to you.

266
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,440
The person that I have resented all my life,

267
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,480
is your father.

268
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,760
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

269
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,080
(CCTV Recording)

270
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,760
Dad, I wondered why you drank such a bitter thing,

271
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,880
but I guess the day I reach for it is here.

272
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Hi.

273
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,120
- Let's go to the hospital. - It's none of your business.

274
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,640
What if you drop your baby while holding her with that wrist?

275
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Give her to me.

276
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,200
Eun-sol doesn't like strangers.

277
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
You're going to scare her.

278
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Are you sure she doesn't like strangers, huh?

279
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,760
She's laughing at me, right?

280
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,520
- Ha! - Eww, the smell.

281
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,840
Peek-a-boo!

282
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,160
Wow, Eun-sol, you have a pretty smile, like your mom.

283
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,880
But your mom doesn't know

284
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,600
that she's prettier when she smiles than when she's angry.

285
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
Peek-a-boo!

286
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Wow.

287
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,120
What did the doctor say?

288
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,120
The obvious. He told me not to use my wrist for a while.

289
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,960
Hey, he told you not to use it.

290
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,920
Eun-sol, your mom hurt her wrist.

291
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,880
You might see more of me for a while, huh?

292
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Jae-in.

293
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,160
What happened?

294
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,000
It's just??

295
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,640
It feels like I'm back and forth from heaven and hell today.

296
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,720
The caller cannot be reached. Please leave a message??

297
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,200
What's wrong with both of them?

298
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,520
Did they have a fight?

299
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,760
No, they got hurt at work. Both of them.

300
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,120
Ugh, by the way, why isn't he answering my calls?

301
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
By the way, you suddenly made progress.

302
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
You're even babysitting So-hyun's baby.

303
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,320
So much for progress.

304
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,920
Can't you see that I can't even eat with them?

305
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,840
What's with Ahn? You can't get in touch with him?

306
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,160
Well??

307
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,520
It seems that something happened between him and Yoon Jae-in.

308
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,000
If Yoon Jae-in is like that,

309
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
Ahn must be in a coma at least.

310
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,080
(Ji-soo)

311
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
(Ji-soo)

312
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,120
I must be really stupid.

313
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,080
No matter how much I think about it, there's no answer.

314
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,040
Mom, Dad, when I think of you,

315
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
I resent him,

316
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,200
no, I even resent her as well,

317
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
but I can't forget about

318
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
shaking her hand off.

319
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,240
I know how she must've felt when she held my hand,

320
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,120
and she didn't do anything wrong, but??

321
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,800
(Lee Ahn)

322
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,040
Ugh, why isn't he answering calls, either? Seriously.

323
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,360
Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

324
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,080
Get in. I'll take you.

325
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,080
I want to get some air. And sober up, too.

326
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,520
Your ankle is hurting.

327
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
It's better now.

328
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,320
I'll walk for a bit, and I'll take a taxi if it hurts.

329
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,720
So don't worry about me and go on.

330
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,480
Don't wander around too much, and go home, okay?

331
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,760
- I'll leave them to you. - Don't worry.

332
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,520
I'll take them to their home safely.

333
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,440
It's okay. You can go, too.

334
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
No, you're drunk.

335
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,040
Hey, still, wouldn't I be better than a chauffeur

336
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
whom you don't even know?

337
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,360
It's better to be taken home by someone I don't know.

338
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,400
I didn't drink so I can take you home, you know.

339
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
Whatever. I'm just going to take Eun-sol home,

340
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,840
so you can run or walk. Do as you wish.

341
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Hey, Lee Dae-bong.

342
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,800
Hey, get out!

343
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,040
Dae-bong is a nice guy.

344
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,600
I know.

345
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
I'm doing this because I know.

346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh, uh, hey! Hey, stop, stop!

347
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,720
How dare you take my daughter without my permission?

348
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Alright, fasten your seat belts.

349
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,680
I'm going home, too.

350
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Bye.

351
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Watch your foot.

352
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,800
Why can't you say it?

353
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,760
Why is Ji-soo making a fuss about

354
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,800
re-investigating the Yeongseong Apartments case?

355
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,640
You should know, because you were with her.

356
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,040
I don't know.

357
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,120
- You don't know? - Even if I do know,

358
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,120
I promised to stop spying for you, Commissioner.

359
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,240
Ugh, I seriously don't know anything. That's why.

360
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,680
- What did you report today? - Huh?

361
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,320
This isn't personal. This is official business.

362
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
Give me a progress report of what happened.

363
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,320
Yes, sir. Detective Eun Ji-soo

364
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,840
found out that the wanted woman in the composite sketch

365
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,800
has changed her identity to the name Kim Song-hee,

366
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,120
and now she went to find her.

367
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,120
So she found the woman, Kim Gap-yong protected with

368
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,840
fake identities and killed Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-yong for?

369
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,280
She hasn't found her yet. She went to find her.

370
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Anyway, Detective Eun left this morning,

371
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,240
and Prosecutor Kang applied for temporary leave

372
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,600
in order to go find that woman.

373
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,400
What does that woman have to do with the Yeongseong case?

374
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,680
Does she have something to do with the Yeongseong case?

375
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,960
Get out. You, get out, now!

376
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Yes, sir.

377
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
What on earth did they find out?

378
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:16,080
(Congratulations, Re-development of Yeongseong Apt. in 2019)

379
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
7th floor.

380
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,280
There's no way I can

381
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,160
see what happened on that day.

382
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
What?

383
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,160
So??Wait.

384
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
Jae-in's father is the culprit behind the Yeongseong Apt. fire?

385
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,640
Yes, and it seems that Ahn found out about it.

386
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,280
But even if he's shocked,

387
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,120
how could he just cut her off like that?

388
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,760
It's not Jae-in's fault.

389
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,280
Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

390
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,200
He did know that Jae-in is the daughter of a murderer.

391
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,640
He saw it written on the school wall,

392
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,360
but he still looked for her.

393
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
So why is he acting like that now?

394
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,760
Ahn's parents

395
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,040
passed away from the fire at Yeongseong Apartments.

396
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
What?

397
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm sorry I left you alone yesterday.

398
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,840
Have you eaten?

399
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
Did you sleep well?

400
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm not sure who I'm saying all this to.

401
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,720
It was in the car, so I brought it.

402
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,160
Did Yoon Jae-in give this to you?

403
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,880
I left the music box I made in the back seat.

404
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
I tried my best to make it, but I'm not sure you'll like it.

405
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,800
Seeing this at this moment

406
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,200
is too cruel.

407
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,920
Should I throw it away? I will, if you want me to.

408
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,120
Dae-bong.

409
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,280
You know??I??

410
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,720
I thought I really liked her.

411
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,240
But I guess not.

412
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,880
I ran away so quickly, like this.

413
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,120
Just liking her isn't going to solve this, you know.

414
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,600
Jae-in once asked me

415
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,880
when we found the body in the luggage,

416
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,280
if I seriously thought about

417
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,840
what kind of person she was,

418
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,120
how her family would feel,

419
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,160
and how she died like that.

420
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,120
Jae-in never brought up

421
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,280
her father with a casual, light tone,

422
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,400
but did I ever actually think about her pain?

423
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,040
I guess I just wanted to act like a hero

424
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,440
in front of Yoon Jae-in with a stupid power.

425
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,960
Just so I can look awesome.

426
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,880
Just so I can win her heart.

427
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,120
I talked like

428
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,080
I would take care of

429
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,000
all of her memories and wounds,

430
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,000
but I ended up hurting her the most.

431
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,440
I told her that I would save her,

432
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,880
but I ended up hurting her the most, with my hands!

433
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,160
Wow, look at your leg, it's so??

434
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,400
Well? Don't you feel better now?

435
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,000
Auntie, why did you raise me?

436
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,480
What are you saying, out of the blue?

437
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,960
After Dad got arrested, I got kicked out of town,

438
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,080
and all the relatives turned their backs on me, like I've sinned.

439
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,040
But why did you take me in?

440
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,000
You took me in.

441
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,680
I didn't take you in.

442
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:38,480
To tell you the truth, when I got divorced, I was pregnant.

443
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,160
But perhaps it was because I had bad thoughts,

444
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,840
the baby figured it out, and left me.

445
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,080
At first, it all seemed like it was my fault,

446
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,280
so tears fell down whenever I opened my eyes,

447
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,040
but ever since I began to live with you,

448
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,840
I slowly got better.

449
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,120
'That little girl is trying to survive and live her life,

450
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,000
so yes, I should survive and live on,

451
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,040
and endure it with her.' That's what I thought.

452
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
I'm sorry.

453
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,680
I was so busy with my wound, I didn't think about your pain.

454
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,600
All people live with wounds, big and small.

455
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,880
Everyone just endures and hides them. That's how we live.

456
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,240
I saw you studying with your mom.

457
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,160
You miss her too, right? Your mom.

458
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,240
Sung-mo. I am really going to miss you

459
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,120
if I can't see you.

460
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,920
I'd like to speak to Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo, please.

461
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,200
Prosecutor Kang is currently on a leave of absence.

462
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,520
Would you like me to pass on a message?

463
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,920
No, thank you. I will call again later.

464
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Did he finally find her?

465
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,160
(Detective Eun Ji-soo)

466
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,440
Hello?

467
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,000
Officer Yoon, it's me.

468
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,560
It's an emergency. Is Ahn with you?

469
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,640
No.

470
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,160
Why is it so hard to reach him?

471
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,200
This has never happened since he was in middle school.

472
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,120
Officer Yoon, by any chance,

473
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,720
did Prosecutor Kang contact you?

474
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,080
Prosecutor Kang?

475
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes, he suddenly disappeared.

476
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,920
Prosecutor Kang??

477
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,880
He came to the police station at dawn today.

478
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,240
Prosecutor Kang?

479
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,200
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo!

480
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,080
So he did go to you. I knew it.

481
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,480
If so, did you hear anything from Prosecutor Kang?

482
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,720
Why did you do that?

483
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,360
You knew everything about my dad already.

484
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,680
How could you do that when you knew it all along?

485
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,520
You knew Ahn's parents passed away from the fire at Yeongseong, and??

486
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,240
How could you tell me to help Ahn?

487
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,280
What right do I have to help Ahn?

488
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,120
Officer Yoon.

489
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,200
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

490
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
I know

491
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,520
that your father isn't the culprit.

492
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,160
What?

493
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,720
I can't explain everything at this moment,

494
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,040
but,

495
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,040
it will all be revealed soon.

496
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,120
Because I will make that happen.

497
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,760
Prosecutor Kang, why do you think

498
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,680
that my dad isn't the culprit?

499
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,560
Because the real culprit is someone else.

500
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,160
Just who is this culprit he has in his mind?

501
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,080
If it wasn't my dad, who??

502
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
Who set those apartments on fire, and why?

503
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,480
Detective Eun, you know something, right?

504
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,040
I don't know the details either,

505
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,280
but it seems that Prosecutor Kang's mother, who was thought

506
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,600
to have passed away from the fire at Yeongseong Apt., is alive.

507
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,360
And Prosecutor Kang left to confirm that.

508
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,000
What??is that about??

509
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,400
I'm so confused right now as well,

510
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,960
so I don't know how to explain this.

511
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,280
Anyway, I'm most worried about Ahn, as he will get shocked

512
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,080
again if he finds out that Prosecutor Kang disappeared.

513
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,240
If you get in touch with Ahn, please explain it to him.

514
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,600
I'll be in touch.

515
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,000
Because the real culprit is someone else.

516
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,720
Who is it?

517
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,160
I will join you.

518
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,320
No,

519
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,320
I have to join you.

520
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,360
What you need to do at this moment

521
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,960
is to be with Ahn. That's good enough.

522
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,720
I'm sure he needs some time,

523
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,200
but he will be back soon.

524
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,080
And so will I.

525
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,400
Where are you going this time?

526
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,960
(YSS Construction, do not build a crematory!)

527
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,120
(Muhyeong-do Ferry Time Table /3rd Voyage: 19:20)

528
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,640
Ugh, seriously.

529
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,800
(Seoheun Police Station)

530
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,680
Meet me somewhere else, besides the library.

531
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,760
Be careful, going back.

532
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,520
What is this?

533
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,560
"Please look after Yoon Jae-in!"

534
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,920
(Please look after Yoon Jae-in)

535
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Excuse me.

536
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,440
No, I mean, you do look familiar.

537
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,000
You're the prosecutor in charge of the hospital fire, right?

538
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,160
If a drop of hydrochloric acid hit your pretty face??

539
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,240
She became unpredictable, too.

540
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,320
This?

541
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,000
(My Big Bro Sung-mo)

542
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,160
(Ji-soo)

543
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,680
- Hello? - Why weren't you answering?

544
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,120
Ji-soo, Sung-mo's being weird.

545
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,040
He left something in my room,

546
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,640
and he's out of reach right now.

547
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Ahn.

548
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,120
Don't get shocked, and listen to me.

549
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,240
Prosecutor Kang applied for a temporary leave of absence.

550
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,120
- What? - It seems that his mother

551
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,560
is alive.

552
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,680
What??what are you talking about?

553
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,160
He went to Officer Yoon this morning

554
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,400
and told her not to worry because Yoon Tae-ha isn't the culprit,

555
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,960
and he left to find his mom.

556
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
No way.

557
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,800
How could Sung-mo's mom be alive?

558
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,040
That woman who lived as the dead Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young

559
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,440
is Kang Eun-joo, Prosecutor Kang's mother.

560
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,520
That woman wearing a ring. The one you saw.

561
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,480
What is the weird thing that he left in your room?

562
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,640
A map. He left a map.

563
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,680
What map?

564
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,000
It looks like the map of the area around Seoheun Police Station,

565
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,280
and I think he marked the places with and without CCTVs.

566
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,120
And??

567
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,080
He asked me to look after Yoon Jae-in.

568
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
Lee Ahn.

569
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,080
Listen to me carefully.

570
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,480
(Please look after Yoon Jae-in)

571
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Kang Sung-mo told me

572
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,840
that someone precious to him will be in danger

573
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,680
as he digs deeper into it.

574
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,640
He said, that bastard

575
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,520
will try to destroy someone precious to him.

576
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,480
I think Sung-mo was worried about Yoon Jae-in.

577
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,240
The CCTV has been cut off, again.

578
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,040
And the street light, too.

579
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,960
Someone keeps breaking the CCTV in front of the station.

580
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,440
This is the third time this month.

581
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,120
Answer it, answer it.

582
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,120
Yoon Jae-in. Yoon Jae-in.

583
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Yoon Jae-in!

584
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,040
Damn it.

585
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,920
(Yoon Jae-in)

586
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,840
Please, please.

587
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,400
(Lee Ahn)

588
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,280
1203??

589
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,120
Yoon Jae-in.

590
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,040
You know who this person is, right?

591
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,560
I will find this person

592
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,360
and kill him.

593
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
It's him.

594
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,280
(He is Psychometric)

595
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,000
What are you doing? Open the trunk!

596
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Get that bastard!

597
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,680
I'm sure Jae-in

598
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,080
left a trace of her for me.

599
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,080
I guess it may be unfair.

600
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:47,840
Because I can kill your girl.

601
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,000
Is he keeping it as a secret from you as well?

602
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,480
Ahn is no longer a kid crying about seeing weird things.

603
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,760
Looks like you know nothing yet.
