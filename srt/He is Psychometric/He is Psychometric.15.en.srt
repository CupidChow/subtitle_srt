(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
What on earth are you thinking?

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,840
I just want to reveal the truth.

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,280
Then why did you look for Kang Eun-joo

6
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,080
after the Hanmin Nursing Hospital incident?

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,160
Was it??all a lie?

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,520
Did you show me nothing but lies?

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,080
After the incident at Hanmin Nursing Hospital,

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,720
Mother disappeared.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,160
I'm going to hear why when I see her now.

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,080
Kang Eun-joo didn't meet you

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
because Kang Geun-taek told her that you were behind

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,560
the murder at Yeongseong Apartments.

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,920
Are you sure you didn't do it?

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
If I tell you I didn't do it, will you believe me?

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,920
No.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,360
I can't believe anything anymore!

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,240
I can come back, any time

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,200
if you have more questions.

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Sung-mo.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,760
Please don't kill me.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,040
I know it seems shameless,

24
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
but I don't want to die here.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
I'm sure that person is watching.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,400
The only person

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,040
who can save you.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Let's talk about it at home.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680

37
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,840
Let's go home, Mother.

38
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
Lieutenant Nam.

39
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,040
I know.

40
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,320
Detective Kim and Detective Park, watch them.

41
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Sung-mo.

43
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,480
You didn't do anything to him, right?

44
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,640
Right?

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,200
Did you know that Kim Gap-yong killed

46
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook?

47
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
Did you know that those women died because of me?

48
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,720
It wasn't because of you.

49
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,280
Kim Gap-yong tried to pressure me

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,000
by exploiting my weakness.

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
It was for his benefit.

52
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
It wasn't because of you.

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,480
You said that you'd catch that man and punish him.

54
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,320
Isn't that why you became a prosecutor?

55
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,400
I didn't become a prosecutor to catch him,

56
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,360
but to protect you and myself

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
from him.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,160
I thought that he wouldn't come near us anymore

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
if I had power.

60
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Since learning that no one was going to help us

61
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,720
after we escaped from the basement,

62
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,280
I have been killing him in my mind every single day.

63
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
So?

64
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Did you really kill him?

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,000
You either run away from or overcome

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,840
the tragedies of the past,

67
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,840
but we ended up at the same place, no matter how many times we ran.

68
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,320
I don't think our wounds will heal if we let the system

69
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,520
punish him and end it.

70
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Sung-mo.

71
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,800
Someone precious to me died.

72
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,600
I kept pushing her away, but she stayed by my side until the end,

73
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
and she ended up dead.

74
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,600
Even when those who made me feel the stories

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
you read to me from the books,

76
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,720
and those I only knew from texts,

77
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,680
were in danger one by one, because of me,

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,240
I couldn't do anything for them.

79
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,120
They became miserable

80
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
because of the wrong choice I made.

81
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
I told everything to the police.

82
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
That I knew about you being alive,

83
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,120
and that Kim Gap-yong had been protecting you

84
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,080
this whole time.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,960
So you don't need to hide what you know

86
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,440
from the police anymore.

87
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,760
There's no evidence proving that Prosecutor Kang

88
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,920
has kidnapped Kang Geun-taek.

89
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,800
Prosecutor Kang came to us because he knows that.

90
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,080
Did he really finish him off and return to us?

91
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,000
I saw Sung-mo locking up Kang Geun-taek for sure.

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
Sung-mo's trying to get his payback with Kang Geun-taek.

93
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,040
Anyway, you saw him kidnapping him,

94
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,280
but you didn't see him killing him, right?

95
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
But Kang Geun-taek didn't seem well.

96
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Wait.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
So what you're saying is,

98
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
it seems that Kang Geun-taek is alive, right?

99
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
If he's alive, how long can he stay that way?

100
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
They disappeared from Koo Yang National Hospital five days ago,

101
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
so if his gunshot wound hasn't been treated,

102
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,200
he's susceptible to tetanus or septic shock.

103
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
He's in a dangerous condition already.

104
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
I see, Dr. Hong.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Wow, there's no evidence,

106
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,440
so we can't keep Kang Sung-mo in the interrogation room.

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
Right now, what's important is

108
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
that Kang Geun-taek is behind the Hanmin Nursing Hospital case,

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,160
but the truth behind Yeongseong Apt.

110
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,880
and Kim Gap-yong is nowhere to be found.

111
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
If Sung-mo killed Kang Geun-taek,

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,720
we will never know what really happened at Yeongseong.

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,240
I mean??

114
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
How could he act like nothing happened?

115
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Especially in front of you and me!

116
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,920
Ahn.

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
You couldn't read Prosecutor Kang before,

118
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
but you saw Kang Geun-taek for sure today.

119
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,000
This is worth trying.

120
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,160
Let's go to Sung-mo.

I moved to this place recently.

This is where you're going to live from now on.

124
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,320
This is my room.

125
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,440
First, I need to clean this room.

126
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,800
You're still??

127
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,000
Still living with that boy, right?

128
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Yes.

129
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,320
He seemed to worry about you a lot.

130
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I know.

131
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,840
The only one that held me together all this time

132
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,320
was him.

135

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
Speak of the devil.

137
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,840
Lee Ahn, you clean my room.

138
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,760
The one who makes the mess must clean it, remember?

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,800
If I wanted to do so, I wouldn't have returned.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
Ahn, let's talk outside.

144
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,680
Officer Yoon, please look after my mother.

145
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,000
Where did you lock Kang Geun-taek up?

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,400
If he stays alive,

147
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
my mother and I have to keep living in hell.

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,720
Just tell me if you killed him or not.

149
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
Just tell me where you locked him up.

150
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,600
I can't tell you.

151
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,520
You can't do this to me.

152
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,880
If you hide the Yeongseong case suspect,

153
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,920
Jae-in and I can never find out what actually happened.

154
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,720
I understand why you want to kill him,

155
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
but you're not the only victim. We're??

156
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,680
We're victims, too.

157
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Yes.

158
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,000
I did want to kill him with my own hands.

159
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
I wanted to tear him into pieces.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,760
If you had been locked up in a basement for nine years

161
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,160
or saw my mother afterward, who was

162
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,080
anxiously and miserably on the run,

163
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,400
you would be able to understand me better.

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,080
I do understand.

165
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,560
But this! This isn't the right way.

166
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
I know that it isn't the right way.

167
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,800
But you can't undo the past,

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
and this is the best for now.

169
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,800
Please don't do this, Sung-mo. I beg you.

170
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
Please just tell me where Kang Geun-taek is.

171
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm not too late, am I?

172
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,920
I've missed you so much, Sung-mo.

173
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
He's not dead yet.

174
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,160
If he's dead, I'm sure I would've seen that in his memories.

175
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm so sorry.

177
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,480
I should've gone back

178
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,480
and testified that the security guard wasn't the culprit.

179
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,720
If I did??

180
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,720
he wouldn't have been falsely accused as the culprit.

181
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,320
I was too weak at the time

182
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,080
to think about the lives of the others.

183
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,480
Please get up.

184
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,120
I will testify honestly about everything.

185
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,840
I won't run away anymore.

186
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,840
You left Yeongseong Apt. before the incident,

187
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,680
so I'm sure you don't know what happened that day.

188
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,680
Did Prosecutor Kang

189
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,960
tell you about Sae Ki Dong Station?

190
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,760
Sung-mo, it's me.

191
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,960
Yes.

192
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,120
(Swept the panhandling gang)

193
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,040
This panhandling gang that was hiding

194
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
on Basement Floor 3 of Sae Ki Dong Station.

195
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,840
That case??It's connected to him, right?

196
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,920
Right?

197
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,760
Yes, the scar around the neck

198
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,360
and the undocumented status all match that case.

199
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,840
I don't know where Kang Geun-taek is right now,

200
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,040
but moving through and hiding in ghost stations

201
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
is a great way to hide from people,

202
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
so there's a high possibility of him still doing so.

203
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm still looking into it.

204
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,800
Please wait.

205
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,600
I'll make sure you can live under your real name soon.

206
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
That was the only information I knew about him,

207
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,360
and that was my last phone call with Sung-mo.

208
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,000
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young, who have been found dead

209
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,640
inside luggage at the lower half of Han River last month,

210
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,640
were involved with a human trafficking gang five years ago,

211
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,880
and it has been revealed that they were murdered by

212
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,200
Kim Gap-yong, an action-taker of the gang.

213
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,040
On the day I tried to commit suicide after finding out that

214
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
Kim Gap-yong killed Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook,

215
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,520
I woke up with this thought.

216
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,280
That I'll kill him with my own hands and end it.

217
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,800
So I went to Sae Ki Dong Station

218
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,080
as my last resort.

219
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
I should've killed him

220
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,040
and ended everything.

221
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Running away from Yeongseong Apartments at the time

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,040
wouldn't have solved anything.

224
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
I'm??

225
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm so sorry.

226
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,840
I did once think

227
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,040
that my father was the culprit.

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,320
I didn't do it,

229
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,920
but I couldn't sleep, and couldn't breathe, out of guilt.

230
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,920
And then I read an online post.

231
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,000
It said that the worst punishment from God

232
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,320
is time.

233
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,080
The punishment of time, in which you have to go back and forth

234
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,840
between hope and despair endlessly,

235
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,040
and hang on.

236
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
While my father was in prison,

237
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm sure both you and Prosecutor Kang

238
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,520
have been going through that punishment of time.

239
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
That's why he supported me secretly, too.

240
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,920
I'm not forgiving you.

241
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm saying,

242
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,000
I understand you,

243
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,320
just a little bit, a tiny bit??

244
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,960
- Where's Ahn? - He left.

245
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I made Ahn extremely angry.

246
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,040
You lured us to Sae Ki Dong Station on purpose

247
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,680
to find Kang Eun-joo, right?

248
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,920
And you didn't think that

249
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,320
Ahn would read about Kang Kook Station as well.

250
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Yes.

251
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
I wanted to find my mother

252
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,760
and end it, without anyone getting hurt.

253
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Let's say that it was the last bit of my conscience

254
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,160
for Ahn and you,

255
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,160
the victims of the Yeongseong Apt. incident.

256
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,640
If you found out where Kang Geun-taek was,

257
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,120
you should've asked Detective Eun for help.

258
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
Detective Eun was worried and concerned about you

259
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,480
more than anyone else.

260
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,440
The only case in which Kang Geun-taek left his fingerprints

261
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,080
was the confinement case in Gangnyeong.

262
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
We have evidence and victims,

263
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,200
but its statute of limitations has passed.

264
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
And there is no piece of evidence,

265
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,120
found in these murders, that points to

266
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
Kang Geun-taek as the culprit.

267
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,120
But it's different now.

268
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,240
We found Kang Eun-joo, a witness at Hanmin,

269
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,840
and we have you, a witness of the murder of Detective Eun Ji-soo.

270
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,920
The punishment of time, locked up in a prison,

271
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,920
is only felt by humans with emotions.

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,120
It's meaningless for monsters like Kang Geun-taek.

273
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,000
I did see something.

274
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
TS Bowling Center.

275
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
Geonam Fire Station.

276
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,400
Dohyeon High School is the school I went to.

277
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,000
Why was that??

278
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,880
Dae-bong, it's me. I have a favor to ask you.

279
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,240
I did see them,

280
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,360
but I don't know why I saw them.

281
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360
These places have nothing to do with Sung-mo.

282
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,840
I checked on my way,

283
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,600
and none of these places are closed.

284
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,160
I don't think he could've locked Kang Geun-taek up at any of them.

285
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,520
Ahn, Lee Ahn.

286
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
- Oh, you're here. - I printed the map out.

287
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,840
This is Dohyeon High School, the school we went to,

288
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,120
and TS Bowling Center is here,

289
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,800
and Geonam Fire Station is on the opposite side.

290
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,880
Did he see these buildings on his way to the place of kidnapping?

291
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,000
Dae-bong, how far are these three places apart?

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,400
- Are they connected by a street? - Uh, no.

293
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,960
Dohyeon High School is in Dohyeon-dong,

294
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,680
TS Bowling Center is in Sae Ki Dong,

295
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,320
and Geonam Fire Station is on the opposite side, Geonam-dong.

296
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,080
And the way to these places aren't connected by a street,

297
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
but on twisty and different roads.

298
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,080
What the heck?

299
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,400
Do we have to find the common features of these three places?

300
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
Didn't you see anything else besides these?

301
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
I know all about the geography of this area.

302
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,640
The rest were all memories from the past.

303
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,920
As hard as I tried to see them,

304
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,000
I only saw Sung-mo's good memories of me.

305
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,800
These places are all close from here, so let's check them out.

306
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,440
Something new might come up if we see them.

307
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,760
- Thank you, Dae-bong. - No problem.

308
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
Call me if you need anything else.

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
Which direction did you see

311
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,720
this bowling center?

312
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
It wasn't this direction.

313
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,560
I think I saw this direction.

314
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,880
This isn't a straight course to Geonam Fire Station

315
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
or Dohyeon High School, either.

316
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Did he go around on purpose?

317
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,560
Are you sure it was this direction?

318
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,400
Yes, I am sure, but??

319
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,720
The buildings you saw

320
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,960
are all in the same direction.

321
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,880

No, it wasn't this close.

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,520
I think I saw it??a bit farther away.

325
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
A bit farther?

326
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,120
How much farther?

327
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,000
Then did you see Dohyeon High School and Geonam Fire Station

328
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,080
from far away, too?

(Geonam Fire Station)

331
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,440
Jae-in.

332
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,280
These aren't the buildings where he's holding him

333
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,800
or the ones he saw on his way to kidnap him.

334
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,160
He saw them all at once while looking down from somewhere.

335
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,520
From someplace high, like a rooftop?

336
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
Or is he looking down from where he's holding him?

337
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,280
Then let's find the building where you can see all of them.

338
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,040
They haven't moved?

339
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,760
No, they're still at home, and??

340
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,240
Prosecutor Kang went shopping in the morning and returned.

341
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,760
What? He went shopping?

342
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Yes, if he went shopping for groceries after killing someone,

343
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,760
he really is one scary bastard.

344
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,040
Call me if anything changes.

345
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
What about Kang Sung-mo's car?

346
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
We did find it??

347
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,320
but it's been parked at a public parking lot since a week ago.

348
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,120
He got it back before coming to the station yesterday.

349
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,760
What about Kang Sung-mo's call logs?

350
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Ever since his leave of absence, he hasn't received

351
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,080
or made any calls.

352
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
It has been confirmed that he sometimes turned on his phone,

353
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,040
but that was all before the Kang Kook Station incident.

354
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,840
Turned on his phone? Where?

355
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,040
Near Muhyeong-do, where Kang Eun-joo was.

356
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,680
And it was turned off

357
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,040
in front of the hospital where Officer Yoon was admitted.

358
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,440
The hospital she was admitted to after she was kidnapped?

359
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
It seems that Prosecutor Kang went to that hospital.

360
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,280
He knew that Officer Yoon was kidnapped by Kang Geun-taek

361
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,320
and that Detective Eun was murdered,

362
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,240
so Prosecutor Kang has a ton of motives to kill Kang Geun-taek.

363
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,480
- But something's weird. - What?

364
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
This phone number.

365
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,920
It called Prosecutor Kang,

366
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,120
even more than Detective Eun or Lee Ahn.

367
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,560
It called him a few times a day, even after his leave of absence.

368
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,680
This person must've been desperate.

369
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Could it have been Kang Geun-taek?

370
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
I don't think so.

371
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,520
It continued, even after Kang Geun-taek was kidnapped.

372
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,160
Should we find out whom this number belongs to?

373
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,920
We're busy as hell, there's no time to go around.

374
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Give it to me.

375
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,120
Hello, this is Noh Jung-hoon.

376
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,000
Prosecutor General, Noh Jung-hoon?

377
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,160
Ah, hello, I'm Detective Nam Dae-nam.

378
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm in charge of re-investigating the Yeongseong Apartments case.

379
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,080
What made you call me, Detective Nam Dae-nam?

380
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,160
We're tracking down Prosecutor Kang's phone

381
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,080
and we found your number.

382
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,640
Ah.

383
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,600
He suddenly disappeared after applying for a leave of absence,

384
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,720
so I got worried and called him.

385
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,400
Not a colleague, not the Chief Prosecutor,

386
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,200
but you, the Prosecutor General, called him directly?

387
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,480
You could've had someone else do it for you.

388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,000
What are you trying to say?

389
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Uh, nevermind. I'll call you back.

390
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,880
Wow, I provoked him a bit, and he freaked out right away.

391
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,000
Call Prosecutor Kang's deputy director

392
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,200
- and tell her to meet us now. - Yes, sir.

What on earth are you doing?

402

Are you trying to get us all killed, or save yourself?

403

I'm saying let's do this properly, now.

404

What did you say when I told you not to

mess with Dragon Head Hunting?

406

440

The police are strongly against it.

441

Why are you pushing it ahead?

442
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,080
Is it true that the Yeongseong case is connected to

443
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
the special prosecution team on YSS Construction's corruption?

444

Why is the prosecution suddenly trying to lead the investigation?

449
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Because the Yeongseong Apartment fire

450

is connected to the corruption of YSS Construction, making a mess.

we won't lose the investigation to the prosecution,

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,280
Don't you watch the news?!

494
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,800
Jae-in's father isn't the culprit,

495
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,040
there's another suspect.

496
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,440
Ugh.

497
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,120
Ugh, seriously! Ugh!

498
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,280
Ugh, seriously!

499
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,240
To the stairs! Take the stairs!

500
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,640
Lower your bodies as much as you can!

501
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,320
Oh, Mr. Kim!

502
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,000
Take the stairs! The stairs!

503
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,840
So-hyun, let's go.

504
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,960
You picked it up from the hallway?

505
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,000
The uniform said Yoon Tae-ha,

506
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
and it was bloodstained,

507
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,080
so I thought he was the culprit!

508
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,960
Then how could you testify that

509
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,840
the security guard gave it to me?

510
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,680
I wasn't the only one who pointed to him!

511
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,480
Everyone in the building

512
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,640
said that it looked like the security guard did it!

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Though conflicting stories came out later??

514
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,760
Conflicting stories?

515
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,000
After the case was closed,

516
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,080
the people in the building said

517
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,880
that your dad wasn't on the 7th floor from the beginning,

518
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,200
but that he guided people from the top floor and came down.

519
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,840
And the biggest problem was the fire safety system not working.

520
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,040
There was also a rumor about the President of Women's Society

521
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,760
being bribed by the company that built Yeongseong Apt.

522
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,840
Can I please get the contact info of those who said that?

523
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,080
My dad is looking into it right now.

524
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,600
Thank you, So-hyun.

525
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,840
No need to thank me. I am the one that's sorry.

526
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,600
- I'll call you later. - Okay.

527
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,240
Remember our first and last picnic

528
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,440
after we escaped from the basement?

529
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,120
The weather was just like this.

530
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,320
Yes.

531
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,760
We went on that picnic

532
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,000
to live a normal life

533
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,440
like nothing happened, by eating kimbap

534
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,240
and taking photos, like other families??

535
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,280
But you cried the whole time.

536
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,480
You were watching the animals in their cages.

537
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,240
I couldn't understand why you were crying, and couldn't comfort you.

538
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,840
We clearly weren't your average mom and son.

539
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,080
You did comfort me.

540
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,840
You held my hand tight.

541
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
How about I tell you a funny story?

542
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,240
A funny story?

543
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Do you know what Article 10 of

544
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,920
the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says?

545
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,640
Is this a riddle?

546
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
I guess you can say that.

547
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,760
I don't know.

548
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,080
What's the answer?

549
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,160
"All citizens shall be assured of

550
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,000
human worth and dignity

551
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,480
and have the right to pursuit of happiness."

552
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,920
"It shall be the duty of the State

553
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,320
to confirm and guarantee the fundamental and inviolable

554
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,920
human rights of individuals."

555
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Isn't it funny?

556
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
It is funny.

557
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,080
Looks like they're going far.

558
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,400
Where do you think they are they going?

559
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,120
Are they trying to run away by any chance?

560
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,120
No one's going to run away in front of my eyes again.

561
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,720
A bribery ledger book seized from

562
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,280
Dragon Head Hunting has disappeared?

563
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,120
Yes. Detective Lee, you remember them too, right?

564
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,640
There were exactly five

565
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,200
ledger books seized.

566
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,960
Didn't we turn all of them in

567
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,040
to the special prosecution team as soon as we got them?

568
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,320
I thought so too,

569
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,480
but it turned out that Prosecutor Kang only turned in four of them

570
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,960
to the special prosecution team on YSS Construction's slush funds.

571
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,800
So the prosecution is dying to find that, huh?

572
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,520
The four must've gone into the shredder,

573
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,760
and the remaining one is in Prosecutor Kang's possession?

574
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,200
What is he trying to do with that??

575
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Hello?

576
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Okay, get off the phone.

577
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,560
Hey, Officer Yoon, where are you?

578
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,120
I'm still looking for the place Ahn saw.

579
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,000
A body has risen from the bottom of the Han River,

580
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,800
and they think it's Kang Geun-taek. Go to Dr. Hong.

581
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,360
What are they doing? Why are they at a district court?

582
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,560
They're here to recover Kang Eun-joo's identity.

583
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,600
Ugh, thank goodness.

584
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,040
I thought they were trying to flee from Gangwon-do

585
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,960
on a boat, and I was scared to death.

586
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,160
But why aren't they coming out?

587
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,400
There they are.

588
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,760
(Gangnyeong District Court)

589
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,440
Is it all done now?

590
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,480
Yes.

591
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,520
This is under my name,

592
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,000
but when your ID is out, change it to yours.

593
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,080
The documents are certified,

594
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,480
so it will be confirmed soon.

595
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay.

596
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,280
Then, are you leaving now?

597
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,400
You promised not to cry,

598
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
if you do, I can't do your favor.

599
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,800
Okay, I won't.

600
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
I will never cry.

601
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,480
From now on, don't look around,

602
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,920
and only look forward.

603
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,160
Okay?

604
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,000
What the heck? Why is Prosecutor Kang going back in?

605
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,320
- Hurry and follow him. - What the heck?

606
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,840
Where's Prosecutor Kang going?

607
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,840
He said he had unfinished business.

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
Sung-mo??

609
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,840
Sung-mo??

610
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,280
What the heck? Why is Kang Eun-joo crying?

611
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,160
Detective Park, looks like this jerk is trying to run away.

612
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,280
Go after him right now.

613
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Police.

614
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,680
You're a bit too late.

615
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,640
This body has been found by the prosecution,

616
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,960
so you should stay out of it.

617
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,440
Now's not the time to argue about police or prosecution.

618
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,200
Dr. Hong, Dr. Hong?

619
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
- Who are you? - Dr. Hong.

620
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,360
He's not a police officer.

621
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,920
I called for him because I need him to do something.

622
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Come in.

623
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,440
The body has decomposed quite a bit,

624
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,880
so we can't identify him by his external features.

625
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,760
He has a gunshot wound on his arm,

626
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,960
but is he really Kang Geun-taek?

627
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,480
(Eunam Police Station/50s /Male/Unidentified/Heart attack)

628
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,000
He isn't Kang Geun-taek.

629
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,560
He's a homeless man who died of a heart attack.

630
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,920
I think that woman out there is trying to

631
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,720
turn a John Doe into Kang Geun-taek.

632
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,520
Do they think we're stupid? Damn it.

633
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,760
I got it. I'll take care of things here.

634
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,080
The prosecution announced that the body found in the Han River

635
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,320
is presumed to be Kang Geun-taek, the suspect.

636
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,800
So the prosecution is trying to close this case

637
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,000
as quickly as possible, going so far as to producing a fake body

638
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,880
because of YSS Construction's corruption, right?

639
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,120
Things are not going pretty.

640
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,480
What's the problem here?

641
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,080
That body isn't Kang Geun-taek, for sure.

642
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,360
Power can spin lies into truths.

643
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,640
If the prosecution makes an announcement

644
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,160
saying that Kang Geun-taek committed suicide,

645
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,640
the truth about Yeongseong Apt. will be covered up, again.

646
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Let's trust Dr. Hong.

647
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,000
She won't let this slide.

648
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,120
I have a good idea.

649
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,480
I told you.

650
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,400
This body isn't Kang Geun-taek.

651
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,920
His fingerprints and blood aren't a match at all.

652
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,040
And his cause of death isn't drowning. It's a heart attack.

653
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,600
Furthermore, this gunshot wound

654
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,720
was made after his death.

655
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,760
Look, this wound was made after his death,

656
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,240
so his skin has become leather-like, due to it drying.

657
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,480
It's all been settled by the higher-ups.

658
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
Please sign it to confirm it as suicide.

659
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,200
So you're telling me to just shut up and sign it?

660
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,200
How funny.

661
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,080
I've only seen this in movies. This is the first time for me.

662
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,480
Prosecutor, looks like you've been doing this a lot, huh?

663
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,160
Sign it, will you?

664
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,040
If you don't want to get fired.

665
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,120
Aren't you ashamed to do this?

666
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,600
If it has been confirmed that the dead body at Yeongseong

667
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,160
wasn't Kang Eun-joo but someone else,

668
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,720
this case would've ended quickly.

669
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,080
You guys were the problem,

670
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
but we were a part of it, too. Get it?

671
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,080
Watch your mouth.

672
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,800
How dare you act so arrogantly?

673
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,600
I am doing this job with a sense of duty,

674
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,320
but if you smash it,

675
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,080
I have no reason to be here.

676
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,560
If you don't want to do it, then stay out of it.

677
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,520
There are tons of people to sign it.

678
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,800
(Officer Yoon Jae-in)

679
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,840
Yes, Detective.

680
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm sorry for keeping you, I had to take care of something.

681
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,600
Ah, did you hear everything?

682
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,280
And you recorded it, too?

683
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,600
Yeah, things are so messy right now,

684
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,120
so you need to focus and find the real Kang Geun-taek soon.

685
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,240
Bye.

686
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,120
Let's see who gets fired first.

687
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,880
Furthermore, this gunshot wound was made after his death.

688
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,920
Look, this wound was made after his death,

689
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,440
so his skin has become leather-like, due to it drying.

690
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,760
It's all been settled by the higher-ups.

691
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,160
Please sign it to confirm it as suicide.

692
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,440
We have crucial evidence.

693
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,160
I taught you well, Officer Yoon.

694
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,960
Will this hold up in court?

695
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,480
I read that, secret recordings can't be presented as evidence.

696
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,400
Whether it holds up in court or not,

697
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,880
if they know that we have such evidence,

698
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,360
the prosecution won't be able to push forward

699
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,040
with a fake body.

700
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Yes?

701
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,000
What do you mean?

702
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,960
You lost Prosecutor Kang?

703
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,880
You jerks, can't you do anything right?

704
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,720
(Prosecutor General Noh Jung-hoon)

705
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Kang Sung-mo, where are you?

706
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
If you're trying to threaten me with a ledger, then stop it.

707
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
I won't threaten you. I want to make a deal.

708
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,640
A deal?

709
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,240
Sure, what do you want?

710
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,120
Prosecutor Kang's phone has been located.

711
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,200
The last location was??where?

712
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,160
Yusu 1, Dohyeon-dong, Seoul?

713
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,880
He had his last call with the Prosecutor General,

714
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,360
and the phone was turned off 15 minutes ago.

715
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,680
He had a call with the Prosecutor General?

716
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,920
Is he trying to him to cover up

717
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,600
the murder of Kang Geun-taek by using that ledger as the bait?

718
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,080
Wait. Dohyeon-dong??

719
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,320
It's around the places you saw.

720
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,840
Sung-mo is trying to go to Kang Geun-taek.

721
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,000
You guys, search the places Ahn saw,

722
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,880
and Detective Lee, search the area with me and the backup.

723
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
The search should focus on empty houses and empty buildings.

724
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
Yes, sir.

725
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,680
Lieutenant Nam, the building must be five stories or taller.

726
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
Okay.

727
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,680
Officer Yoon.

728
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,200
Did you forget that you're after two murder suspects?

729
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,400
Here.

730
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,160
If you come across anything definite, you must call us first.

731
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,800
If you two do things on your own, you're doomed.

732
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Yes, sir.

733
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Let's go.

734
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,160
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

735
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
What's wrong?

736
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,280
Uh??

737
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,640
I don't know, but all of a sudden??

738
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,000
my chest ached.

739
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,240
Your chest?

740
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,840
Is?? Is it because you touched that body earlier?

741
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,600
That homeless man died of a heart attack.

742
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,160
It passed.

743
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,120
The wound will soon start to throb and fester.

744
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,160
And then it'll slowly rot.

745
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,680
Oh, but you see,

746
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,720
I still don't really know what pain is.

747
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,080
Don't worry.

748
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,200
I will make sure that you feel it.

749
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,880
This isn't the place. It must be farther away.

750
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's go.

751
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,040
Yes, Lieutenant Nam.

752
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,920
So no one has found anything over there either, right?

753
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,120
Yes, I see.

754
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,720
It's getting more and more similar to what I saw.

755
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,560
I'm sure it's around here.

756
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,680
Let's go up.

757
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,320
Yes, I think this is the place.

758
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,000
- How is it? - The altitude seems similar.

759
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,080
I can see Dohyeon High School,

760
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,920
Geonam Fire Station, the bowling center, and the crosses.

761
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,160
But this building has no vacant spaces.

762
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
Nothing's wrong with the CCTVs, either.

763
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,440
Are you saying that this isn't the place, either?

764
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,920
I'll go to the rooftop.

765
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,480
You look for any other tall building around here.

766
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Okay.

767
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,800
Just where is it?

768
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,040
Where is it?

769
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
Lee Ahn.

770
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,880
I asked Lieutenant Nam to

771
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,080
search all of the tall buildings around here.

772
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,680
- Jae-in. - Huh?

773
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,320
Those??

774
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,040
Those are Yeongseong Apartments, right?

775
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,760
Yes, that's right.

776
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,840
When I transferred to your school,

777
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,200
I could see Yeongseong Apartments far away, from the school rooftop.

778
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,520
I remember it clearly.

779
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,280
No way??

780
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,880
Do you remember when we went back to Yeongseong Apt.?

781
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,000
There was a banner hanging,

782
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,120
that announced the re-development.

783
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,000
An announcement on the re-development was

784
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,200
telling everyone to move out by January 19.

785
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,160
So that means those apartments are empty now, right?

786
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,400
If the view was from this high,

787
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,080
he's been locked up on??the 10th floor?

788
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,440
No,

789
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,040
8th floor?

790
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,840
Maybe unit 702, where the murder took place??

791
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,280
Damn it.

792
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,520
Kang Geun-taek may be confined in unit 702.

793
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,120
Kang Sung-mo might be there, so don't let your guard down.

794
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,160
- Go. - Yes, sir.

795
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Hurry up.

796
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
Is it hurting again?

797
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,480
I'm okay. Let's hurry.

798
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Break it.

799
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,840
Please don't kill me.

800
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,120
I know it seems shameless,

801
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,000
but I don't want to die here.

802
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,640
I'm sure that person is watching.

803
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,160
The only person

804
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,200
who can save you.

805
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,120
Jae-in.

806
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,400
He's in the smallest room.

807
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,840
Check him.

808
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,040
He's still alive.

809
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
Detective Lee, you know how dangerous he is, right?

810
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,120
- Watch him carefully. - Yes, sir.

811
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,200
Kang Geun-taek is going down. Everyone, focus.

812
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,400
Looks like he needs surgery immediately.

813
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,120
Necrosis of his skin has already begun.

814
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,640
We have to find Sung-mo.

815
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,000
It's not over yet.

816
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There's a good chance that Kang Sung-mo is still here,

817
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,680
so search the whole building,

818
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,160
search every single unit.

819
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,640
Let's go.

820
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,120
Who is it?

821
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,360
May I attend the meeting on my mom's behalf, please?

822
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,120
My mom??told me to go in her place.

823
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,920
Sure, come in.

824
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,320
How could she send her kid in her place?

825
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,600
I know, right?

826
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
What are you doing? Come sit here.

827
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,040
One moment, please.

828
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,160
I got out of unit 701

829
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,440
and went to unit 1501 to meet the police officer who

830
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,120
offered to help me, but it was empty.

831
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,120
And then I found out about the fire.

832
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,120
I tried to go to my house to check what happened,

833
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,160
but I couldn't, because of the smoke.

834
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,120
And at that moment, I met Yoon Tae-ha

835
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,040
and Lee Ahn in front of the elevator.

836
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,040
Sung-mo didn't come to see my dad.

837
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,000
He was in unit 702 at that time.

838
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,160
Sung-mo.

839
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,240
I have a favor to ask you.

840
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,760
Promise me that you will do as I say from now on.

841
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,640
Then how about we each do a favor for each other?

842
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,440
Sung-mo.

843
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,960
Don't hide anything from me,

844
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,640
and tell me the truth.

845
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,240
Don't hide the truth about what happened at

846
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,920
Yeongseong Apartment anymore.

847
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,240
I don't want to run away from the past anymore.

848
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,000
Winter strawberries are the best strawberries.

849
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
They're delicious.

850
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,480
Hey, you!

851
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,400
Where are you going?

852
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,120
What's all this?

853
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,440
Just what is he thinking?

854
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,920
(Resident Registration Card: Kang Eun-joo)

855
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
A knife.

856
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,400
Lighters.

857
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,040
Mom's ID.

858
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,120
A burnt woman.

859
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,040
(Gangcheon Police Station Lee Jung-rok)

860
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,240
I have to see it until the end.

861
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,080
What is it?

862
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,440
Do you have something to say to me?

863
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
What's that bag?

864
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,040
I'm sorry.

865
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680
Huh?

866
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,280
That voice??

867
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,080
Ma'am! Oh, no!

868
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,120
Oh, no! What's wrong?

869
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Lee Ahn!

870
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Ahn!

871
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,760
Wake up, Ahn! Ahn!

872
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
No way.

873
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,160
Emergency, emergency.

874
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,200
Unit 702. Lee Ahn is injured.

875
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,800
Currently not breathing, no pulse.

876
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,720
Call for emergency rescue, call for emergency rescue!

877
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,720
(He is Psychometric)

878
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,000
You expected this day to come, didn't you?

879
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,920
You made me and Jae-in meet,

880
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,120
and asked Jae-in to train my power.

881
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,000
It's unit 1501.

882
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,480
You're under arrest

883
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,520
according to Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

884
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,760
Lieutenant Nam, you already knew that it was due to

885
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,560
the corruption of YSS Construction.

886
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,880
We need to tie them tightly, and put them in prison.

887
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,160
Are you telling me to leave it out if something goes wrong?

888
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,080
Having Kang Eun-joo take the stand is the only way, right?

889
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,600
I didn't kill anybody.

890
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,000
Are you saying that it's there?
