00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,320
I didn't hear anything about anyone moving in today.

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm sure this place will be safe.

6
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,320
Sung-mo,

7
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600
he will find me, again.

8
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
Perhaps this won't end until I die.

9
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,440
If he ever appears in front of you again, I'll kill him.

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,040
So don't worry anymore.

11
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,520
If you do such a thing,

12
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
I'll be even sadder.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,680
I'll feel pain.

14
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,160
I told you about what it means to

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,640
feel pain and be sad, right?

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
I know.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
That your heart is suffering.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,960
The emotion you feel

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,040
when someone dies or you lose something precious.

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Yes, that emotion.

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,200
So, if you kill someone,

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
I will die, too.

does that mean you found out about the life that I led as well?

92

to never appear in front of me ever again.

For today, I'm just here to see how much information

you have on me.

123
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,680
I thought about it, but facing you one on one

124
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,880
seems pretty reckless now.

Yeah.

126
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,120

for a real person?

134
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
No.

I've only been thinking about killing you.

137
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,040
I've been thinking about how to pay you back

138

in the most painful and cruel way.

139
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,720
That's all I've been thinking about.

140
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,480
Yes.

141
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,040
That's why Eun-joo left you, too.

142
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Because she found out that

143
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,640
you're a monster as well, and you can't be helped.

144
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,280
You have truly

145
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,400
inherited my blood.

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
Shut up.

147
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,360
Even if you escape from this place,

148
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,960
you won't be able to hide anywhere else anymore.

149
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,080
I've already looked into everything about you.

150
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
Is that so?

151
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,160
See you later.

She just passed out.

155
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,000
We gave her first aid, so she will wake up soon.

156
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,360
So she is Kang Hee-sook??

No, no??Kim Song-hee?

158

162
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,880

Kang Sung-mo.

164
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,680
Drop that knife.

165
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,320
Don't come this way, Eun Ji-soo.

166
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,200
The first was a blank round, but the second is real.

167
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
Please, drop the knife!

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Get out of here right now!

170
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Now!

171
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,720
I know why you want to kill him.

172
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
And I know why you don't trust the police, either.

173
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,080
But Kang Sung-mo.

174
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,800
You should give me a chance, too.

175
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
Ji-soo, please don't come this way.

176
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,280
Please don't come this way.

177
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
No!

178
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,040
Ji-soo!

179
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Eun Ji-soo!

180
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Ji-soo!

181
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
See?

182
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Kang Sung-mo isn't a monster.

183
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
No!

184
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,360
If you were a monster, you would've chased after him.

185
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
And leave me here.

186
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,920
Please, please, Ji-soo.

187
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,280
We found your mother.

188
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,840
So let's go back.

189
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,640
Killing that bastard

190
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
won't heal your wound.

191
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,120
It'll only become a bigger wound.

192
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
So please??

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,120
Come back with me.

194
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,040
Kang Sung-mo.

195
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,880
Ji-soo, wake up!

196
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Ji-soo!

197
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
Wake up!

198
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,120
Ji-soo, no!

199
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,680
No!

200
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,600
No!

201
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,760
An injured individual at Kang Kook Station, Basement Floor 3.

202
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,120
We need 911 backup. We need 911 backup.

203
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,000
The suspect has fled the scene.

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Requesting backup from all nearby units.

205
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,240
I repeat. The suspect has stabbed a police officer

206
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,280
and is now on the run. All available units

207
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,600
near Kang Kook Station, be on the lookout for the suspect.

208
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,120
Is the victim, Detective Eun Ji-soo?

209
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
Please identify the victim.

210
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,480
Please identify the victim!

211
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,600
The injured individual at Kang Kook Station, Basement Floor 3.

212
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,040
is Detective Eun Ji-soo of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

213
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,160
The suspect is wearing a black jacket and a black cap,

214
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,120
he's on the run, and he has sustained a gunshot wound.

215
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,240
Requesting backup from all nearby units.

216
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,480
Check which hospital she was taken to

217
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,720
and call me immediately.

218
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
Where are you right now?

219
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm in front of Kang Kook Station.

220
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,600
Kang Geun-taek fled the scene.

221
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
What?

222
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,160
And Detective Eun??

223
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,160
She's been stabbed.

224
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,480
The police are on their way there,

225
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,320
so don't do anything dangerous.

226
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
Are you listening to me?

227
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,760
Okay, two of you, guard the entrance,

228
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
and the rest of you, follow me.

229
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Kang Geun-taek avoided CCTVs

230
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,080
and moved through ghost stations,

231
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,680
so no one would see him for his entire life.

232
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,760
I think he learned how to move without being seen

233
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,120
when he was in the panhandling gang.

234
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Where he would flee to??

235
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,680
Someplace with no CCTVs,

236
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,360
someplace where he's not likely to be seen by others.

237
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,720
No!

238
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,960
How did it feel to live as someone

239
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,600
who doesn't exist in the world?

240
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,640
I believe you can understand me better than you used to.

241
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,040
(Hanmin Nursing Hospital)

242
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,520
From now on, I'm going to kill the women in

243
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,400
the patients' room, one by one, every 30 minutes.

244
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
It was you.

245
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,800
You killed the people at Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

246
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,000
Ms. Hee-jeong!

247
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
Ms. Song Hee-jeong!

248
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,680
You told me you wouldn't kill them

249
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,120
if I came to see you.

250
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Don't try to escape from me anymore.

251
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,160
Come with me.

252
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,000
I can kill you right here,

253
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,120
but without you,

254
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,320
I'll lose my VIP client.

255
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
You must have enemies

256
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,600
to have allies.

257
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Please don't commit another murder because of me.

258
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
Do you think I caused that fire

259
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
at the apartments 11 years ago?

260
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,280
If you come here, I will tell you

261
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,760
the truth about that day.

262
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,080
The truth about that day?

263
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,800
What's the truth behind the apartment fire?

264
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,360
What is it? Tell me.

265
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,080
Why was Sung-mo there?

266
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,240
Why was Sung-mo at Hanmin Nursing Hospital?

267
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,000
How did you??

268
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
Did Sung-mo take Kang Eun-joo?

269
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,040
Why is Sung-mo in your memories?

270
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Lee Ahn!

271
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Answer me, Kang Geun-taek!

272
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,160
Kang Geun-taek!

273
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,400
You're under arrest for kidnapping, confinement

274
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
and attempted murder. You have the right to remain silent,

275
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,040
you have the right to testify in your favor in a court of law.

276
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,760
and you have the right to an attorney.

277
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,080
Answer me, Kang Geun-taek!

278
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Arrest him.

279
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,120
Don't think that Kang Sung-mo is your savior

280
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,680
just because he saved your life.

281
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,600
Kang Sung-mo just

282
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,920
tamed you.

283
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
What do you mean?

284
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,560
- Move out! - Kang Geun-taek!

285
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,000
Answer my question!

286
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,160
Kang Geun-taek!

287
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,520
Kang Geun-taek! I asked you what that meant!

288
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,000
Kang Geun-taek! Answer me!

289
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,080
Kang Geun-taek!

290
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,520
Let me go! Kang Geun-taek! Kang Geun-taek!

291
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,680
Lee Ahn, stop it! What's wrong with you?

292
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
You go to Detective Eun.

293
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,520
Prosecutor Kang went with her,

294
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
but things don't seem good.

295
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:59,400
(Operating Room)

296
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,840
Killing that bastard

297
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,560
won't heal your wound.

298
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,040
It'll only become a bigger wound.

299
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,120
So please??

300
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,080
Come back with me.

301
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,240
Kang Sung-mo.

302
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,160
I've come too far

303
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
to go back.

304
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,080
How's Ji-soo?

305
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,320
She's still in surgery.

306
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,640
Have you seen Sung-mo?

307
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,080
Prosecutor Kang?

308
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,720
Is Prosecutor Kang here?

309
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
Are you awake?

310
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,520
You need to rest.

311
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,160
Ms. Kang Eun-joo.

312
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Do??Do you know me?

313
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,120
Detective Kim, I think we need to treat his wound first.

314
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,680
We'll head to the station

315
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,360
after treating the suspect's injuries.

316
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Code Zero, Code Zero.

317
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,080
The car is driving into Bulseong Park. There are a lot of victims.

318
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,840
Requesting backup from all nearby units.

319
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,360
Another Code Zero?

320
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,560
What's going on today?

321
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,400
Patrol car No. 11, on the way.

322
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,760
Patrol car No. 22, on the way.

323
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,080
Not a moment's peace.

324
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,840
So Kang Eun-joo was declared dead after the fire

325
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,000
at Yeongseong Apartments, but she's alive,

326
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and this jerk, Kang Geun-taek who got caught after stabbing

327
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Detective Eun is the real culprit behind the Yeongseong case?

328
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,520
Yes, we need to do a further investigation,

329
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,560
but I think he's also behind the Hanmin Nursing Hospital fire

330
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,520
Wasn't the fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital

331
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,720
closed with the suspect's suicide?

332
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,160
I just don't know what's going on.

333
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,800
Kang Eun-joo had attempted to run

334
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,680
and had also attempted suicide,

00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960

during your investigation.

337
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,000
Please.

338
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,120

Damn it.

346
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,720
This is driving me nuts.

347
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320

Why are you so obsessed with life? That's unpleasant.

Okay then, I'll die before you do.

355

Yesterday at 3 p.m., on Basement Floor 3 at Kang Kook Station,

366
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,320
a man in his 50s stabbed an Officer Eun

367
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,120
with a deadly weapon and ran, but was eventually arrested.

368

But it has been revealed that he had escaped during transport.

369
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,200
There's a growing outcry of criticism

370
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
regarding the police's handling of the situation.

371
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
The victim was taken to a hospital

372
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,840
but did not make survive due to excessive bleeding.

373

The police are tracking down the suspect

by analyzing CCTV footage in addition to the investigation.

375
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,640
The victim has been identified as a lieutenant

376
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,960
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, and was attempting

377
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,840
to arrest the suspect, at the time of the incident.

378
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,920
Lieutenant Eun had a gun at the time of the incident,

379
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,040
and it has been reported that she fired

380

one blank ammunition and one live ammunition.

381
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,680
According to witness testimony,

382
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,960
the culprit was shot on his arm and was injured,

383
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,560
and he attacked the police once more when he fled the scene.

384
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,440
Turn that thing off. I don't want to hear it.

385

How dare you yell at me? You didn't do anything right!

386
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
You lost him when I practically handed him to you. How dare you!

387
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,160
This wouldn't have happened if you informed me

388

about that bastard being dangerous!

389
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Why did you have to involve me in a case like this?

390
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,480
Ugh, I should at least know something

391
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,000
to investigate or make excuses.

392
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,880
And why did It have to be Detective Eun Ji-soo that died?

Nevermind. I can't blame anybody.

From the confinement in Gangnyeong to Hanmin Nursing Hospital

With Yeongseong Apt. and Hanmin Nursing Hospital,

455
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,920
asked me to reopen them, many times.

456
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,080
I was the one who ignored you.

457

458

up to Eunam-dong Intersection,

469
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,880
but after that, we can't figure out where he went.

470
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,000
It'll be impossible to find him with CCTV.

471
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,040
It was like that when Officer Yoon was kidnapped, too.

472
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,160
Did Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo take Detective Eun to the hospital?

473
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,360
Yes, but no matter how many times

474
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,440
we call him for a testimony, he's not answering.

475
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,400
Where's Kang Eun-joo?

476
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,240
We're frustrated here as well.

477
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,640
She hasn't said a word since yesterday.

478
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,200
She pretended to be dead for the past 13 years.

479
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
She won't speak that easily.

480
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,480
Just wait. I have an idea.

481
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,760
It was Kang Eun-joo who gave the cube to Sung-mo.

482
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,480
And Sung-mo gave Kang Eun-joo the ring

483
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,080
she's been wearing this whole time.

484
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,080
That means Prosecutor Kang already knew

485
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,040
that Kang Eun-joo was alive.

486
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,240
Yes, it was Sung-mo who took

487
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
Kang Eun-joo out of Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

488
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,800
So that's why Kang Eun-joo

489
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,120
knew about Sae Ki Dong Station as well.

490
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,320
- What? - The only information

491
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,040
you saw about Kang Geun-taek in the basement

492
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,120
was about a place that doesn't exist,

493
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,040
but Kang Eun-joo went to Sae Ki Dong Station.

494
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,840
With a knife.

495
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,600
So Kang Eun-joo heard??

496
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,960
that Kang Geun-taek had something to do with Sae Ki Dong Station

497
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,240
from Sung-mo?

498
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,200
The Hanmin Nursing Hospital case was in 2016,

499
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,400
and Prosecutor Kang solved the Sae Ki Dong

500
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
panhandling case in 2015.

501
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,680
If those two have been

502
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,240
keeping in touch during this whole time,

503
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
it is possible.

504
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,800
The more I find out, the more I don't get it.

505
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,960
If Sung-mo had been keeping in touch with Kang Eun-joo,

506
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,600
why did he make a composite sketch of her?

507
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,280
Why did he make a plan for us to find her?

508
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,840
It doesn't make sense.

509
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,440
What's the truth behind the apartment fire?

510
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,640
What is it?

511
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,800
Why was Sung-mo at Hanmin Nursing Hospital?

512
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,320
Don't think that Kang Sung-mo is your savior

513
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,520
just because he saved your life.

514
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,640
Kang Sung-mo just tamed you.

515
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,640
Jae-in.

516
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,360
I think I need to meet Kang Eun-joo.

517
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,520
The only one who can tell us the truth right now

518
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,640
is Kang Eun-joo.

519
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,040
- Yes, Lieutenant Nam. - Let me ask you one thing.

520
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,800
How did you know that Kang Eun-joo would be at Sae Ki Dong Station?

521
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,040
And how did you know that Kang Geun-taek was at Kang Kook?

522
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,840
That's??

523
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,840
Kang Geun-taek and Kang Sung-mo disappeared into thin air,

524
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,520
and Kang Eun-joo won't talk, so the investigation can't progress.

525
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,200
Do you know anything more about this case?

526
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,080
You said that you wanted to solve your father's case

527
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,800
with your own hands, right?

528
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,720
Come join us. Right now.

529
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,440
There's one more person who needs to join, Lieutenant Nam.

530
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,600
Is it okay for people to find out

531
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,160
about your power?

532
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't care about that.

533
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,000
Hey, Officer Yoon.

534
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,080
What did I just hear? Huh?

535
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,320
Hey, Lee Ahn.

536
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,120
What? You read people's memories?

537
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,360
I know it's hard to believe,

538
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,960
but I was the one who saw Kim Gap-yong

539
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,920
murdering Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young,

540
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,160
and I found out that bastard was at Kang Kook Station,

541
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,000
all thanks to this power.

542
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,520
You lunatic.

543
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,760
Stop it with this nonsense.

544
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,120
We have no time. I have to meet Kang Eun-joo.

545
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,080
I have no time to joke around with you, either!

546
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,120
Officer Yoon, let's go.

547
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,880
You told Ji-soo about her father's corruption, right?

548
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,480
So you feel responsible

549
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,960
for this case right now.

550
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,280
- What? - I saw it when you

551
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,320
pulled Kang Geun-taek away from me.

552
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,200
I, too, feel the same way as you do, Lieutenant Nam.

553
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,880
Ji-soo went to Kang Kook Station

554
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,040
after listening to me, and got killed.

555
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
It's okay if you think I'm crazy,

556
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,120
or that I'm a freak,

557
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,920
but please,

558
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,880
please let me meet Kang Eun-joo.

559
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,360
Hey, you damn freak.

560
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,840
How can you read people's memories??

561
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,120
Do you believe he can, too?

562
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,800
Not only I but also Detective Eun and Prosecutor Kang knew.

563
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,160
That's why we investigated this case together.

564
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,800
You guys are all making a fool of me.

565
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,080
Hey, kid, how can you read memories by holding a hand?

566
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Officer Yoon, you go inside first.

567
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,040
Lieutenant Nam.

568
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,360
It's because even if you do see something from Kang Eun-joo

569
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,000
with that psychometry or whatever,

570
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,080
Kid, I am not 100% confident in your abilities, just yet.

571
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,440
Give me some time to think.

572
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,080
The top priority is to make Kang Eun-joo speak.

573
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,680
I'll go meet her first.

574
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,480
(Materials on Kim Gap-yong, Materials on Kang Eun-joo)

575
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,840
Do you remember me?

576
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,040
Uh??I went to that basement.

577
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,160
Where Prosecutor Kang and you had been locked up.

578
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,120
I know that it must've been hell.

579
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,400
And that the police were no help at all.

580
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,560
I'm sure you thought that it'd be all over

581
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,000
if you just escape from that place.

582
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,000
But, that incident is still

583
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,080
holding you and Prosecutor Kang captive, just like

584
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,000
how the chains held onto your ankles?

585
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,560
I'd like to apologize on everyone's behalf.

586
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,120
And I promise

587
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,560
that we will catch that man this time.

588
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,080
Is??

589
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,440
Is Sung-mo trying to kill him?

590
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,040
Yes.

591
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,040
Ms. Kang Eun-joo, you went to Sae Ki Dong Station

592
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,960
to kill Kang Geun-taek as well, right?

593
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,120
He's been following us even after

594
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,400
we escaped from that basement.

595
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,720
Just before we moved to Yeongseong Apartments,

596
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,640
Sung-mo was locked up by him again,

597
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,040
and then escaped, again.

598
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,040
And I'm sure the police said the same thing over and over again.

599
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,520
That they couldn't find a trace of him.

600
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,920
Yes.

601
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,000
I'm sure that you saw the news

602
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,920
about you dying in the Yeongseong Apartment fire.

603
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,520
Why didn't you come forward then?

604
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It was even scarier and more horrible

605
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,600
to tell them that I was alive.

606
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,320
No matter how many times we ran away,

607
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,880
he found us, no matter what.

608
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,720
Found you.

609
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,200
If the police couldn't find him

610
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,000
because he has no name and he was undocumented,

611
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,120
then I thought he wouldn't be able to find me

612
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
if I lived like that as well.

613
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,520
Have you seen Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo

614
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,440
since the Yeongseong Apartment incident?

615
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,800
No.

616
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
Sung-mo didn't know that I was alive, either.

617
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,120
I hated that Sung-mo was

618
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,720
in danger because of me,

619
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,280
so I didn't contact him.

620
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,200
That's a lie.

621
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,720
Kang Eun-joo was in contact with Sung-mo.

622
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,800
I'm sure of it.

623
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,120
And then you met Kang Geun-taek again

624
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,000
at Hanmin Nursing Hospital after 11 years?

625
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,320
I got a call from Ms. Song Hee-jeong

626
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,000
in the middle of that night.

627
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,320
(Song Hee-jeong)

628
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,480
Hello?

629
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,040
Ms. Song Hee-jeong.

630
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,560
Why did you call me at this hour? Is something wrong?

631
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,000
It's been a while.

632
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,880
Kang Eun-joo.

633
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,120
You didn't forget my voice, did you?

634
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,160
How did it feel to live as someone

635
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,080
who doesn't exist in the world?

636
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,600
I believe you can understand me better than you used to.

637
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,360
Looks like you don't even want to let me hear your voice.

638
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,880
But you know what?

639
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,440
I miss you so much

640
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,000
I'm about to go crazy.

641
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,440
From now on,

642
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,720
I'm going to kill the women in

643
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,400
the patients' room, one by one, every 30 minutes.

644
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,000
I'll kill them even if the police arrive.

645
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,440
If anyone else besides you come,

646
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,160
I'll kill that person, too.

647
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,080
Please.

648
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,840
Please don't do this.

649
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,720
Please don't commit another murder because of me.

650
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,040
He threatened to kill people again

651
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,000
just like how he did at Yeongseong Apt.

652
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,600
if I didn't come to see him.

653
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I was afraid of

654
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,440
more innocent people dying because of me.

655
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,840
So??

656
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,160
So I went to that place.

657
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,160
Is that a lie, too?

658
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,080
That's the truth.

659
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,800
But Kang Eun-joo is leaving out

660
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,760
something more important.

661
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Please don't commit another murder because of me.

662
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,800
"Again?"

663
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,680
Did you say "again?"

664
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,480
You truly know nothing.

665
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,040
Do you think I caused that fire

666
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,600
at the apartments 11 years ago?

667
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,120
If you come here, I will tell you

668
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,560
the truth about that day.

669
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,640
That he'd tell me the truth behind the Yeongseong Apt. fire.

670
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
It was in Kang Geun-taek's memories,

671
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,120
but why is she hiding it?

672
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,200
Do you know who Kim Gap-yong is?

673
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,320
Yes.

674
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,000
He made the identities for me.

675
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,720
Park Soo-young.

676
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,840
Kang Hee-sook.

677
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,080
And Kim Song-hee.

678
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,560
Did you know that Kim Gap-yong murdered

679
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,160
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young?

680
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Did you instigate the murders?

681
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,960
Did you want to tie up any loose ends

682
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,640
of your new identity?

683
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,280
No.

684
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,720
I never would've imagined that

685
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,040
he was killing people for my new identities.

686
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,360
You went to Hanmin Nursing Hospital with Kim Gap-yong?

687
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,160
I think it'd be dangerous if you go in alone.

688
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,520
I'll come with you??

689
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
He can

690
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,160
never kill me.

691
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,080
But he will try to take me

692
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,920
by any means necessary.

693
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,280
We have to stop the murder no matter what, so??

694
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,680
If I don't come out after 30 minutes,

695
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,040
then please call the police.

696
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,880
Ms. Hee-jeong.

697
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,800
Ms. Song Hee-jeong.

698
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,920
But when Kang Eun-joo arrived,

699
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,320
everyone was already dead.

700
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,680
Let go!

701
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,600
You have nowhere else to go to.

702
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,720
Don't try to escape from me anymore.

703
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,040
Please.

704
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,800
Come with me.

705
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,960
Kang Geun-taek drugged Kang Eun-joo,

706
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,520
and tried to kidnap her,

707
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,880
but then, Kim Gap-yong appeared.

708
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,640
That's all I remember about

709
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,840
Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

710
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,000
I have to go out for a while.

711
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,320
Please take care of this patient.

712
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,680
When I woke up, I was in Pureum Nursing Hospital,

713
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,360
and Kim Gap-yong gave me the new identity

714
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,680
of Kim Song-hee.

715
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,960
Are those all true?

716
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Yes, I saw Kim Gap-yong

717
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,280
saving Kang Eun-joo from Kang Geun-taek.

718
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,480
And the last one

719
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,080
to take Kang Eun-joo

720
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,160
was Sung-mo.

721
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,280
You mean Prosecutor Kang was at the scene of the Hanmin crime?

722
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,080
I am going to ask you one more time.

723
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,680
Are you sure you haven't seen Prosecutor Kang?

724
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,160
I haven't.

725
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,040
That mark on your finger.

726
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,560
It's a ring mark, right?

727
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,920
The one Prosecutor Kang gave you as a gift.

728
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,960
What are you talking about?

729
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,440
You left the ring on the island

730
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,080
after your suicide attempt, correct?

731
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,000
Was it because you didn't want

732
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,040
Prosecutor Kang to come find you again?

733
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,040
No.

734
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,520
I haven't seen my son since the Yeongseong Apt. incident.

735
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,760
Not even once.

736
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,560
That'll be all for today.

737
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,920
(Koo Yang National Hospital)

738
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,040
If you're trying to stab to kill

739
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,400
you shouldn't have stabbed here.

740
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,040
You should've stabbed here.

741
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,120
Stabbed here.

742
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,160
You told me you wouldn't kill them

743
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,040
if I came to see you.

744
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,640
I just did what Kang Sung-mo did.

745
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,000
Like my son.

746
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,520
Don't say that.

747
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,360
He is my child. He has nothing to do with you.

748
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,560
He's not a monster like you.

749
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,200
Yes, he has changed.

750
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,880
He was born as an emotionless child, like me,

751
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,000
but what made him human?

752
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,240
A mother's love?

753
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,760
If your effort made him human,

754
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,120
then I should've become human as well.

755
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,600
But I am still

756
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,960
an emotionless monster.

757
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,160
What are you trying to say?

758
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,680
The murder at Yeongseong Apartments.

759
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,200
I'm telling you that I didn't do it.

760
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,000
You even faked my corpse.

761
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,360
and you're saying that you didn't do it?

762
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,160
Yes.

763
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,080
I did fake your corpse.

764
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,000
Because that was the only way to take you.

765
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,880
But I didn't kill the others.

766
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,120
And I didn't start the fire, either.

767
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
I did plan to,

768
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,320
but someone else did it before I had a chance.

769
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,160
That's not possible.

770
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,440
Who else would do such a horrible thing?

771
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,880
If it wasn't you.

772
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,560
An emotionless child

773
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,480
like me

774
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,480
would've been able to do it, don't you think?

775
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,720
That's a lie.

776
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,240
That can't be.

777
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,920
Kang Geun-taek lied, right?

778
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,160
Right?

779
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,840
Tell me that Sung-mo didn't do it! Tell me!

780
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,080
(Pediatrics)

781
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,520
Did Sung-mo tell you about my power, too?

782
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,160
I told you.

783
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,040
I already figured out

784
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,320
all the places you could hide.

785
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,880
(He is Psychometric)

786
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,160
If your effort made him human,

787
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,200
then I should've become human as well.

788
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,680
Ji-soo!

789
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,320
It feels like Prosecutor Kang

790
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,840
keeps dragging us into past cases.

791
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,160
"That person" mentioned by Kim Gap-yong is??

792
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,160
Ahn, I found a trace of Prosecutor Kang.

793
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,120
If you don't look into it properly,

794
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,000
you'll make the same mistake again.

795
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,120
Isn't it the time for you to do

796
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,360
something for Sung-mo, Ms. Kang Eun-joo?

797
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,240
I'm sorry I'm late.

798
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,920
I'm going to go back now.
