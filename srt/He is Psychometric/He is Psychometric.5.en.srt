00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
(Dec. 3, 2005, 6:20 PM)

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
Love.

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,040
A warm feeling of treasuring and caring.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,520
Obsess.

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
Verb.

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,080
Being drawn into something and clinging onto it.

9
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
Sung-mo.

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,040
Oh, no. It must be that person.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,240
Unit 701. Unit 701. Are you home?

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,120
- You saw her going in, right? - Yes, she is home for sure.

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
She is home.

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,200
This is the President of Women's Society. We need to talk.

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,880
Huh? Unit 701. Open the door.

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Oh.

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,520
- It's opened. - What is this?

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Uh??I have something to tell your mom.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,000
Is your mom home?

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
You can tell me what it's about.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Uh, the security guard keeps putting these up.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,080
Have you read it by any chance?

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,120
No.

24
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Your mom didn't join the Women's Society yet, right?

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,320
We have a meeting at my house today. Can you tell her to come?

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,480
Okay.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,160
Uh, okay. Bye.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,080
- What? Did he lock it? - Yes.

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,320
Anyway, he is peculiar and weird.

30
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,360
They moved here more than a month ago, but they never say hi.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,160
- I know, right? - So ridiculous.

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,640
His mom looks really gloomy, too.

33
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,520
Found them.

34

(Seoheun Police Station)

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
I decided to check three, four or five times

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,000
when the suspect says that he or she isn't the culprit.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,160
If I become a cop, I can prevent

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
others from having to suffer like my dad

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,080
and me, ever again.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,160
Even if I don't clear my dad's false charges,

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
that would be worthwhile enough.

48
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,080
So you finally started to think of your own life?

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Regardless of your dad.

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,960
- Sung-mo. - Long time no see.

51
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Officer Yoon Jae-in.

52

Daddy-Long-Legs.

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,920
Daddy??what?

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,080
Wow, what kind of coincidence is this?

55
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,000
So, you supported her? For three years?

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,120
Yes, the recommendation was from the Father at the orphanage.

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,600
So I told her to move to the house next door to ours.

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
And I recommended her to transfer to your school.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm so sorry about that time.

60
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,920
I promised to repay you,

61
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,720
and then I disappeared. You must've been upset.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,080
Ah, don't worry about it.

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
I believe that the things that are bound to happen

64
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,040
will happen even if you try to avoid it,

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
and those who are bound to meet will meet.

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
- Since when? - Since I watched

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,320
"Comrades: Almost A Love Story."

68
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,440
So it'd be better to think about how to deal with them

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
rather than avoiding the things to happen and people to meet.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
- Huh? - That's a really difficult way

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,120
to tell her not to run away suddenly anymore.

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,760
Ah, please tell me your phone number.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,720
My aunt really wants to treat you to a meal.

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,080
Yes, sure??If I say it's okay, then you'll feel indebted forever.

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,320
Do you know my number?

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
Sung-mo, write down mine under yours.

77
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
Anyway, I'm here to take him.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
If not, he'll spend the whole night at the stream.

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
Right. He was about to do that.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,440
Make sure to call me.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
Ah??Actually, I have a favor to ask you.

82
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,080
A favor? From me?

83
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,960
But I'm busy today, so I'll tell you later.

84
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
What is it?

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,640
You said you'll repay me, so don't refuse.

86
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
- Okay. - Okay then.

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
What the heck?

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,440
Oh, come on. What is it? What is this favor?

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,360
Do you want to know? Okay, then.

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
Ah??

91
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,840
Ugh, I don't know. Ah, I can't see anything. Damn it.

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
Hey, let's not do this here.

93
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,640
What? Ahn? Ahn?

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
Ahn! Ahn! Hey.

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Hey!

96
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,600
Looks like??there's a misunderstanding, right?

97
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Ugh, come on, tell me!

98
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
Ugh, damn it.

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Did you think about what favor Sung-mo was trying to ask you?

100
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,120
With my brain, I don't know what he's thinking of.

101
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,880
No, that excuse is way too awkward.

102
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,120
Hey, where are you going?

103
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,760
There's a big disaster.

104
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,480
What? Damn it.

105
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
See? Look at this.

106
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,520
You just scratched my car with your car door.

107
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,040
This is the only car that's been parked next to mine, huh?

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,000
How dare you make an excuse? Huh?

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Did you just hit me?

110
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
- Go ahead, hit me more! - Please calm down and talk.

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,160
- You're framing me. - Framing?

112
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,360
Framing?

113
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
- Are you okay? - How dare you??

114
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,800
Ladies, this is police assault.

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
What do you mean, assault?

116
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm doing this because of that! Just look at that!

117
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
- The disaster is a scratch? - It costs a fortune to fix!

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,640
- Ugh, stop, stop! - How old are you?

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,040
Fighting like this won't solve anything.

120
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,440
I will go find either a witness or evidence,

121
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
so please calm down and wait.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
How can you catch the culprit, young lady?

123
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,960
I can totally tell that you're a rookie.

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,080
How dare you speak like that to a police officer?

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,200
How dare you talk down to everyone?

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
You little??

127
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
You come here, huh?

128
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,800
- How dare you? - Do you know who I am?

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,920
What if I do? Huh?

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
You rude little crap.

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
How dare you!

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,160
How dare you talk down? How dare you?

133
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,440
- Come here. - No, I won't!

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
Do you know who I am?

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,400
The car next to it didn't scratch it.

136
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,400
The scratch is a recent one,

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,680
but it isn't from a car door.

138
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
It must be from something rougher.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,560
For example??

140
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,360
- Like a rock? - Yes, that's right.

141
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,080
Huh? Where did you find that?

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,520
Did you see who the culprit is?

143
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,520
Hey, lady, one hangover soup. Hurry.

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,240
Hey, lady, don't you have any more kimchi?

145
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
- Take this with you. - Oh, no.

146
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,080
Can't you do things right?

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

148
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,720
It's on my shoes, too.

149
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,040
I know that you were angry,

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,080
but breaking other people's belongings

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,520
will make your mom suffer, though you tried to protect her.

152
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,720
I thought about keeping it as a secret,

153
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,240
because that lady is just so horrible.

154
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
But if I keep it as a secret,

155
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,040
this memory will stay in your memories

156
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
and haunt you forever.

157
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
Do you want to make such a bad secret to keep from your mom?

158
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Right?

159
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,560
You're tearing up again.

160
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,040
Tell her that you're sorry. Now.

161
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

162
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,080
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,320
How on earth are you disciplining your kid?

164
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,240
How dare you scratch my car with a stone?

165
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll pay for the repair.

166
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
Please call me.

167
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,520
Don't change your mind later on.

168
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,160
This is just disgusting. Damn it.

169
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,640
Lady.

170
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
Won't you apologize to me?

171
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,120
You falsely accused me of being a criminal. And what's this?

172
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
Who told you to park your car next to mine?

173
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,280
You see, ma'am,

174
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,040
don't come to my restaurant anymore.

175
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
I will discipline my daughter

176
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,280
and make sure I won't let her become someone like you,

177
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,280
so I wish that you won't

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
come to my restaurant ever again.

179
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
This is ridiculous.

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,480
There are horrible people like her everywhere.

181
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,000
If it wasn't for you, I would've punched that witch.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,120
Thank you.

183
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

184
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Ah??What is this feeling?

186
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Revealing the truth doesn't always mean justice prevails.

187
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,120
Justice didn't prevail,

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,560
but you proved your power for sure.

189
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
I didn't prove it.

190
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,920
I do this kind of beginner level psychometry from time to time.

191
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,120
I just don't try to do it that much.

192
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,080
You're the one who solved it,

193
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,000
but I was the one who was thanked.

194
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,640
By the way, is something wrong?

195
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,360
You don't look so happy today.

196
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,200
It's one of those unhappy days. Everyone has them.

197
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,800
Unhappy days??

198
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,840
Yes, we do have those.

200
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,920
Ugh! That hurts.

201
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,000
You keep avoiding touching things by instinct,

202
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,280
so your power isn't improving.

203
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,640
Who said that it isn't improving?

204
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,360
Even if you hate performing psychometry on random things,

205
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
if you are going to conduct an investigation with that,

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
don't avoid touching things.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
I don't avoid it.

208
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,160
This is just a habit.

209
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Touching only the things related to investigations

210
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,200
is like trying to peek at answers without studying for exams.

211
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,440
Do you understand what I'm saying?

212
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
Okay. I will practice.

213
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
I will.

214
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,320
I changed the passcode in the morning.

215
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,720
How childish.

216
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,680
Wow??

217
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,640
I only need three seconds to figure it out.

218
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
Only six digits?

219
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,080
051203. Good grief.

220

You see, it's about numbers, huh?

221
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,040
If you change them frequently, then you can't remember them.

222
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
It's a date.

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,160

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
my birthday??

225
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,600
Do you like this one?

226
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,080
Yes! You're the best, Dad!

Jae-in.

235
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,960
Jae-in, what's wrong?

236
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,720
You've been alright recently.

237
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,480
So today is that day.

238
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't think Dad did it,

239
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,280
but why does

240
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,040
my heart break every year on this day, Auntie?

241
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,080
Ta-da! Here's a puppy!

242
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,960
Woof, woof.

243
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,440
Woof, woof.

244
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,040
Woof, woof, woof.

245
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,840
But I'm sure the families of those who died on that day

246
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
must be suffering way more than I am suffering today.

247
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,480
My dad will be resented by them forever, right?

248
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,440
It's not your fault.

249
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,880
It isn't, Jae-in.

250
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Poor thing.

251
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,080
Ahn, Dad will do everything for you, except for the puppy.

252

Why are you taking that?

253

- Go. - Mom. Dad.

Just why not?

260
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,920
Why are you freaking out today?

261
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,120
Because she has to get married if she can't catch the culprit.

Shut up!

263
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
You said yesterday that you might be able to identify them.

264
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,920
Why can't you identify them all the sudden?

265
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,960
They looked okay to the naked eye,

266
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,280
but the dermal fingerprints are badly damaged.

267
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,120
I recovered a few of the partial ones and scanned them,

268
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,160
but I couldn't find a match.

269

Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

270

Since this body was in the water for a long time,

274
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,920
I might try the high-temperature wet heat method.

Ah, "repay."

332
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
(Never forget, repay him)

333
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,240
Ah??I memorized it on my way to say it here.

334
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,880
Your mother and father are waiting for a long time.

335
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
Well, we understand each other

336
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,160
without even saying anything.

337
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,000
I touched the items my parents left me,

338
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
and I could hardly do any psychometry.

339
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm sure the memories left in the items are fading away.

340
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah.

341
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,200
If I get to be able to control my power all by myself,

342
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,000
will I be able to keep on reading my mom and dad's memories?

343
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,600
You will.

344
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,480
Because I will make you do it.

345
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,120
Korea's first psychometrist?

346
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,720
If that day comes, I??

347
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,800
Nothing. It's nothing.

348
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,320
You should stop coming to the autopsy room.

349
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,040
- You should give up. - Are you as frustrated as I am?

350
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,200
This isn't like school grades I can study for. I'm going nuts.

351
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Isn't it because you lack effort and desperation?

352
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,240
Why don't you go to Noryangjin and say that again?

353
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,800
Go on, say it.

354
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Uh, Ahn.

355
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
About Prosecutor Kang.

356
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,160
What about Sung-mo?

357
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,560
I think Prosecutor Kang

358
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,360
wants to ask you for help, for some reason.

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,000
Sung-mo wants to ask??me?

360
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,920
Yeah. I'm not sure about the details, but I think so.

361
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,040
He's the only person whom your psychometry doesn't work on,

362
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,520
and that might mean that he totally shut down his heart.

363
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
And I'm sure he's been lonely as much, too.

364
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,120
There must be a reason for that as well.

365
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,760
I'm sure you weren't the only one

366
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,880
who felt he was alone in this world.

367
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,400
What are you doing?

368
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,040
Aren't you coming?

369
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,120
Wait for me.

370
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,360
Wherever you go,

371
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,760
I'll go with you, no matter what.

372
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,800
Why are you making it sound so grand?

373
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,320
We're just going to see Officer Yoon.

374
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,520
Why are you going to see her?

375
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,080
Huh? Are you about to reveal the favor you will ask her?

376
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,680
Didn't you hear me?

377
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In other words,

378
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,440
I want you to improve Ahn's power of psychometry,

379
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
Officer Yoon.

380
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,760
You do know about his power.

381
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,080
How??How did you know that?

382
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Who's there?

383
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,000
Damn it.

384
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,760
Yoon Jae-in?

385
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,800
Why are you there?

386
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,040
Because this is my house.

387
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,160
I didn't hear it because I wanted to hear it.

388
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,640
Did??Did you hear everything?

389
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,160
Until??

390
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,480
Until you said??

391
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll go to you!

392
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,520
"I'll go to you!"

393
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,120
Especially the part you said "shaking hands, or anything" was??

394
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,760
Ah, stop.

395
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,000
I could feel the desperation from that part.

396
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,680
Wait. Let's just say that you did hear it.

397
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,200
But why are you telling her to improve my power?

398
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,080
Ah??

399
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,160
You can say no if you want to.

400
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,120
But I really want you,

401
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,800
Officer Yoon, to do this. Not someone else.

402
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,560
Could you please give me some time to think about it?

403
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,560
I need some time to think about it, too.

404
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,000
You shouldn't think. That's for me and Officer Yoon to do.

405
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
If you help us with this,

406
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,880
I might be able to help you with

407
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,960
your official transfer to a criminal team.

408
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
Where have you been?

409
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,440
You look tired.

410
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
I got a call from the Agency about the luggage case.

411
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
What did they say?

412
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
They told us to remove the police line.

413
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
Ah??Okay.

414
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,560
That was a difficult battle. Wow, nice.

415
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,760
- Oh, hi, ma'am. - hi.

416
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,720
- Jae-in, time for lunch. - Okay.

417
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,680
You're wearing something striking today.

418
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,960
It's called at-home fashion.

419
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,520
There wasn't an activity class this morning, right?

420
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,080
No, because the old ladies there are going on a group picnic.

421
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,360
By the way, how did you know?

422
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,680
Old soldiers never die. They never fade away, either.

423
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
It's a hunch of an expert investigator.

424
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,480
It's a three-layer lunch box.

425
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,560
You put your soul into lunch boxes on days without morning class,

426
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,520
so he knows.

427
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,680
Officer Yoon, you're learning and growing.

428
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,120
I thought I might've spilled some amazing clue or something.

429
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,520
Please join us.

430
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,120
May I?

431
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,600
I'll go wash my hands.

432
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,560
Ah, right, please keep this??

433
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,600
What is this??Is this hair?

434
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,840
It's a part of me.

435
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,440
Ugh, come on!

436
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Why does he do that?

437
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,880
Ugh, so disgusting.

438
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,040
Hey, isn't Lieutenant Nam married?

439
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
He's a goose father.

440
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,440
His wife and son are in Canada.

441
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,160
His son graduates from college when he retires,

442
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
so he's waiting for that day.

443
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Ugh, men always become pathetic without their wives.

444
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,120
Why is he counting the layers of someone else's lunch box?

445
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,040
And why did he give me that disgusting nose hair of his?

446
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,200
- Ugh, so gross. - Come on, Auntie.

447
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,760
Hey, think about it.

448
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,640
I was thankful that he let us live here,

449
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
so I asked him to eat with us out of politeness,

450
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,080
but now, he joins us like it's natural.

451
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,920
I wonder if I'm joining you like it's natural.

452
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,560
I will make sure to use my own cutlery.

453
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,720
Wow, it gets better and better.

454
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,600
Go ahead, Jae-in.

455
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,920
Ah, did you hear the news, Officer Yoon?

456
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,120
What news?

457
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,560
One of your colleagues arrested a robber and a murder suspect,

458
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,120
so he became an official cop and will be specially promoted.

459
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,080
Ah, yes, I heard it, too.

460
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,680
How is that possible?

461
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,480
His junior cop term isn't even over yet.

462
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,280
That patrol division deals with lots of cases.

463
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,640
He must've been lucky.

464
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,840
Officer Yoon is luckier than he is.

465
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,840
If he goes to a criminal team, he has to chase them with knives.

466
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,520
This place is much better than that.

467
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,760
No cases, definitive work hours, and no overnight shifts.

468
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,040
Yes, I worked hard in the past, but it's all useless.

469
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,280
Why are you poking me?

470
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
Uh, you need to eat some meat.

471
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,760
You look like you have no energy these days.

472
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,480
Say ah. Eat some meat.

473
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,760
(Do not enter)

474
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,800
Finding the body isn't enough.

475
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,200
I don't know what to do with it.

476
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,400
I want you to improve Ahn's power of psychometry,

477
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,120
Officer Yoon.

478
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,760
Why did he ask Yoon Jae-in to do that?

479
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,320
Your power can see the person who's holding a knife,

480
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,720
but it can't see whom that person stabbed,

481
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,040
or if that person is holding a knife

482
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,000
to cover up someone's sin.

483
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,640
Don't be arrogant about seeing

484
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,800
a few out of thousands of pieces.

485
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,040
So, if I see the puzzle pieces,

486
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,760
Yoon Jae-in will solve the puzzle with them?

487
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,800
(National Police Agency)

488
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,080
(Special Promotion Ceremony for Junior Officer Shim Sin-il)

489
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,200
Alright, please look here. We'll take a photo.

490
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,880
Look here. One, two.

491
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,760
Look here too, please.

492
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,200
Yes, please scoot over to this side.

493
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,520
Stay right there. Good.

Oh, Yoon Jae-in.

496
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,720
Ah, congratulations.

497
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,280
- Oh, come on. - Congratulations.

498
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,560
The one with the highest promotion points among you guys

499
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,920
should be promoted soon, too.

500
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,640
Ugh, seriously.

501
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,000
I feel sorry for being specially promoted all by myself.

502
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,080
Anyway, congratulations.

503
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
Alright, time for a photo.

504
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,040
Look here, please and smile.

505
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,080
One, two, three.

506
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
Special promotion.

507
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
A special promotion to a criminal team??

508
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,080
Hi.

509
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
So much for promotion points.

510
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,640
How can I wish for a case to occur for a promotion?

511
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,080
Ha, and what's so important about the points?

- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

Goodbye.

522
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
- How many? - Like 10?

Ye-eun.

525
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,280
Happy birthday to you.

526
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,840
I'm going crazy.

527
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
I'm counting points by looking at people.

528
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,800
How can I call myself a cop? Ugh??

529
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,520
50 points for murder.

530
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,280
70 points for murder and robbery.

531
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,160
Did you think about what Sung-mo said?

532
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm still thinking.

533
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,920
I'm done thinking about it.

534
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
I'd like you to do it.

535
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,320
Even if I do, I don't know how to do it??

536
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,400
Well, you'll have to do "everything," like you said.

537
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,160
But even if you don't know how to do it,

538
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm sure there's a reason for you to do it.

539
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,120
A reason for me to do it?

540
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,880
I met you a long time ago, before two years ago.

541
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Me?

542
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,360
Your shoelace is untied again.

543
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,080
I can't let you trip and fall.

544
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,320
Not long after I got this power,

545
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,720
I did psychometry on you.

546
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,160
I didn't even know the name for my power at that time, but??

(Gwangcheon Police Station)

548
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,000
Then can you please tell him to release my dad?

549
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,040
My dad isn't a bad guy. He really isn't.

550
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,640
For some reason, my memories about you

551
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,600
from that day did not fade away for a long time.

552
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,440
When I think of it now,

553
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,120
perhaps I thought that my weird power

554
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,640
could be used to help someone else for the first time then.

555
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,120
I met you on that day?

556
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,800
And you gave me candy?

557
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,960
- Don't you remember? - Not at all.

558
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,200
You forgot about it, but to me,

559
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,080
you were the first client who asked me to solve a case.

560
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,080
First??client?

561
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,800
So let's do it, together.

562
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,800
If I hold this hand of yours,

563
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,040
how many of my secrets will you get to find out?

564
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Uh??

565
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,040
I don't know about that.

566
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,160
Human memories are like

567
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,120
mixed up pills in one container.

568
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,600
You can't tell if it's poison or an antidote

569
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,200
until I actually have a taste of it.

570
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,320
Well, it doesn't require me to touch you to improve it.

571
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,920
I just haven't decided whether to do it or not.

572
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,840
I'm not trying to avoid you touching me.

573
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,520
Okay, let's keep it that way, then.

574
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,400
But even if I have a million reasons to do it,

575
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,560
I just don't know how to help you improve.

576
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
And I don't know why Prosecutor Kang chose me, either.

577
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,520
If you were me, what kind of investigation would you do?

578
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,880
Think about that.

579
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,040
I will do all of the actions.

580
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
What? Are you leaving again?

581
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm late. Detective Eun is waiting.

582

Ji-soo is?

583
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,160
No way.

584
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,120
Are you in charge of that luggage case?

585
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,280
- Ah - Victim's been identified, right?

586
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,320
Tell me. Tell me right now.

587
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Ugh, let go.

588
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
Won't you tell me?

589
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,920
Uh??

590
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,600
Uh??You see??

591
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Uh??

592
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Uh, I think she'll be identified soon.

593
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,800
Which means I have no time to play with you.

No. I found this body,

00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,600
so let's cling onto him, no matter what.

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,600
Um??

661
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
Ahn?

662
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,840
Is it Lee Ahn?

663
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,760
That's not it. It's??

664
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,120
Are you done for the day?

665
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,560
Yes, I got out of work on time.

666
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,720
Nothing's wrong today, again.

667
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,520
Good for you.

668
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
A mother is never out of work.

669
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,280
When I leave work, I go home and do housework.

670
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,520
How about we go upstairs and have some beer?

671
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,760
I'd love to, but??

672
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,720
Hey, you deserve to do so.

673
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,240
And I can have fun with that as an excuse.

674
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,120
- Let's go. - But I shouldn't??

675
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,520
Let's go.

676
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,080
Are you awake?

677
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,800
Luckily, your organs weren't damaged,

678
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,640
so the surgery was finished quickly.

679
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,200
Your guardians said they will return soon,

680
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
so go on and rest.

681
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,880
Okay.

682
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,680
Nice. Wow, this is nice.

683
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,160
- It's going down smoothly. - Nice, nice.

684
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,720
- Hey. - Shh.

685
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,160
Drink it. You said you wanted to have fun.

686
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,120
A police station is like open for 24 hours, so drinking is a??

687
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,400
Hey, that's enough. Let's drink on our own. Ugh.

688
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,600
Wow, wow. This is nice.

689
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,840
This room is full of female energy. I like it.

690
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,240
It's bursting with female energy. Go on and drink.

691
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,000
Thanks a lot, ma'am.

692
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,200
Yes, if you can't find a babysitter for Eun-sol,

693
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,720
then let me look after her, okay?

694
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,600
- Okay. - Take her home, Officer Yoon.

695
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,000
- I'll be back. - Okay.

696
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,040
Hey, be careful.

697
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,920
- You're really drunk. - Wow.

698
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,920
Bye.

699
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,760
Oh, she's asleep already.

700
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,080
(Ice detected on surface, take caution while driving)

701
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,960
Oh, she has coupons.

702
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,000
(Dae-bong)

703
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You raced downtown with my car?

704
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,720
Have you gone nuts for real?

705
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,320
Hey, I was the one who got damaged.

706
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,040
Your car is completely fine.

707
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,000
Ugh, enough. We're not friends anymore.

708
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm not kidding. Bring my car back, and don't call me.

709
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,560
Dae-bong, I'm hungry.

710
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,080
Get me some food, will you?

711
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,000
You're hungry? What do you want?

712
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,160
Tteokbokki? Dumplings? What? Where's the hospital at?

713
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,120
I want soondae.

714
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,160
What the heck? He hung up.

715
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,040
Ugh, this isn't it.

716
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,040
Wow, it is your gas station.

717
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,920
Uh??Long time no see.

718
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,160
- Here. - Okay.

719
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,200
I have so many questions for you.

720
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,840
Please hurry.

721
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,360
Sung-mo.

722
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,760
The victim has been identified?

723
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,160
Where's the convenience store at?

724
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
It's on B2.

725
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,080
Thank you.

726
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,120
What did you just say?

727
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,840
The body in the luggage belonged to whom?

728
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,480
Remember?

729
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,840
Kang Hee-sook.

730
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,720
You mean that caretaker who went missing two years ago

731
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,400
during the fire at the nursing hospital?

732
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,120
Yes, that woman with a ring,

733
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,280
whom Ahn saw through psychometry.

734
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,080
I saw a woman.

735
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,120
A woman wearing a ring.

736
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,040
But she's not wearing a ring.

737
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,320
The ring isn't the only thing that's suspicious about this.

738
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,000
Like what?

739
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,320
It just doesn't make any sense, no matter how many times

740
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,600
I go over it. It makes no sense that she was alive two years ago.

741
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,760
This body must've been dead for at least four to five years.

742
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,320
But you can't confirm the time of death for

743
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,120
bodies recovered from water.

744
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,520
Right.

745
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,360
But we have one more body.

746
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,400
My opinion is that the time of murder, murder method,

747
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,280
and the time of abandonment are the same with

748
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,120
the body of Park Soo-young, who was found before this.

749
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,920
No way. There's a record of her

750
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,000
working at Hanmin Nursing Hospital two years ago.

751
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,280
That bothered me, so I checked again and again.

752
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,600
The time of death is definitely before the fire at Hanmin.

753
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,080
If her fingerprints have been identified,

754
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,520
then it is certain that she is the real Kang Hee-sook.

755
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,880
If so, we need to find out who this other Kang Hee-sook

756
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,360
at Hanmin Nursing Hospital really was.

757
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,080
Ugh, I can understand with Sung-mo,

758
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,120
but why isn't this jerk Dae-bong coming?

759
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,880
Who are you?

760
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
How dare you stalk my "brother??

761
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,120
Just who was it?

762
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,840
(Lee Ahn)

763
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:01,080
(Authorized Personnel Only)

764
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,040
(Lee Ahn)

765
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,280
You jerk, why are you so late?

766
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,920
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

767
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,600
(He is Psychometric)

768
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,000
I will re-investigate everything from the beginning.

769
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,040
Go.

770
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,520
Was that person here?

771
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,720
Perhaps it won't end until I die.

772
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,040
Officer Yoon Jae-in's father is

773
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,360
Yoon Tae-ha, the culprit behind the fire at Yeongseong Apartments.

774
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,000
Is this what "pretty" is?

775
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,440
- It was him. I'm sure. - Kim Gap-yong?

776
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,080
He killed Kang Hee-sook.

777
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,440
I'll ask you one question. Just how much do I have to do

778
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,160
to improve his power of psychometry?

779
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,440
Until he's able to perform psychometry on me.

780
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,240
- Lee Ahn! - What's wrong? Wake up!

781
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,080
- Lee Ahn! - Wake up, Lee Ahn!
