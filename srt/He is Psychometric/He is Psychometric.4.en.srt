00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,840
(One hour before the fire at Yeongseong Apartments)

6
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Jae-in.

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,760
I'll go hand out the flyers, so wait here.

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,200
Okay, but please hurry.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,640
Ugh, what now?

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, Mister. I told you about a thousand times.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,760
You should not pass these out without consulting the residents.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,960
I've been telling the residents not to park in the fire lane,

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,520
but no one has been cooperating.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,360
Hey, are you advertising about our apartments

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,960
having a crappy parking lot?

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,040
We're not paying your salary by collecting maintenance fee

17
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,840
every month for you to use your energy on

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,720
making the price of this place drop.

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm trying to make my salary worth something.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,880
I've been checking the firefighting facilities

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
and did everything I could.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,080
The firefighting system is a total mess??

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,040
Me??Mess?

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,000
What??Who said that it's a mess?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ma'am, I know that you can receive

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,520
some bribe from here and there,

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
and you receive profit, too. But you shouldn't do this

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
to the things that are related to the lives of the residents.

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,560
Wait, wait, what? What did you say?

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,080
Bribe?

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Oh, wow, this is driving me nuts.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,160
You're nuts.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,080
No, no, I'm nuts. I am.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,000
I was nuts to recommend you saying that

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,920
you're a former firefighter and you're trustworthy!

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,040
- That's not what I meant. - Mister.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,000
You're fired as of today!

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
What?

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,800
Ugh, seriously, what is this?

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,120
Isn't this a sacred workplace, Mister?

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
How can you bring your kid to your workplace?

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,200
My daughter came to take me home because I'm about to go home.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
Enough.

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,720
You're fired right now, with the added reason of neglect of duty.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,920
What a garbage!

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,960
(Please keep the fire lane clear. It is the lane of life)

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,760
Don't mind her.

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,040
You just did what you had to do,

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
and she is the one who's weird.

50
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,040
By the way, what should I do?

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,920
Isn't it obvious?

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,640
You just need to get a new job.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,760
No, not that.

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,000
What if these apartments are on fire?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
Ugh, that'd be so dangerous.

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,520
My daughter, your shoelace is untied again.

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
I can't let you trip and fall.

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,080
- Go inside. - Okay.

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
- Dad! - Jae-in!

68
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
I'll be out soon, so don't worry!

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,720
- Okay! - Okay, okay!

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Come out, now.

Ah, you see, uh??My hands are numb.

78

Taking the exam with other methods besides taking it for yourself

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,240
are all considered cheating,

(Written Examination Room)

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
Alright, hand off from the test sheet.

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Let's go outside and talk.

86
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm not running away anymore.

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,160
Why are you calling me so much on a day off?

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
What is it? An undercover investigation?

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,080
Ah, it was a blind date.

90
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,920
I dumped him in 10 minutes and left.

91
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,840
Ah, right.

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,000
I just remembered that I have to go see Prosecutor Kang.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
- Want to go with me? - Why should I?

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,080
So you can show Prosecutor Kang that I dressed up today?

95
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
Did you notice?

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
Well, that'd be too easy to see, right?

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Just popping out of nowhere like that?

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Totally. Completely.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,760
I showed my intention already.

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,240
No way??

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Did you go see Prosecutor Kang already?

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,000
He comes to work every weekend. Since two years ago.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Ah, right.

104
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,120
He's still clinging onto that case, huh?

105
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,440
It already ended as having no right of indictment

106
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,480
because the assailant is deceased. And what is this?

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,800
The only witness who pointed out the assailant was murdered.

108
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,840
It's just a simple robbery. Don't try to make connections.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,040
And a caretaker disappeared from the fire scene.

110
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
My pride as a cop won't allow

111
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,160
to cover this up like this.

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
What about my pride, then?

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,120
What about me, your father's pride, who's been a cop all my life?

114
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,800
We did public briefing about the nursing hospital case,

115
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,120
and I know that you solved the Yeongseong Apartments case

116
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,160
11 years ago, Commissioner.

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Yes, I'm sure you know better than the others, Prosecutor Kang.

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,560
You saw that case close up, and you even participated in

119
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
your mother's autopsy at a young age.

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
Did you think that my investigation was incomplete?

121
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,000
Commissioner, do you really think

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,320
you can swear to God that you're complete and perfect?

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
- Prosecutor Kang. - Just like the fire at

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,120
the nursing hospital,

125
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,080
I do recall the Yeongseong Apt. case being closed quite quickly.

126
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,360
I did everything correctly, according to the law, procedure,

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,280
- and evidence. - Dad.

128
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,080
If you want an official re-investigation,

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,040
bring solid evidence or the real culprit, instead of assumptions.

130
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,400
The prosecution is fiercely against it as well,

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
so doing this to me won't make any difference.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Alright.

133
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
I'll take that as you saying that an unofficial one is okay,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
and I will leave for today.

135
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,160
Prosecutor Kang's mother

136
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,120
wasn't one of the victims who died of fire,

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,800
but was one of those who were stabbed with a knife.

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,680
Wow??So that's why he was so obsessed with it.

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,280
Ugh, there's something bothersome but he won't tell me,

140
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,040
and it doesn't seem like the investigation is progressing, either.

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,920
You know, he is actually never friendly to anybody.

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,120
Except for that psycho kid.

143
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Ugh, he's not a psycho kid. He does psychometry.

144
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,200
Anyway, if there's a real culprit like Prosecutor Kang said,

145
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm sure that this one isn't an ordinary one.

146
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Because he or she didn't leave any evidence.

147
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
(Identity of the Victim /Kim Gap-yong, Insurance Planner)

148
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,160
To be honest, I felt guilty and sorry about escaping alone,

149
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,920
so I couldn't report it sooner. I'm so sorry.

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,040
It seems that he was attacked on his way to meet us.

151
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,720

I'll go rescue your mom and dad.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Please look after this child.

155
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Isn't this chain weird?

156
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,160
It wasn't used to tie his legs onto something,

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,240
and it doesn't seem like it was for tying his feet, either.

(Murder of Kim Gap-yong by robbery)

159
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
Long time no see.

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
I didn't expect you to become a cop.

161
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
How have you been?

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
There's no way she'd shake my hand.

163
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,680
No, no.

164
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,280
This can't be.

165
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,840
Jae-in, you did so well today. See you next time. Bye.

166
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,040
I need something to protect me. I need at least one thing.

167
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,080
I have neither parents nor someone to watch my back.

168
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,960
I held on with the title of the top student at school,

169
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,240
but if people find out that I'm a beggar-like girl who lives??

170
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
on a rooftop,

171
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,400
then I lose all of my defensive powers.

172
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,560
I can't even stand still.

173
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,200
I will reveal your true self to the entire world, got it?

174
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,520
Are you okay? Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

175
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm okay.

176
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,640
You can't run away forever.

177
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Aren't you tired?

178
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I am tired.

179
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,720
I'm tired to death.

180
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
I'll help you.

181
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
When you're ready.

182
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Lee Ahn.

183
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
I wanted to tell you.

184
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,360
That your words about helping me

185
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,080
gave me strength, even for a moment.

186
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Make your power great and awesome!

187
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,320
Hey, Yoon Jae-in!

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,160
If you do, when I'm confident,

189
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,760
I will go look for you.

190
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,800
You were trying to cheat earlier, right?

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
Those people have been studying in a small room without windows

192
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
for years, with their butts covered in rash.

193
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,440
Wouldn't it be wrong to just steal their answers?

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,040
Are those your first words for meeting after two years?

195
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,800
So what? What should we talk about?

196
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,200
You said you'll go to SNU. So why did you become a cop?

197
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,280
I couldn't apply for transfer before I ran away, so I missed CSAT.

198
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,120
I took the GED, and took police exam, too.

199
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
I've been busy for two years.

200
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,160
So why did you run away? Like an idiot.

201
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,520
Then, how have you been?

202
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,200
Have you been doing smart, unlike me?

203
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,040
I've been doing fine, of course.

204
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,080
Seeing that you're trying to be a cop??

205
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,040
Are you helping

206
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,080
your prosecutor "brother" and detective "sister" with your power?

207
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
Like investigation counseling or something?

208
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,720
In a technical term, I can say that I'm a psychometrist.

209
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,880
Really? You're really doing that?

210
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,480
Of course.

211
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
- Oh! - What do you see?

212
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Shh.

213
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,520
I see a knife.

214
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,160
It's very long, and sharp.

215
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,320
He must be a gangster or a killer, am I right?

216
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,960
He's a sashimi chef, with 30 years of experience.

217
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Sung-mo.

218
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,000
So you just need to see the license plate number of the car.

219
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
If you ever tell us the underwear sizes??You know, right?

220
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,440
Ahn, you can do this.

221
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,400
I clearly saw it. I'm sure this time.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
1946.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
Ah!

224
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
See? I told you he'd see this, right?

225
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,440
Arigato. Arigato. (="Thank you" in Japanese)

226
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,160
Detective Eun.

227
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,040
If you ever bring him here again,

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,800
then you'll be lying here next time.

229
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
Wow, both Ji-soo and Sung-mo are making a fuss.

230
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
"You need to become an official cop soon."

231
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,800
"We can't hide your powers to the superiors anymore." Like that.

232
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,760
Wow, that's great.

233
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,040
What about you? Uh??Is your job as a cop okay?

234
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,560
It's hard, but it's rewarding.

235
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,240
Where do you work at? Around here? In Seoul?

236
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,200
At Seoheun Patrol Division.

237
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,080
You mean??A criminal team?

238
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,240
No, I'm still a junior cop. An apprentice cop.

239
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,320
But I think I'll soon transfer to that team.

240
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Well, you've always been smart, even back then.

241
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,480
Get in. I'll take you.

242
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,000
No, thanks. I have an appointment.

243
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
Ah??

244
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Hey.

245
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,080
Make your power great and awesome!

246
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,160
If you do, when I'm confident,

247
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,160
I will go look for you.

248
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Why?

249
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I still live there.

250
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,680
That very place. On the rooftop.

251
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,480
Okay.

252
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,280
- I'm leaving. - Ah, okay.

253
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Bye.

254
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
Seoheun Patrol Division.

255
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
Good. That's good enough.

256
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,360
I haven't seen you in a million years.

257
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,600
- Is Ahn doing well? - Yes.

258
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,520
He's not causing trouble here and there, right?

259
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,080
Well, he's all grown up now.

260
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,720
Wow, it's amazing.

261
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,160
How did you reform a kid like Ahn?

262
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,680
As you know, he used to act like he could destroy everything

263
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,120
even when someone touched him.

264
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,680
And you made a kid like that graduate from high school.

265
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
He has become a human being. Althogu??

266
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
- Although he's still unemployed. - Right.

267
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,240
- Goodbye. - Bye.

268
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,320
Sung-mo!

269
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,040
Hey, why are you so happy?

270
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,440
Did you do well on the police exam?

271
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
Ah, right, I took an exam, right?

272
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,640
Did I write my name down?

273
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,480
So you couldn't see the answer sheet of the person in front of you?

274
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,880
That's good, then. I don't need to report you for cheating.

275
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,560
Were you going to report me?

276
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,920
Do you want me to live off you forever?

277
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,600
Aren't you scared of that? People live quite long these days.

278
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,160
It's okay. You're worthy enough for me.

279
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,880
Worthy?

280
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,800
How??How am I worthy for you?

281
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,160
Because I saved you.

282
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,040
It feels like I'm keeping my visible achievement with me.

283
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Why can't you think that the worthy person you saved

284
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
becomes a cop and does worthy things,

285
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
then your achievement will grow bigger,

286
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
like a structure of a pyramid?

287
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Hey, so, do you have to become a cop?

288
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,040
Of course.

289
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,120
It was obvious that I was going to die,

290
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
but you saved me, and I got a weird power.

291
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,480
Then the right thing to do is to use this power.

292
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,600
It's a crime to keep it hidden.

293
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,160
The real problem is that your skills are uncertain to use.

294
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,040
Wow, you are so mean.

295
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,680
Does it make you happy to save me and hurt me?

296
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,160
You perverted psychopath.

297
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,040
Sorry, I didn't know that could hurt you.

298
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,320
You're so narrow-minded, huh?

299
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
How did you become a prosecutor when you don't know the fact

300
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,600
that you should buy beer too when you buy chicken?

301
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,920
It's such a mystery.

302
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,280
Wow, the chicken smells so good.

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
By the way, why are we here? Why aren't we going home?

304
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,360
This is home.

305
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Huh?

306
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,000
I told you a few days ago that we will move.

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,960
I even put the address on the refrigerator.

308
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,480
I still live there.

309
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,040
That very place. On the rooftop.

310
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Huh? Oh, no.

311
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,600
Go on in first. It's No. 614.

312
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
I'll go buy some beer and??

313
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,760
But I just love that rooftop.

314
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,280
It's cool in winter, perfect to get a tan in summer,

315
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,120
and it's wide open, so there's no privacy.

316
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,920
Coochie-coochie-coo.

317
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,040
And it has the best view in Korea??

318
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,840
I mean, this place does.

319
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Wow??This is our house? Really?

320
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,760
Now this looks like a house of a prosecutor.

321
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,320
No, technically, it't a house of a bank.

322
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,000
My share is quite small, so I'm embarrassed to call it mine.

323
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm embarrassed, too.

324
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,160
The rooftop is more comfortable to live off, you know.

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,280
I told you earlier.

326
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
You're my??

327
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,480
Achievement.

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,720
Aching mole?

329
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
What makes you Prosecutor Kang's aching mole?

330
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,320
It's about two of us.

331
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,920
What the heck? Is this your new house with secrets?

332
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,200
Anyway, this is my housewarming gift.

333
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Thank you.

334
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,640
What is this? Did you two have a telepathy, or plot this?

335
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
I know, right? I was about to ask to order chicken, too.

336
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
Go ahead. I'll go wash myself.

337
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah, take your time. There are only two drumsticks.

338
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,320
On second thought, I need to eat before I wash.

339
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,440
By the way, what is that?

340
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,080
That overly girly look of yours.

341
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,000
I had a blind date because my father insisted.

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
Okay.

343
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,160
If so, I am going to cold read you right now.

344
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,000
(without knowing anything about the person)

345
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
You're blushing, so you already had a drink with him.

346
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,800
And you bought more than 10 cans of beer,

347
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,840
so it means it didn't go well.

348
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,160
No. My blind date went so well.

349
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,000
He totally fell for me.

350
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,400
Do you want this?

351
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,720
Ah, I see. So your blind date went well.

352
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,200
What about your exam?

353
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
Forget about the exam.

354
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
Ji-soo, have you heard of Seoheun Patrol Division?

355
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes, our station is in charge of that division. Why?

356
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,040
Really?

357
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,360
Why do you ask? What are you thinking?

358
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,560
She became a cop.

359
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,280
"She?"

360
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,920
The girl who framed me for being a pervert in high school, remember?

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
The hydrochloric acid attack.

362
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,720
You found her?

363
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
So you remember her too, huh?

364
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,040
Was her name Yoon Jae-in?

365
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,440
Ah, she suddenly disappeared just before CSAT,

366
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,680
and she became a cop without going to college?

367
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,320
Yes, she did.

368
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,640
Well,

369
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,760
many kids these days skip college after they graduate

370
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,000
from high school and prepare to become public servants.

371
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,320
Aren't they all doing great, at a young age?

372
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,880
Unlike this other guy I know.

373
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm going to wash myself.

374
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm sorry, but we can't reach her, either.

375
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,520
And the supporting fund isn't being deposited, either.

376
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,240
Perhaps that child

377
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,160
might need more time.

378
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,360
I'm still a loser, without a school or a job,

379
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,240
but she became awesome.

380
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,960
That's how first love is like.

381
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,160
It's bitter, like this beer.

382
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,600
And it makes me feel bloated when I think of it.

383
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,120
Ji-soo, why are you so centimeter today?

384
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,840
Sentimental. Sentimental.

385
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,080
Something happened, huh?

386
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,040
If you don't explain it to me in an understandable way,

387
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,760
then I might find it out for myself.

388
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
Damn it.

389
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,160
Ugh.

390
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,080
Where do you get that groundless confidence?

391
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,880
You only see unnecessary things.

392
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,600
I don't know about other people,

393
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,800
but your brain is as simple as Dae-bong's,

394
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
so my psychometry works well on you.

395
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm going to do it.

396
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,480
Ugh, come on.

397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,760
Alright, it'd be better to confess than to be embarrassed.

398
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,680
I asked Prosecutor Kang out, and got rejected.

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,720
Again?

400
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,040
What do you mean, again?

401
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
Did you know?

402
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,040
There's a rumor about us dating at the Prosecution Service?

403
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,560
Not just at the Prosecution Service.

404
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
It has spread at the Police Agency, too.

405
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,000
You know, you're being friendly to me,

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,640
unlike the way you act toward other people,

407
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,000
and since we're together quite often,

408
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,160
people said that we make a cute couple.

409
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,480
You know??

410
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,760
By any chance, as things have turned out like this,

411
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,040
we should just turn that minsunderstanding into reality??

412
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,920
Sorry.

413
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,840
Ah??We've been dropping formalities way too much.

414
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,880
I was foolish.

415
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,800
From now on, I will use honorifics and keep a social distance.

416
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm leaving. Goodbye to you too, Detective Eun.

417
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,440
It must've been a shock. I only saw that from you for a while.

418
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,960
And you asked him out again?

419
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,920
What a wonderful courage.

420
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,080
You're wonderful, Eun Ji-soo.

421
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,680
Shut up.

422
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey, you should've told me if you knew about it.

423
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,520
Everyone knows that you like Sung-mo.

424
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Your face writes, "I like Sung-mo,"

425
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,720
you follow him around, and you asked him to eat and drink with you.

426
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,600
And why did you come here after being rejected? How embarrassing.

427
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,120
Uh, since you moved, and I was curious about the exam.

428
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
I'm always the excuse, huh?

429
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah, you two "brothers" go on and break my heart.

430
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,080
Do you even know how much I care for you?

431
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,960
So you came because of me? Really?

432
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,160
Can you swear to God that it's completely true?

433
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,160
"No. My blind date went so well."

434
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,240
"He totally fell for me."

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,160
When you said that,

436
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,720
I could totally tell your true intentions.

437
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,800
Could you?

438
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,840
Ugh, this is embarrassing.

439
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,480
Ugh, I'm leaving.

440
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
Ask Sung-mo to take you home when he comes out.

441
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,520
You can grow out of embarrassment if you keep on trying it.

442
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
No, thanks.

443
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
I know you won't go far, Ji-soo.

444
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,720
Want some?

445
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,560
I still live there.

446
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,320
That very place. On the rooftop.

447
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,160
Okay.

448
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,120
I have to tell her where I live,

449
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,440
so I'm going. That's why.

450
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,760
That's the only reason.

451
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,240
Ugh??Hey, won't you return my car?

452
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,120
Hey, let me drive it for one more day.

453
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,080
Ugh, but it really is important.

454
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Is there another convincing reason why I should

455
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
let you borrow my lucky car?

456
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
Yoon Jae-in.

457
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,840
I found out where she is.

458
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,040
Ugh??Yoon Jae-in, Yoon Jae-in, all the time.

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,160
Get off the phone.

460
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,440
I love you, Dae-bong!

461
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,880
Welcome.

462
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,640
Come on, we have a car coming in, sir.

463
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
I know.

464
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,600
Ugh, Yoon Jae-in? That's been like forever. How ridiculous.

465
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,360
Yes, how much gas would you like?

466
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,560
Is this??your gas station, too?

467
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,000
Huh? Oh, yes, uh??

468
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Ah??We purchased it recently.

469
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,120
Just put $30 worth of gas in it.

470
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,240
Huh? Uh??

471
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,400
Can you, please??open??open this?

472
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,120
Oh, thanks.

473
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,520
Ugh, damn it, what should I say? What should I say?

474
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,600
- Hey. - Huh?

475
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,240
It's been so long, right?

476
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,680
Uh??I need to make the payment.

477
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,120
Oh, hey, why pay? We're alumni. Just go. It's okay.

478
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,040
But there are tons of alumni in this neighborhood.

479
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,280
Oh, I always give gas for free for all of them.

480
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,160
I knew you'd do this,

481
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,120
so I've been avoiding your gas stations.

482
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Don't do that.

483
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,000
Let me make the payment.

484
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
So-hyun.

485
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,120
These are for all of my first-time customers.

486
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,640
It really is a part of my marketing strategy.

487
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,200
- Okay. Thanks. - Yeah.

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,160
Sir, what are you doing?

491
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
"A Baby??

492
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,240
I never knew that a baby being in the car could be so hurtful.

493
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,400
She's not here?

494
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,640
Why isn't the cop named Yoon Jae-in here? Why?

495
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,120
Because she's not here.

496
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,320
Huh? But she said that she works here.

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
I've never heard of that name.

498
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,960
What the heck?

499
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Did she lie to me?

500
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,800
Yoon Jae-in? Isn't she

501
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
the junior cop at Seoheun Security Center?

502
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,440
You know, the office-residence place.

503
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
- Ah, there's a place like that? - Yes.

504
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
- Seoheun Security Center? - Yes.

505
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,440
Okay, thank you.

506
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,960
Thank you, thank you.

507
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,240
Security Center?

508
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,080
Office-residence??What?

509
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,840
Hello?

510
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Hi, Ji-soo.

511
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,760
Oh, Seoheun Security Center?

512
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,000
Yes, I know. It's at the edge of Seoheun-dong.

513
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,720
By the way, is it still there?

514
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,320
By the way, what's office-residence?

515
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,120
It means she lives and works there altogether.

516
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,920
- There's a house in the station? - Yes.

517
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,560
Hey, by the way, does she work there?

518
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,480
Ah, but that place is??kind of not really good.

519
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,320
What do you mean, it's kind of not really good?

520
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,040
I found this in front of the store.

521
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,000
Please find its owner.

522
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,200
Here.

523
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,080
This child has done a good thing and set an example for the others,

524
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,000
and hereby given with this award.

525
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,920
Wow, you did so well.

526
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,400
Thank you.

527
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,120
(Seoheun Security Center)

528
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,160
Granny, it't not here.

529
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Here. Look.

530
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Do you see that red gate over there?

531
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,440
Joo-ha, did you tell a lie?

532
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,160
Oh, wow, you're in big trouble.

533
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,720
You need to be cuffed and go to prison, huh?

534
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,120
Say that you won't do it ever again.

535
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,000
I will never lie again.

536
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,920
You know, that place has small population,

537
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,040
has no cases or accidents,

538
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,720
and the work hours are from 9 to 6 sharp.

539
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,280
The good thing is, it's a perfect workplace,

540
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,080
but the bad thing is, you can't expect to build your career there.

541
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,320
But why did a young girl like her end up going there?

542
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,040
- Child. - Oh, Granny.

543
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,600
- This is for you. - Thank you.

544
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,760
- Go on and eat it. - Okay.

545
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,320
- Be careful on your way. - Okay.

546
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,200
Damn it.

547

(Seoheun Security Center)

548
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,000
Ugh, I didn't know you were here, so I went to the Patrol Division.

549
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,080
I didn't expect you to come for real.

550
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,640
I didn't lie to you.

551
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,360
Seoheun Patrol Division is in charge of this place,

552
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,400
and I will move to the criminal team soon.

553
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,320
I wrote it down as my top preference.

554
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,720
What Ji-soo said is

555
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,600
that the cops waiting to be retired come and work here.

556
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,040
How could a junior cop come here?

557
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,400
My superior was transferred to this place,

558
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,960
so I asked him if there was any affordable houses here,

559
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,720
and he told me to stay here.

560
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,160
Because he has an apartment already.

561
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,840
You told someone that you need a house? That's not like you.

562
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,720
I got caught while taking a peek at old investigation files.

563
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,440
- You did? - So I told him the truth.

564
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,520
Because if I get fired as a junior cop, I can't be an official cop.

565
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,280
I'm too old to run away now,

566
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,800
and I have a social position, though it is vague,

567
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,680
so that was the only way to prevent myself from getting fired.

568
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,960
So, did you take a look at the files about your father?

569
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,520
He said never.

570
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,000
The record will be left on the computer, and he said

571
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,120
he will never get annuity if he gets fired before his retirement.

572
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,560
He told me to become an official cop and find out for myself.

573
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,560
And then he came to this Security Center in this small town.

574
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,480
It??It seems that I have been made a fool of myself, huh?

575
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,080
Can you really go to the criminal team from here?

576
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,400
I heard that there are no cases or accidents here.

577
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,080
When can you build your career and achievements,

578
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,040
move to the Patrol Division and go to the main Agency?

579
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,120
Oh??So you actually know about that?

580
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,400
Because that's what I am trying to do.

581
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,480
I need to do something to actually find

582
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,280
a place for me to go into.

583
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,760
But that's not easy??

584
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,080
Aha.

585
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,720
You said you're helping your "brother" and "sister,"

586
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,000
but you're still blocked by your "brother," right?

587
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You see??Ugh, I??

588
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,520
Oh, my, Officer Lady. Joo-ha went missing.

589
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,680
Huh? Oh, no.

590
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,200
Perhaps it's because we scolded her earlier.

591
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,040
Ugh, that little bratty girl is nothing but trouble.

592
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
It'll be fine.

593
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,360
You go there and look for her. I will go this way.

594
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
Shouldn't you call the Patrol Division?

595
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
She runs away from her house habitually.

596
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,520
She's on the blacklist of our Security Center.

597
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,240
Hey, but what if it's kidnapping or going missing??

598
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
Joo-ha!

599
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,040
Don't say such thing.

600
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,240
I'm not wanting those things to happen

601
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,200
just because I need to solve a case and go to a criminal team.

602
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,600
Hey, I didn't say that.

603
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,240
I'm just worried, that's all.

604
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Hurry up.

605
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Damn it.

606
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,520
Joo-ha!

607
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,440

(Seoheun Store)

609
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,160
Have you seen Joo-ha?

610
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,240
No, I haven't. Is something wrong?

611
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,160
If you see her, please call us.

- Joo-ha! - Joo-ha!

614

Have you seen a little girl by any chance?

615
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Thank you.

616
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,080
Joo-ha!

617
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Where is she hiding at?

618
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Hasn't it been an hour since she disappeared?

619
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm sure she's hiding somewhere.

620
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,920
Kids always cause trouble at where we can't see them.

621
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,000
What the heck?

622
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,560
You said that you don't want this thing to happen.

623
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,120
Stop saying ominous things.

624
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,800
Huh?

625
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,080
What? What is it?

626
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,440
That's the stuffed toy Joo-ha carries with her all the time.

627
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,160
What is it?

628
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Hey, what's wrong with you?

629
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,040
Don't get shocked, and listen to me.

630
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,920
I think this child

631
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,600
- has been kidnapped. - What?

632
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,640
I just saw it with psychometry,

633
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,760
and she's in a luggage. A piece of black luggage.

634
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,880
No way.

635
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,120
Officer Yoon, what are you doing over there?

636
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,080
Ugh, you bratty girl. What are you doing here?

637
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,800
Ugh, seriously.

638
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,440
Huh? My bunny.

639
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,840
The smell must be bad because it's been dry these days.

640
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,720
Eww, poo, poo, poo.

641
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,680
Be careful, you never know when it will flow down.

642
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm going back to the Center.

643
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,400
Is she the kid who went missing?

644
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,680
Is she the one who was in a luggage?

645
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Uh, that's weird. I'm sure I saw

646
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,160
black hair sticking out from the luggage.

647
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Do you really want to make a case happen?

648
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,760
What is this? Is this imaginary psychometry?

649
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,080
Ugh, that scared me.

650
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,360
Ugh, I saw it. I saw it for sure.

651
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,120
That's weird.

652
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,280
When I picked up the bunny right here??

653
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Yoon Jae-in.

654
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
- Hey, Yoon Jae-in. - What? What now?

655
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,120
Don't talk to me unless there's a real luggage with a body.

656
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,120
There is.

657
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,680
There is. I'm serious.

658
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,920
We need to take a good look, but we think it's a woman.

659
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,040
- What is going on this time? - I know, right?

660
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,760
Uh, by the way, what should we do with him?

661
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,080
He finished his testimony as a witness and he can leave,

662
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,280
but he insists that he needs to see you.

663
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Detective Lee, take the luggage to Dr. Hong.

664
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,160
I'll take care of him before I go.

665
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,000
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,600
I found it. I did.

667
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,200
My hands saw the luggage, and I saw the dead body in my head.

668
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,000
You did something after a while. Anything else?

669
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,720
Anything else? Like what?

670
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,440
The culprit's face? Don't worry.

671
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,000
I will check this entire area even if I have to stay up all night.

672
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,160
I am going to touch every single blade of grass.

673
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Even if I die out of exhaustion,

674
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,120
I will see the culprit's face.

675
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,080
I don't think you need to do that much.

676
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,040
Nevermind.

677
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,360
I know you won't listen to me even if I try to stop you.

678
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,760
That means you're giving me a permission, right? You did.

679
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,960
You don't need to do that in this place. Don't waste your energy.

680
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,400
I told you about her, right?

681
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
My friend at Seoheun Security Center.

682
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,080
Long time no see.

683
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,320
To be honest, she knows about my power, too.

684
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,760
What did you mean when you told him not to waste his energy?

685
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,400
You know what it means, Detective.

686
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,680
I know, but I'm wondering if you know something, Officer Yoon.

687
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,320
The luggage must've flowed toward Hangang River

688
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,080
when there was heavy rain about a month ago.

689
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,000
And it must've surfaced because it didn't rain for a while

690
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,480
and the water has dried up.

691
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,480
What? Hangang River?

692
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
What's the reason for you to think that?

693
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,200
The bodies that committed suicide or have been abandoned

694
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,160
in Hangang River flow in from the upstream of this stream.

695
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,000
It's the first time it flowed into our town, though.

696
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,480
But that's not concrete enough to think it flowed like that.

697
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,720
When I heard that a black luggage with a body in it was found

698
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,120
at the downstream of the upper town, I went to the scene.

699
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,560
But the luggage looked the same from the one found there,

700
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,080
and the condition was similar, too.

701
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,120
It's been presumed to have been murdered about 4 to 5 years ago,

702
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,760
and the body has been identified, but the culprit isn't found.

703
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,920
Is that enough?

704
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,800
Hey, did you hear that?

705
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,440
Your friend told you not to waste your energy here.

706
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,920
That's ridiculous, okay?

707
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,360
How can a luggage with a body flow from Hangang River to here?

708
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,840
It's too heavy to do that.

709
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The buoyancy by gas from decompostion is quite powerful.

710
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,480
There was a case in which a body in the water hanging onto

711
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,280
25 to 30 kg of concrete floated to the surface.

712
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,680
I read that it is possible up to 70 kg.

713
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,720
Officer Yoon, are you in charge of watching the police line here?

714
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,040
- Yes, ma'am. - Good. Then,

715
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,360
please make sure that he doesn't come near here.

716
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,000
He did not understand even a single thing about what you said.

717
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,720
- Yes, ma'am. - I did. Gas from destruction.

718
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,400
- Gas from decomposition. - Gas from decomposition.

719
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,040
A body was found? At a stream here?

720
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
Yeah, so Officer Yoon has been sent there.

721
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,440
Things turned annoying.

722
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,600
I applied for this Center because there are no cases here.

723
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,080
Something seems ominous.

724
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,000
Today, Jae-in,

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,120
no, Officer Yoon, is suppoed to

726
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,760
hold an education for kids at the day care to prevent going missing.

727
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,440
She makes things to do.

728
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,520
- Shall we do it later? - No, I'll do it.

729
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,160
Alright, children, gather up.

730
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,880
Gather up, children.

731
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,240
If you don't gather up, you'll be arrested. Gather up.

732
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,440
Everyone in the Petal Class.

733
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,080
Let's gather up.

734
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,680
Yes, Ms. Kim.

735
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,720
Alright, sit here, Petal Class.

736
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,000
Okay, sit here, and sit here.

737
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,160
A case broke out in this town? That's unusual.

738
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,280
I hate those jerks who throw the body into the water the most.

739
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,800
Ugh, you said that you hate those who throw it into a sewage tank.

740
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,000
I must've killed a person like this

741
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,800
and abandoned the body in my previous life.

742
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,120
Hey, if not, how am I making a living

743
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,960
by doing this for half of my life?

744
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm being punished for sure.

745
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,960
Then what about me?

746
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,800
If so, I must've been your accomplice

747
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,200
or an abetter at least.

748
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,600
I told you not to waste your energy.

749
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,280
But this is the only thing I can do right now.

750
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,040
- Do you see anything? - Of course.

751
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,160
Bird poo.

752
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,080
Dog poo.

753
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,520
And people, too? Oh, come on.

754
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,840
Don't work in vain.

755
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,280
I'm telling you, the culprit didn't come anywhere around here.

756
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,280
Ah, but this is the perfect timing to do something.

757
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,440
Still, I did appeal to Detective Eun.

758
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,680
Are you trying to survive all by yourself?

759
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,600
I'm only watching the police line for now,

760
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,160
but this is my first case.

761
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,840
I only helped people with lost and found, and on some days,

762
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,080
my day's work was over even without that.

763
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,640
So I found the body of

764
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,400
your first case, huh?

765
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,000
Even if it wasn't for you, I would've found it.

766
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,480
That luggage was obviously suspicious.

767
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,440
Didn't you say that my power is an imaginary psychometry? Huh?

768
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,480
And you told me not to talk to you unless there was a luggage.

769
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,360
Remember how you just left with coldness all over you?

770
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,080
Okay, I admit it.

771
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,400
You've admitted a bit too late,

772
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,000
but I forgive you.

773
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Look how excited you are.

774
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,560
Ah, by the way??Could you please repeat what you said?

775
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,640
What Buoyancy?

776
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,840
I explained it three times already.

777
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,800
No, I think I roughly understood that.

778
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,520
But what was it about a similar luggage being found in upper town?

779
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,640
Does it mean??this is a serial murder?

780
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,800
The luggage is the same kind from the case with Park Soo-young,

781
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,440
the previous victim who was in her 40s.

782
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,040
This time, it's a woman who is presumed to be in her 50s,

783
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,000
and seeing how she's wearing winter clothes and black boots,

784
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,840
the time of hear death was in winter.

785
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,120
And the luggage is filled with lumps of cement,

786
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,080
which is identical to the method from the previous case.

787
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,640
Anything we can use to indentify her with?

788
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,000
The body has become adipocere, so we can collect fingerprints.

789
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It'd be troublesome if we indentify her and miss the culprit again.

790
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,960
That was because the deceased had no family

791
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,320
and we couldn not confirm the time she went missing. But this time??

792
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,440
What? If we can't confirm the time, we can't find the culprit again?

793
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
No, uh??

794
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,040
Having one body and having two bodies cannot be the same.

795
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,160
I'm sure there's a connection between the two bodies.

796
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,240
Well, since Prosecutor Kang is in it, so I'll count on you,

797
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,760
but hurry up as fast as you can.

798
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,280
Yes, sir.

799
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,200
There isn't even a single celebrity scandal these days,

800
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,080
so cases like this remain on the web portal for too long.

801
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,360
Do it right before we get comments saying that we're incompetent.

802
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,160
Why is he so grumpy today?

803
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,160
What the heck?

804
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,720
Is it because you're not getting married, Detective Eun?

805
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,120
Shut up, will you?

806
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,200
I see.

807
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
Ah, that's Commissioner Eun alright.

808
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,440
I thought he was strict in investigations,

809
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,920
even if his daughter is working on it, but??

810
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,360
So much for being strict.

811
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,280
He's just a hysterical old man.

812
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,800
He set me up on blind dates every week

813
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,320
saying that even if I work with loads of stress,

814
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,480
I will quit my job once I get married,

815
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,200
but he changed his plan.

816
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,000
Still, he is a great man.

817
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,160
He started as an ordinary officer and became the commissioner.

818
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,760
Let's meet again when National Forensic Service calls us.

819
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Okay.

820
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,520
Why?

821
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,440
Hey, what do you think the main point of our conversation was?

822
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,840
About identifying the deceased!

823
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,920
No, not at the meeting. I mean out here.

824
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,640
Hmm??your??marriage?

825
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,240
Right? You think that's the main point too, right?

826
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,000
But Prosecutor Kang finished our conversation

827
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,840
with a topic about my dad.

828
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,560
I'm sure he thought no one would notice,

829
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,920
but I noticed.

830
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Wow??Isn't he a trickster?

831
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,200
Uh??Does finishing the conversation with the topic

832
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,920
about Commissioner Eun make him a trickster?

833
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,200
And what kind of a trickster does he become?

834
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,840
You'll have a hard time too.

835
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,680
How can you investigate if you're so insensitive?

836
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,760
Commissioner Eun??Trickster??

837
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,320
Oh, uh, wait for me, Detective Eun.

838
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,120
(6:00, Oct. 3, 2016, Murder and Fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital)

839
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,080
(Victims: Yoo Eun-ok, Jung Man-soon)

840
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,400
(/Assailant: Song Hee-jeong)

841
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,760
(Missing: Kang Hee-sook, caretaker at Hanmin Nursing Hospital)

842
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,160
(Witness: Kim Gap-yong)

843
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,440
(Punctured wound on right abdomen)

844
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,760
(Chain on right ankle)

845
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,400
(Oct. 27, 2016, Found at construction site of Raon Building)

846
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,800
(by YSS Construction)

847
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,560
(Who is the culprit of the Kim Gap-yong case?)

848
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,640
(Assailant: Yoon Tae-ha, security guard at Yeongseong Apt.)

849
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,120
(The abandoned luggage case)

850
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,520
For your information, "he" found the body for this case.

851
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,680
If he finds out that his "brother" is in charge, you'll suffer.

852
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,880
So brace yourself.

853
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,200
I texted him with the most business-like tone.

854
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,720
Without a trace of any emotions.

855
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,680
Good. Well done.

856
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,680
So I need to keep on doing this.

857
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,080
Okay.

858
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,760
This is the text without a trace of

859
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,320
any emotions, Detective Eun.

860
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,200
Ugh, seriously.

861
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,160
My combat power is rising.

862
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,360
(Black luggage murder in Seoheun-gu, nothing known)

863
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,280
It was a woman in her 40s last time,

864
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,680
and it's a woman again.

865
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
Okay, I see.

866
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,000
They said I can go back now.

867
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,640
I'm going back to the Security Center.

868
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,400
Are you going to stay here?

869
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,720
Huh?

870
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,040
Hey.

871
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,680
Hey, isn't anyone watching this area?

872
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,600
I told you, it't no use to investigate this area.

873
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,720
All of the evidence are in that luggage.

874
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
Aren't you coming?

875
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,960
Ah, and one more thing.

876
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,120
His alumna, who became a cop,

877
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,280
found the body with him.

878
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,520
Both of them are excited.

879
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,480
So you really need to brace yourself.

880
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,200
Ah??I should've touched it a bit more.

881
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,280
We handed it over too early.

882
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,280
I should've opened it and touched it.

883
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,120
Are you sure that's all you saw?

884
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,360
The luggage and the body with black hair?

885
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,040
Yes.

886
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,240
It is a bit of a waste.

887
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,120
But it's weird.

888
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,640
For some reason, my psychometry works well when I'm with you.

889
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,160
No way, isn't that just how you feel?

890
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,880
It was the same

891
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,160
when I was at the teacher's office with you two years ago.

892
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,640
That's weird.

893
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,720
And you've been studying a lot, huh?

894
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,600
About investigations.

895
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,400
I've been interested in these things since I was young.

896
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,320
I hated cops so much when my father was framed,

897
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,520
but when I think of it now, it was a fallacy of hasty generalization.

898
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,000
Uh, hmm, hmm.

899
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,040
A fallacy of hasty??

900
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,000
Ah, that.

901
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,080
About your detective "sister."

902
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,000
Detective Eun.

903
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,560
As soon as the math teacher was released,

904
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,160
she came to see me at the convenience store.

905
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,840
She was angry at it like it was her business,

906
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,200
and she made you my bodyguard,

907
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,240
so I thought, maybe not all of

908
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,640
the detectives are the same.

909
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,920
Is that why you took the police exam?

910
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,640
I decided to check three, four or five times

911
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,000
when the suspect says that he or she isn't the culprit

912
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
if I become a cop, so I can prevent

913
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,560
anyone to suffer like my dad

914
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,160
or me, ever again.

915
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,760
Even if I don't clear my dad's false charges,

916
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,400
that would be worthy enough.

917
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,680
So you finally started to think of your own life?

918
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,160
Regardless of your dad.

919
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,560
- Sung-mo. - Long time no see.

920
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,040
Officer Yoon Jae-in.

921
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,640
Daddy-Long-Legs.

922
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,600
Daddy??what?

923
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,240
(He is Psychometric)

924
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,880
My dad will be resented forever, right?

925
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,520
If the culprit isn't found, then this will turn into a cold case.

926
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,720
Wake up.

927
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,040
They're looking down on you and bullying you for your attitude.

928
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,880
Could you please give me some time to think about it?

929
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,360
Huh? I'm sorry,

930
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,120
but that person doesn't want any further troubles.

931
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,840
- Who was it again? - Remember? Kang Hee-sook.

932
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,000
Who are you?
