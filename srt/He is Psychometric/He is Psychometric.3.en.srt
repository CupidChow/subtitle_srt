Yes.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Then can you please tell him to release my dad?

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,880
My dad isn't a bad guy. He really isn't.

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,880
Would you like one more candy?

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
No, not the candy. I mean your dad,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
no, my dad. We're talking about my dad.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,880
My dad isn't around.

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
Why not?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
Did he??go somewhere?

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,040
There was a fire at the apartment, so my mom, my dad,

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,360
and lots of people died.

I want to help you too, but??I'm sorry.

So?

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
What is it that you want to find out with my psychometry,

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,920
by shaking hands or anything?

29
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,000
You see??

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I must've gotten crazy after hearing such an insane story.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Forget about what I said earlier.

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
Don't worry.

33
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,840
I got grade rank of 15 by reading OMR answer sheets with this.

And I revealed that So-hyun is the culprit.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Where??Where should you touch for good psychometry?

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
First??

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,160
Hands, I guess.

38
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,360
Perhaps because the fingertips have the most sensitive skin.

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,200
Ah, so you can feel it well if you touch sensitive skin, right?

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,000
So it reacts to the touch, huh?

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, I think so.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,520
But the most sensitive part is??

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,200
The lips, right?

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
How about it?

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,080
Want to try psychometry?

46
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,080
Oh, wow.

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,280
What kind of dream was that?

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
What am I, a middle schooler?

49
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Ugh, this is embarrassing.

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
Ugh, it's embarrassing, even though I'm alone.

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Let's continue dreaming.

52
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,200
Do I look like a freak?

53
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,880
No need to look at me like that.

54
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,600
It's okay as long as you don't touch me.

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,240
No, if you really do that psychometry thing,

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
and found out my dad's prisoner number with that??

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,920
What?

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
Then you're not a freak.

59
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,640
I want you to find out about something by

60
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,440
me running to you and shaking hands, or anything.

61
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
Shaking hands, or anything?

62
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
You stay right there!

63
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
I'll go to you!

64
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,520
Huh? Hey, where are you going in the middle of the night?

65
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,040
Huh?

66
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,080
What on earth did I say to him?

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
Who?

68
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,480
Nothing.

69
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
You've been weird since yesterday.

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,000
Is something troubling you?

71
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
- Auntie. - Yes?

72
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,160
If, by any chance, someone might be able to??

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,920
Nevermind.

74
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Someone might be able to what?

75
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,520
If someone might be able to clear Dad's false charges,

76
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
what would you do?

77
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,160
Your father's been in prison for 11 years.

78
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Isn't it meaningless at this point?

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,320
Why is it meaningless?

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,160
If that can be done, Dad can say that he's not a murderer

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,520
with confidence, and I??

82
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
I don't have to run away all the time

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,640
for being called a murderer's daughter, trembling with fear

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,120
that someone might recognize me.

85
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,240
But Jae-in.

86
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
This is the first time I'm telling you this.

87
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,760
What if??

88
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,440
What if your dad really did it?

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
No way.

90
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
How can someone who was a firefighter

91
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,040
burn dozens of people to death?

92
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,440
And four people were stabbed with a knife.

93
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,120
Dad isn't someone to do such a thing.

94
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,400
You never know what someone's thinking by looking at them.

95
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm going to school.

96
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
No.

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,600
No, Jae-in, what I meant is??

98
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,760
It’ll be hard to investigate a case from more than 10 years ago.

99
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,840
You'll end up getting hurt even more??

100
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Hi.

101
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,680
What??What's with that reaction?

102
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,160
You're acting completely different from yesterday.

103
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,000
You seemed like you were about to do something to me yesterday.

104
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
I was a bit excited yesterday??

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,400
This kind of vocabulary might call for another misunderstanding.

106
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,360
I went crazy yesterday for a moment. I was insane.

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,760
So let's say that I didn't hear it.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,720
You said that it's your father's prisoner number.

109
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,080
The number I read.

110
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,560
Was he framed?

111
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,640
And you want me to look into it, right?

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No.

113
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
I don't want you to look into it.

114
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
I want no one in this world to find out about it.

115
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,480
You said that the secret you want to keep

116
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
Is your power of psychometry, right?

117
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,400
To me, it's about my dad.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,000
So let's just say that neither of us heard anything.

119
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,080
And I forgot to tell you one thing.

120
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,840
Please don't tell the others that I live next door to you.

121
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,480
Especially??

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
The fact that I live on the rooftop.

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,160
Why? Well, I have no reason to tell,

124
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,320
but when someone tells me to shut up, I get rebellious.

125
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,680
As you know, we're teenagers in poverty.

126
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
You mean puberty.

127
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
I hate being looked down on and having my weakness revealed.

128
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
So, if you ever think of laying a finger on me

129
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,400
to find something out, I will kill you.

130
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Don't worry.

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't see anything anyway, unless I touch your skin.

132
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,680
Ugh, the bus isn't for me at all.

133
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
You go ahead first.

134
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,560
- Uh, what happened? - She's gone.

135
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,680
What? Who?

136
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
The ring.

137
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
Did you lose your ring??in my car?

138
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,320
Oh, come on.

139
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
I mean Kang Hee-sook the caregiver.

140
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
I was kidding. But the timing was bad.

141
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,040
We will now take off.

142
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,520
Hurry up, please.

143
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,000
It's no use.

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,520
I waited for her all night long last night, but she didn't come.

145
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,760
What did the landlord say?

146
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
He said that she was a desirable tenant who has been

147
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,520
living here for 3 years, and never had any overdue rent payment.

148
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,480
But someone else signed the lease on her behalf,

149
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,440
so he doesn't even know what she looks like.

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,800
She was unreachable after the fire??

151
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,680
So I investigated her

152
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
and she's quite suspicious.

153
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
She was seclusive with delinquent credit until 3 years ago,

154
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,480
then suddenly there's a trace of her reporting her revival,

155
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,240
getting a caregiver's certificate and starting to work.

156
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,040
But she has no friends.

157
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,920
She has no family, either.

158
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,400
And there's no one to tell us about her.

159
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
She's like invisible.

160
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,280
Ah, I showed her photo to the nurses,

161
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,120
and they said, "Do we know her?"

162
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,000
Invisible?

163
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
I feel like I'm tracking down a ghost,

164
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,880
and I don't even know why I am looking for her.

165
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
I shouldn't have let Ahn perform psychometry.

166
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
It's just so bothersome.

167
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,480
Her phone is suddenly out of service. It is weird for sure.

168
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,680
So, what do you think we should do?

169
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
I'll just report her as a missing person, and wrap this up.

170
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
If I tell the superiors that this woman seems weird

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
and we should dig deeper into the fire case,

172
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,840
then I'll end up being the lunatic.

173
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,520
Commissioner Eun would be the happiest one.

174
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, please.

175
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
Ugh, it's bothersome.

176
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,200
Like I didn't wipe after pooping. Ugh.

177
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,720
Uh, I mean, it just feels like that.

178
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
Let's go eat breakfast.

179
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,640
(Traditional spicy beef soup)

180
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,320
Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!

181
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!

182
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,840
It's a disaster!

183
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,520
What disaster? The math teacher being fired?

184
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Or those who stole the answers running away to study abroad?

185
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,000
Life is so easy for those rich kids, right?

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,200
No, that's not what's important right now.

187
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,280
- Hey. - Why?

188
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Have you been beaten up by your father?

189
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,240
Ugh, I could've been expelled, but this stopped it.

190
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,160
But I wasn't beaten up with a golf club. So it's okay.

191
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,920
But that's not what's important right now??

192
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,120
- It must be So-hyun. - Yes, it is So-hyun.

193
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,800
So-hyun came to school today.

194
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,840
But should I ask her? About??what she will do with her baby.

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,160
That baby has nothing to do with you.

196
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,960
Let's not talk about "Your So-hyun" ever again, okay?

197
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,560
Because it reminds me of your betrayal.

198
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
It wasn't a betrayal??

199
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,400
Hey, if a simple jerk like you keeps a secret from me as well,

200
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,040
then who can I hang out with?

201
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,080
Ugh, damn it.

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,040
I hate those who say one thing and mean another.

203
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,440
Right? I was too harsh, wasn't I?

204
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,760
But the school won't be good for her baby's health, right?

205
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,080
Stop it already.

206
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,720
It won't be good though, right?

207
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960

208

209

Yoon Jae-in.

212
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,320
Want to go to a club with us today?

213
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080
Studying too hard will only give you a headache.

214
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,160
No, thanks.

215
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,720
We'll pay.

216
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,280
We think we finally have a kid who's on the same level as us,

217
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,080
so we're trying to welcome you.

218
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,240
Level?

219
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,840
My mom's a doctor,

220
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,600
and her parents own a famous barbecue restaurant franchise.

221
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,840
This school may be crappy,

222
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,800
but not all of the kids here are losers.

223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,680
It's hard to believe, but Ahn's "brother" is a prosecutor,

224
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,880
and Dae-bong's family owns gas stations, and he's rich.

225
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
Oh??Really?

226
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,680
So that's the level you are talking about.

227
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,360
Hey, even elementary school kids ask about house sizes

228
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,040
when they try to make friends.

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,160
Ah, my mom said that

230
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,880
your dad is bound to be elected. Lucky you.

231
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
I never said that my dad is running for office.

232
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
He isn't?

233
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not on the same level as you girls,

234
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,080
who are the daughters of a doctor and a restaurant franchise owner.

235
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
So you go ahead and have fun on your own.

236
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,520
You're so ridiculous.

237
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,400
Hey, just how great is your dad? Huh?

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
You're not on the same level as us?

239
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
Are you really that great?

240
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
Hey, Kim Eun-se, Oh Young-eun.

241
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,360
Make sure you separate trash properly, okay?

242
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,160
Why did you put a can in a bin for plastic?

243
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
You're acting like Lee Dae-bong!

244
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,360
We didn't throw it away.

245
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,760
Hey, I saw everything.

246
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,120
Make sure you do it right.

247
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm watching you.

248
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
Ugh, are you asleep?

249
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,240

therefore it will be processed as having no right of indictment."

Sign it, now.

255

You said you're uncomfortable because of the missing caregiver.

256
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,760
I could totally get the feeling of not wiping myself.

257

There's no other way, you know.

258

about the fire case for one last time.

I know it would be troublesome, but could you please come here?

264

Please.

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay.

Please take care of this patient.

Who are you?

I don't expect a warm welcome, but at least pretend that I'm here.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,440

Oh, me! I don't have anywhere to go to.

beating you up last night and sending a driver for you today.

You know, people are born with the rich vibe and looks.

314

Look at me. I look poor even if I ride expensive cars, right?

315
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Why? It's because my dad became rich suddenly.

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,840
If I were you, I would've been too ashamed to walk around.

331
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,920
Well then again if you felt shame, then you wouldn't have sold

332
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,040
exam questions to the students from the beginning.

333
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,760
Let go! Let go, you bastard! Let go!

334
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,200
Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn.

335
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
Let go of the teacher!

336
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,760
He's not a teacher.

337
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,440
He lost his position already.

338
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,040
This is hydrochloric acid.

339
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,120
I know. So what?

340
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,440
Is it dangerous?

341
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
Was selling exam questions such a bad thing to do?

342
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,040
Even a damn witch like that lives well. I didn't do anything wrong!

343
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,240
I will reveal your true self to the entire world, got it?

344
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
This is the CCTV footage.

345
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,840
And this is the drink bottle he tried to throw at me.

346
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm sure it's hydrochloric acid.

347
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,920
I heard that hydrochloric acid burns the skin.

348
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,160
Did you know?

349
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,760
Wow, he tried to throw it on a girl's face.

350
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,640
Wow, hey.

351
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,760
What could've happened if it wasn't for me? Huh?

352
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,680
You must've been shocked, but you secured the evidence well.

353
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you okay? Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,680
Ah??I'm okay.

355
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,440
If so, then you should testify at the police station.

356
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,040
I'll go after my part-time job.

357
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,080
I can't leave it unattended right now.

358
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,480
Yes, and call your parents.

359
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Wow, what a smart girl she is.

360
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,480
She's the polar opposite of this other kid I know.

361
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Who? Me?

362
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes, you.

363
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,720
Hey, don't you know the number you call for emergency crimes?

364
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,160
You think I'm your bodyguard?

365
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,400
Or your guardian?

366
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,680
You call me every time you cause trouble. You jerk.

367
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,160
Don't laugh. Damn it.

368
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Ugh, but the speed dial on No. 2 is faster.

369
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,800
And this time, I didn't cause trouble.

370
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,600
This time, I saved her.

371
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
Ah, right.

372
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,440
Wow, this is so awkward, you know.

373
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,000
By the way, who is she? Your friend?

374
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,040
Ah, the girl who reported me for being a pervert.

375
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,640
But I heard that the culprit has been caught.

376
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
What the heck? Why are you following her around?

377
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm not following her around.

378
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,400
She transferred to my class a few days ago.

379
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
- Transferred? - Yes.

380
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,040
And she moved to the rooftop next door.

381
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,000
She's in your class, and she lives next door?

382
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,040
Hey, this can't be called a coincidence.

383
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,800
This is more like fate.

384
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
So much for fate.

385
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,320
Ugh, don't go overboard.

386
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,080
Until Ahn finds someone whom he really wishes to

387
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,840
perform psychometry on.

388
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
Who is that someone?

389
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,920
I'm sure he already met that someone by now.

390
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Oh, hey, I have to go back. See you later.

391
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Thank you.

392
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,400
How did you come here?

393
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I saw him following you from school.

394
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,400
Ah.

395
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,040
You know that this is the time to thank me, right?

396
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,000
If this moment passes, it'll get awkward.

397
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,800
Oh, wow.

398
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,400
I got to thank you when there's no one around, again.

399
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,200
Do you work here?

400
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,440
- Yeah. - And a secret too, right?

401
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,040
Why do you keep on finding out my secrets? This is annoying.

402
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm so thankful to you I'm frustrated.

403
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,120
(Fruits Candy)

404
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Here.

405
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,560
Get something to put under it. Under it! Quickly!

406
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Stop exaggerating.

407
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,040
It's still hot.

408
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,520
Wow, it's hot.

409
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
Wait. We need kimchi.

410
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
Ah, looks delicious.

411
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,400
Hey, my dad told me to write down SNU here.

412
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
He said that since I can't get in anywhere anyway,

413
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,000
he'll tell people that I, his son, didn't get into SNU.

414
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,200
Ouch, it't hot.

415
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,960
Then, should I write down Korean National Police University?

416
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,000
Hey, it's not impossible for you.

417
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,920
Your fingers are good enough to get a grade rank of 15.

418
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,440
Are they?

419
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,960
Your father was a police officer, right? Then it's perfect.

420
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,680
Become a police officer officially,

421
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,280
and co-investigate with your prosecutor "brother" and Ji-soo.

422
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,360
Pow! Catch the culprit. Pow! Write down Police University.

423
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah, Sung-mo would be so happy.

424
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,640
He'll totally find out if I pass by cheating.

425
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,400
Hey, then study for real.

426
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,640
I think I should.

427
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,680
Since studying is the easiest thing.

428
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,160
I've got beaten up so much, so it really hurts.

429
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,400
- Hey. - Huh?

430
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,600
Are you sure about not going to college?

431
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,600
Hey, my family owns eight gas stations,

432
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,200
so why should I go to college? Huh?

433
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,680
Why do you think I don't run away from my house

434
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,080
even if my dad beats me up?

435
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,680
I envy you. You're born with a gasoline spoon.

436
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,000
Ah, he's supposed to be here already.

437
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,000
The caller cannot be reached. Please leave a message??

438
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,120
- He's not answering. - Really?

439
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,440
Hello, this is Detective Eun Ji-soo.

440
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Yes.

441
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
What?

442
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,880
Okay, I see.

443
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
What happened?

444
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,280
Ahn's friend almost suffered a hydrochloric acid attack.

445
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,960
"Almost suffered" means that it ended as an attempt,

446
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,640
so the call must be about the suspect being released.

447
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
Yes.

448
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,520
But the victim is

449
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,520
a schoolgirl named Yoon Jae-in.

450
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
It's her, isn't it?

451
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,280
She's the one you talked about, right?

452
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
The one you wanted Ahn to meet.

453
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,720
Where is she right now?

454
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,720
Welcome.

455
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,520
Hi.

456
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,480
About the teacher who tried to attack you earlier.

457
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,040
It was his first offense, his identity is clear,

458
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,960
and it ended as an attempt, so he has been released.

459
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,880
So even if you sue him,

460
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,920
the investigation will be held without detention.

461
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,800
I did expect that to happen.

462
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,080
So you have to be careful for a while.

463
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,600
What did your parents say?

464
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,400
I don't have parents. They passed away.

465
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,080
Oh, really?

466
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,760
Uh, then what should I do?

467
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Do you have any other guardian?

468
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,920
I will be her guardian for a while.

469
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,080
That makes no sense.

470
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,520
You're so busy you can't even go home.

471
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,160
And you think you can protect her? No way.

472
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't worry.

473
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,200
I can take care of myself.

474
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,040
Thank you for worrying about me

475
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,920
and explaining to me in person.

476
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,160
You can't take care of yourself. You're only 19 years old.

477
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
Oh, uh??Detective Eun.

478
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,560
Sorry.

479
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,800
Ugh, seriously.

480
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,480
Ugh, I hate things like this.

481
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,360
Remember the jerk who was arrested for dating abuse,

482
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,440
but got released and killed the woman?

483
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,520
As far as I recall, he killed the entire family.

484
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,880
No way??That's too extreme??

485
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,040
You know, that "no way" kind of attitude leads to danger.

486
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,320
Oh, what should we do?

487
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,080
Ah, right. That's the way.

488
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,720
- What? - You be her bodyguard.

489
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,440
Ha, why should I?

490
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,080
Hey, same class, and next door.

491
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
And you know how that teacher looks like.

492
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,480
What else do we need?

493
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,240
You really don't have to.

494
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,520
Do it while we ask you nicely.

495
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,360
If you don't, I'm taking you to the autopsy room again.

496
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,080
What the heck?

497
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,000
I heard that.

498
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,280
Anyway, things have been wrapped up, right?

499
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,840
You really don't have to do this.

500
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,640
No, you must never ignore cases like this.

501
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,200
If a drop of hydrochloric acid hit your pretty face??

502
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,840
Anyway, use Ahn as much as you want.

503
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,560
He doesn't even study, anyway.

504
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,040
Uh, he is my "brother," so shouldn't you get my permission?

505
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,120
Technically, he's your housemate.

506
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,200
He's my non-biological "brother" as well, you know.

507
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,920
Jae-in. I'm sorry I'm late.

508
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,080
- Are you going home? - Yes.

509
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,160
Good. I'll take you home.

510
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,880
I keep being indebted to you.

511
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,640
How many part-time jobs do you have?

512
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,560
Three?

513
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,600
I have CSAT coming soon, so I cut some down.

514
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,960
The Father told me that you're a smart student.

515
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,160
And that you want to be a judge or a prosecutor.

516
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
Is it because of your father?

517
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,320
So you can prove his innocence?

518
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
What?

519
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,880
Shall I just act like I do not know about this?

520
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,640
If you say so, I will go on and

521
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,400
change the topic naturally.

522
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,240
Yes, could you please do so?

523
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,040
What should I talk about??

524
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,920
Is that detective your girlfriend?

525
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
Ah??

526
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,320
It seemed that you didn't have anything to talk about,

527
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,360
so I just brought it out in a hurry??

528
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
She's my colleague and a friend.

529
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,880
We've known each other since we were very young.

530
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
I think she is awesome.

531
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Well, she doesn't filter out anything.

532
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,520
She's honest, and straightforward.

533
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
Thank you.

534
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,840
For supporting me, even if you knew everything about me.

535
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,040
Do you think your father is the culprit?

536
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,040
Hey, what are you doing out here?

537
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,960
Oh!

538
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
Oh, you're him, right?

539
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,200
The one??from the news.

540
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,240
The prosecutor in charge of the fire case.

541
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,600
Jae-in's Daddy-Long-Legs.

542
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Let's go in, Auntie.

543
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,640
Oh, my.

544
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
Hi. I finally got to say hi.

545
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,840
- Thank you so much. - Sure.

546
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,640
But you see??You look even better in real life than on TV.

547
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
You're just so handsome.

548
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,720
I will treat you to a meal sometime.

549
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,000
Uh, please come inside and have a cup of coffee.

550
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,240
No, Auntie, it't okay.

551
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Or you can come inside and have some ramen.

552
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm sorry. Go in.

553
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,120
See you next time, Prosecutor.

554
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,760
Yes. Goodbye.

555
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,320
(The Mask: A Man with Two Faces)

556
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,680
How can anyone be that handsome?

557
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,840
- He's my type of guy. - Go in. Now.

558
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,480
He's so charming.

559
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Hello?

560
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
What?

561
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,280
This is Gangwon Provincial Police Agency.

562
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,520
Do you know who Mr. Kim Gap-yong is?

563
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,080
What happened?

564
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,120
Just as I told you on the phone.

565
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,280
We need to see if this was out of grudge or robbery,

566
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,040
but I found you, Prosecutor Kang, on the call logs,

567
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,480
so I called you first.

568
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,640
(Call Logs)

569
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,720
It seems that he was attacked on his way to meet us.

570
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
Did you check what this number is?

571
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,720
Ah, that number didn't answer, no matter how many times I called.

572
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,160
We have to start looking into it.

573
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,520
Isn't this chain weird?

574
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,320
It wasn't used to tie his legs onto something,

575
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,760
and it doesn't seem like it was for tying his feet, either.

576
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
So I don't know why the chain is on him.

577
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,120
Like the culprit wanted someone to see him.

578
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
The culprit is

579
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
challenging us.

580
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,960
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

581
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,280
What the heck?

582
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,880
Are you??really going to be my bodyguard?

583
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
Prosecutor Kang!

584
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,240
Prosecutor Kang!

585
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,360
What's wrong, Prosecutor Kang?

586
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,040
(10 cm punctured wound on right abdomen, ruptured abdominal aorta)

587
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,480
We need to re-investigate from the very beginning.

588
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,960
The culprit behind the fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital

589
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,600
wasn't Song Hee-jeong

590
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,080
Someone else started the fire.

591
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
Who?

592
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,040
The one who killed Kim Gap-yong.

593
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
Who is that?

594
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,080
(Fire and murder case at Yeongseong Apartments)

595
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Are you saying that the culprit behind the fire at Hanmin

596
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,440
Nursing Hospital is related to the fire at Yeongseong Apartments?

597
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,240
Prosecutor Kang, you know something, don't you?

598
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,800
Don't you?

599
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Yoon Jae-in.

600
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,520
This is the uniform of Seonyeon High School, right?

601
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,960
Which is located in the city of Uiyeong, Gyeonggi-do.

602
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
What?

603
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,560
It is.

604
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,240
We can search for images these days,

605
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,440
so there are no secrets.

606
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,080
Why did you transfer to so many different schools?

607
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,000
Your dad isn't even running for office, either.

608
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,000
CSAT is coming soon. Leave me alone.

609
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,080
Wow, look at her eyes glowing red.

610
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,400
There is something for sure.

611
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,080
Get out.

612
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,400
It's only a matter of time until we find out.

613
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
Hey, her dad killed people, right?

614
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Wow, he didn't kill just one or two.

615
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,040
Ugh, it's so cruel. It gives me shivers.

616
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,120
How would it feel like to have a murderer as a dad?

617
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,360
- Life sentence? - It'll be better to just die.

618
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
Why? Shouldn't they kill him, too?

619
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,600
I heard that he stabbed people and started a fire.

620
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,400
No way. So many people died.

621
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
Ugh, it's so cruel. It gives me goosebumps.

622
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,080
Life sentence? No way.

623
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,160
Like father, like daughter. She must be the same.

624
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,880
And that you want to be a judge or a prosecutor.

625
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,800
Is it because of your father?

626
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
So you can prove his innocence?

627
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,800
What if your dad really did it?

628
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,840
Her father killed people.

629
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,480
It's so horrible.

630
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,200
How shameless.

631
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
You should die too!

632
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,720
Do you think your father is the culprit?

633
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,920
Are you okay?

634
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,480
It's hyperventilation.

635
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,080
If I breathe too fast out of anxiety,

636
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,440
the level of carbon dioxide in my blood drops.

637
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,440
So, does it get better if you breathe into a bag?

638
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Yes. I'm re-inhaling the carbon dioxide I exhaled.

639
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't know what it is, but I can tell that it's bad.

640
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,400
Does that happen often?

641
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,560
It happens sometimes, when I'm overly stressed.

642
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,160
If you're carrying that bag all the time,

643
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,800
I don't think it happens "sometimes."

644
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,560
I act like the toughest girl in the world,

645
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,320
but my mind is so fragile, isn't it?

646
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,520
I have to hold on until CSAT.

647
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,320
Going to SNU won't cure it.

648
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,760
I need something to protect me. I need at least one thing.

649
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,680
I have neither parents nor someone to watch my back.

650
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,040
I held on with the title of the top student at school,

651
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,360
but if people find out that I'm a beggar-like girl who lives??

652
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
on a rooftop,

653
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,160
then I lose all of my defensive powers.

654
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,080
I can't even stand still.

655
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,480
It must be ridiculous to you, though.

656
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,720
It's not ridiculous. It's the same for me as well.

657
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,520
I have neither parents nor someone to watch my back,

658
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,040
and the only thing that can protect me

659
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,400
is this horrible power of mine.

660
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,560
You have a "brother."

661
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,480
A competent "brother."

662
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,080
That "brother"

663
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,160
abandoned me at the orphanage and left without a word.

664
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,840
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,680
Why are you sorry?

666
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,120
You're going to come back.

667
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,720
You're going to come and see me.

668
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,240
If any of you mess with me, I will kill all of you.

669
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,320
(Please take her)

670
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,040
You're abandoned.

671
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,800
Me, too.

672
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,640
Are you alone?

673
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,520
Oh, me, too.

674
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,600
Is your name White Snow?

675
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,760
Ah, you do look like snow.

676
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,480
Ah, sorry.

677
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,920
I touched you, and??

678
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,600
When I touch people,

679
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,240
they all

680
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,160
leave me.

681
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,840
Want to go home

682
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,400
with me?

683
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,360
I'm here to take you.

684
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm not too late, am I?

685
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,760
I've missed you so much, Sung-mo.

686
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,240
I can never know what my "brother" is thinking.

687
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,560
He's the only one whom my psychometry doesn't work on.

688
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,640
I heard that he had something very important.

689
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,760
Ugh, anyway, I didn't know and just blamed him a lot.

690
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,400
So did you think your "brother" left you because of

691
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,600
that weird power of yours?

692
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,480
I was full of resentment.

693
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,720
I blamed Sung-mo,

694
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,120
and my power.

695
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,640
But I don't do that anymore.

696
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,160
After meeting Sung-mo again, I decided to embrace my power.

697
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,080
By the way, why are you telling me this story?

698
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,600
Isn't that a secret, too?

699
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,840
So you can tell me about your father now.

700
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,960
I will listen.

701
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,600
You can't run away forever.

702
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,160
Working, studying, and running away.

703
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Aren't you tired?

704
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,040
I am tired.

705
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm tired to death.

706
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,800
Perhaps it's not a false charge. Perhaps he really is the culprit??

707
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,960
So??

708
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,840
So I'm scared.

709
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
That's why I can't ask you that favor right away.

710
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,160
I'm not confident about this.

711
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,040
Even if

712
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,080
your father did wrong, it's not your fault.

713
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,880
But the world doesn't think so.

714
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,920
Why do you even care about the world?

715
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,160
Only those you like need to have the right idea about it.

716
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,000
I'll help you.

717
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,120
Not now,

718
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,560
but when you're ready.

719
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,920
Ugh.

720
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,000
Damn it, I'm late.

721
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,640
Damn it.

722
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,240
Woah, what the heck is this?

723
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,080
Lee Ahn. Lee Ahn.

724
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,920
It't a disaster.

725
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,200
If this is about So-hyun again, then I'm going to destroy you.

726
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,560
It's about Yoon Jae-in.

727
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,160
- What is this? - It's about Yoon Jae-in.

728
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,160
- This is just crazy. - What? Yoon Jae-in?

(Yoon Jae-in, the daughter of the murderer)

730

What on earth is this about?

731
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,080
I will reveal your true self to the entire world, got it?

732
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,480
What are you looking at? Scram!

733
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,560
I'm tired.

734
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,760
(Yoon Jae-in, the daughter of the murderer)

735
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,080
I'm tired to death.

736
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,880
Perhaps it's not a false charge. Perhaps he really is the culprit??

737
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,120
I need something to protect me. I need at least one thing.

738
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,280
I have neither parents nor someone to watch my back.

739
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,120
I held on with the title of the top student at school,

740
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,240
but if people find out that I'm a beggar-like girl who lives??

741
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,800
on a rooftop,

742
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,680
then I lose all of my defensive powers.

743
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,080
I can't even stand still.

744
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,840
Damn it.

745
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
Damn it??

746
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,920
I'll help you.

00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,920
Not now,

Dad!

751
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,000
Is your dad a police officer?

752
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,560
Yes.

753
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,080
Then can you please tell him to release my dad?

754
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,160
My dad isn't a bad guy. He really isn't.

755
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,360
Hey, this can't be called a coincidence.

756
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,920
This is more like fate.

757
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,920

if you do psychometry on me right here, right now,

762
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,480
then I wanted to tell you.

763
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,080
That your words about helping me

764
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,280
gave me strength, even for a moment.

765
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,000
Make your power great and awesome!

766
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,920
If you do, when I'm confident,

767
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,600

I'm sorry.

Uh??You, you see??

774
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,520
The minimum wage is $7.53 per hour,

775
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,680
and you worked five hours per day, except for weekends,

776
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,320
so if I subtract 8 from 31??

777
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,400
- That'd be 23, sir. - Oh, yes.

Oh, yeah, you're smart, yeah.

779
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,160
Uh??That'd be 23 days, yes.

780
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,520
That's 23 days, and if I multiply it by $7.53??

You left it at a repair shop yesterday.

792
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,080
So I took a peek.

793

Wow, this is just too ridiculous.

01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,520
You must tell me a convincing reason why I should

let you borrow my lucky car.

He never even touched books,

but he suddenly went on and said that he will start studying.

But what if he passes? By some slim chance?

If he passes, even by cheating,

810

it would also mean that Ahn's power has improved.

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,720
This is embarrassing, just embarrassing.

822
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,120
I shouldn't see Ahn for a while.

823
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,400
This has to be kept forever.

824
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,360
Ugh, seriously.

825
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,800
(The 2nd 2018 Police Officer Examination for Service)

826
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,280
(Examination for Service Application Form)

827
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,960
Please help me today.

828
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,680
Today's exam depends on you.

829
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,880
(Written Examination Room)

830
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,080
I have no idea??

831
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,040
Ugh, this is hurting my conscience.

832
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,640
I'm sorry.

833
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
You there, stop.

834
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Ah, you see, uh??My hands are numb.

835
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,640
Taking the exam with other methods besides taking it for yourself

836
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
are all considered cheating,

837
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,440
and when you are caught, you'll be expelled immediately.

838
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,280
Found you.

839
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,560
Yoon Jae-in.

840
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,760
(He is Psychometric)

841
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,320
I didn't expect you to become a cop.

842
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,760
You were trying to cheat earlier, right?

843
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,240
Are you helping your prosecutor "brother" and detective "sister?"

844
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,480
I can say that I'm a psychometrist.

845
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,080
Commissioner, do you really think

846
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,320
you can swear to God that you're complete and perfect?

847
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,680
I think a child has been kidnapped.

848
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,840
There really is a piece of luggage with a dead body in it.

849
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,000
Hey, Kang Sung-mo.

850
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,760
Why do you have so many secrets?

851
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,440
Some jerk stalked you starting from our house.

852
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,000
I approached him, and he ran away.
