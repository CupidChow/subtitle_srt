2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,360
(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,080
(Dec. 11, 2005: One week after the fire)

4
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,040
If anything happens, call me.

5
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
I will run to you.

6
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Here's a puppy! Woof, woof.

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,080
Dad will do everything for you, except for the puppy.

8
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Dad!

9
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,760
Why did you commit murder?

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
What's the reason?

11
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,840
Dad!

12
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,560
If so, how long are you going to just stand there and watch Ahn?

13
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,640
Until Ahn finds someone whom he really wishes to

14
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,000
perform psychometry on.

15
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,160
I, too, have someone I wish Ahn could

16
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,200
perform psychometry on.

17
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,040
Who is that someone?

18
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,960
I'm sure he already met that someone

19
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
by now.

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
(PSYCHOMETRY)

21
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,840
(PSYCHOMETRY A combination of Greek words)

22
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
(PSYCHE, Soul and METRON, Measuring)

23
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
(An ability to measure the soul of a person or)

24
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,200
(an object and interpreting it)

25
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,240
(He is Psychometric)

26
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
(Episode 2)

27
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,240
Hey, why didn't you go to your school yet?

28
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm sorry, but I heard that this school

29
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,040
won't be your school anymore starting tomorrow.

30
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,160
You're getting expelled, aren't you?

31
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Expelled? Says who?

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
I was concerned about continuing to see you,

33
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,240
but I'm glad that you're being expelled.

34
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,200
I transferred here, and I am assigned to your homeroom class.

35
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,280
What?

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,960
Don't follow me. If you touch me, I'll scream.

37
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,640
Hey, I don't like touching people

38
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
and things like that.

39
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm Lee Ahn. No one can expel me.

40
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,760
Why? What are you looking at?

41
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm studying psychology and profiling these days,

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,040
and boys at our age have two types of worries.

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
- What? - One's about

44
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
grades.

45
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,520
And the other's about sexual things.

46
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,240
I have good sense of hearing,

47
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,480
and what did I just hear?

48
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
Grades,

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,040
and sexual things.

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Sexual??Okay.

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,640
And worries never come in a perfect 5 to 5 ratio.

52
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
It's usually one-sided.

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,040
You're so randomly boastful.

54
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
What do you mean?

55
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,000
You've been involved in both kinds of cases.

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,040
An academic case and a sexual case.

57
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
Which one is the real you?

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Neither. Neither of them.

59
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,680
Do you know how it feels to be framed all day long?

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,080
Do you know how unfair it is for me?

61
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,160
Framed?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,160
Unfair?

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
I totally know how it is. That's the problem.

64
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,200
Ah! What's with her?

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240
I thought about it seriously as your friend,

66
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,840
but clearing your charges as a pervert isn't urgent.

67
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Yes, expulsion is serious, too.

68
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Why were the answers from that guy so clear??

69
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,040
No, what's urgent is??

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,080
This is So-hyun's, so do psychometry on this.

71
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
So-hyun left early, you see.

72
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
What are her concerns these days?

73
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
Is she trying to find the right time to ask me out?

74
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
Find those things out.

75
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
Do I look free to you?

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,080
Here, look into it after you get expelled and have time.

77
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Hey.

78
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
- What? - How about we do this?

79
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
I will do psychometry on that new girl.

80
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,600
And I will check the characteristics of the pervert

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,560
in the restroom and find him.

82
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,200
By the way, you will do psychometry on her

83
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
and catch the pervert on your own?

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,360
Right.

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,560
So you'll touch the girl who thinks of you as a pervert?

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Yes!

87
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
You still don't get what's weird about this, huh?

88
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,360
- No. - You're such an idiot.

89
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Same goes for you??

90
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,600
Ugh, if you got it wrong, try and solve it again,

91
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
you bunch of stupid, idiotic kids.

92
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
Go back in.

93
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,840
Hey, new girl, I heard that you're quite smart.

94
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Want to come out and solve it?

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,160
Wow, I knew it.

96
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,640
This is the dignity of the student aiming to enter SNU.

97
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
Watch and learn, you trashy??

98
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,080
Ugh, you won't even understand, anyway.

99
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,080
You said that you want to be a prosecutor, huh?

100
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,640
If I can.

101
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,960
Is your father the one who's running for the election??

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, the words have spread already.

103
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,120
Look, you bastards.

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,640
About how different she is from all of you??Okay?

105
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,960
Those who are well-educated at home and study hard

106
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
are different in many ways.

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
Those with single fathers or single mothers,

108
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
and we even have an orphan now??

109
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,160
I don't know what to do with

110
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,640
stupid, idiotic kids like you guys??

111
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,800
I think I solved it wrong.

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,720
- What? - I solved it like this,

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
because it seemed that you wanted this answer, but??

114
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
So?

115
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,520
The proposition stating that the sum of three vectors

116
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,800
is either bigger than or equal to the sum of the two vectors

117
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
means that it is valid even though the remaining vector

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,480
is in any size or direction,

119
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,160
but if Z is 0, then this presupposition is an error.

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,920
Quiet!

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You solved it well, and you say that it's an error??

122
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Hey, this is the correct answer. Go back to your seat.

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,800
This problem is just like you.

124
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,200
- What? - "Troublemakers aren't educated,

125
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
and since he jumped over a wall and did well on the exams,

126
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,960
so it has to be him who broke into the teachers' office."

127
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,320
It's quite similar in that you choose the answer that is wanted.

128
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Hey, new girl! I coddled you and now you're walking all over me.

129
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
He couldn't tell who the math teacher or chemistry teacher was

130
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,160
until he entered the teachers' office.

131
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,880
Isn't it weird that such a guy stole exam questions

132
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
for every single subject?

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Cheating by looking at someone else's answers is wrong,

134
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,800
but did you compare the answers of the guy who was

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,320
in front of him with his answers

136
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,840
before questioning him?

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
Hey!

138
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,200
You little??

139
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
What is this behavior? Huh?

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
I hate to defend that guy,

141
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
but insulting and condemning us as a whole

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
doesn't seem like something a teacher should do.

143
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,080
She's nuts.

144
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Stop!

145
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
I said, stop!

146
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
If he's not the culprit, then who is?

147
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,760
Someone broke the lock and broke into the teachers' office.

148
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
And you say that he's not the culprit?

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey, you said that you will become a prosecutor, huh?

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,560
When you're attending a trial at court,

151
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,520
the best way to prove someone innocent

152
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,080
is to find the real culprit.

153
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,800
So I'm going to find the real one.

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,240
- You? - Yes. If so, will you apologize?

155
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,520
About being stupid, idiotic kids, single parents and orphans??

156
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,080
You must apologize for insulting us as a whole.

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh!

158
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
And give us back the phones you seized, too.

159
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,240
And the comic books, too.

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,280
Mine, too??

161
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,000
Give them back! Give them back!

162
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Give them back!

163
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,800
Shut up, you bastards!

164
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
What will you do if you can't find the real one?

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
Then you can do as you wish.

166
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
- Do as I wish? - Yes.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,120
Either expel me or whatever??

168
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,760
Oh, I can't expel a student aiming for SNU??

169
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm just a math teacher.

170
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Then I'll leave the school.

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Voluntarily?

172
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Okay.

173
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,320
The deadline is the next math class.

174
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Find out the real culprit by then.

175
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
That's it for now!

176
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,920
Hey, hey.

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,280
Wow, you're awesome.

178
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,840
Hey, but the next math class is 1st period tomorrow.

179
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,800
Good luck.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,200
I meddled, again.

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,120
Ah, this natural nosiness of mine!

182
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I wanted to live a quiet life here! I must've gone nuts!

183
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,840
Leave the school?

184
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,160
I've been maintaining good grades with all of my energy??

185
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm nuts, totally nuts??

(Girls' Restroom)

187
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
Stop.

188
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,280
You like me, don't you?

189
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,000
Did you transfer to this school because I go to this one?

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,160
Ah, I'm just too popular.

191
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,040
I was agitated because of the math teacher and forgot you.

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,480
If this was going to save you,

193
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,640
I shouldn't have stood up to him,

194
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,120
even if the Earth was about to explode??

195
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,920
Now I can understand you,

196
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,240
about why you accused me as a pervert??

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,480
You were so impressive.

198
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,320
How successful!

199
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,800
It's not because of you. When I see people like that,

200
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,080
I break out into hives and I can't breathe.

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,240
I didn't want to help you at all, so mind your own business.

202
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,680
Alright, fine.

203
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,520
I'll help you.

204
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,160
I'll help you find the one who broke into the teachers' office.

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,200
Hey, say it correctly.

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,680
I am helping you, instead of you helping me.

207
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,560
I'm Lee Ahn.

208
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
If??If so??

209
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,480
Let's do this after I catch the culprit.

210
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,720
Do what?

211
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,000
The handshake.

212
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Hold hands for 3 seconds, no more, no less.

213
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,600
Okay?

214
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,400
A handshake for 3 seconds?

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
He is totally nuts for sure.

216
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,080
Ugh, Jae-in will be here soon, and??

217
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Where should I hide this?

218
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,040
Should I hide it here? Here??

219
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,080
She will find it soon??

220
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,720
Where should I??This is driving me nuts.

221
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,280
Let's do this??Hi, Jae-in.

222
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,040
This is too awkward.

223
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
Let's bury it underground instead.

224
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Oh, my, oh.

225
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,520
Hi, Jae-in.

226
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
Oh, wow, do you know how much that is?

227
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,040
How can you spit candy in it??

228
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,800
Right, it's been less than a week since I bought the

229
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,360
luxurious handkerchief set and got criticized by you, right?

230
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,520
I do know that, but Jae-in.

231
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,320
Jae-in, this, this is really cheap.

232
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,080
This costs $6,000 originally. It's quite pricey.

233
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
But, don't get surprised.

234
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,360
I asked for half off the price, and bought it for $3,000.

235
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,760
This will be worth a lot someday if we keep it.

236
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,920
It's hard to find this in Korea.

237
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,000
You just can't find this.

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
$3,000 is practically nothing. It's half the price.

239
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,040
Jae-in. Jae-in. Please.

240
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,200
Please, Jae-in.

241
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,840
I'm having fun with investments thanks to you, Auntie.

242

You little??Hey, you??

243
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,160
Oh, I already have a purchaser.

244
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Already?

245
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
- But I tried hard to get this??- Yes, Father.

246
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,160
Our move went well, thanks to you.

247
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,640

248
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,040
Your sponsor worked so hard.

249
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,440
This person paid donations every month for 3 years,

250
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,200
and even found the place and the school,

251
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,160
so I don't know how to repay??

252
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
Uh, can you please ask once more?

253
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,800
That I really wish to meet this person.

254
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,040
You get rejected every time, and you still say that.

255
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,680
If so, I will go ahead and let this person know

256
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,840
that you really want to meet them.

257

Are you coming late again?

260
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
Come on, why are you late again, when you caught the culprit?

261
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,120
Do you have another "brother" besides me these days?

262
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
There are times you come late when you have a job.

263
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,760
What? Do you have something to say to me?

264
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,960
You know, Sung-mo, by any chance, if I??

265
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,360
Even if I get expelled or become an ex-convict,

266
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
you'll still see me, right?

267
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,560
If so, I will never see you again. Until I die.

268
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
What if I didn't do it and have been framed??

269
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,040
What I mean is, if it was a false charge?

270
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Even if the world is wrong, and I didn't do anything wrong?

271
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
Looks like you're imagining something like me never

272
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
turning my back on you, but I will be the 1st one to do so.

273

Hey, you can't be more pathetic than this,

274
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,520
so I can't watch you being even more pathetic, okay?

275
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
Did you practice and memorize that? Like a rap?

276
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,040
Hey, expulsion is one thing, but what's the ex-convict thing?

Are you hanging out with your old friends?

278

It's just about imagining the worst-case scenario.

279

Don't. Because you always go beyond the imagination.

Uh, you see??

295
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,120
I thought you were brainless,

296
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,440
but you saw the passcode beforehand. How unusual.

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Pervert! Why is your nose bleeding when you hurt your hand?

331
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,480
This happens sometimes when I'm focused.

332
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,880
You crazy pervert.

333
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,840
Ugh, damn it, that's not what it is.

334
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,560
Don't come near me, you damn pervert.

335
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,560
I just felt something for sure??

336
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,760
(Student Grade Ranking from Midterm, Seniors)

337
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,560
This is ridiculous.

338
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,600
Ow!

339
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,960
Uh, I just??Uh??

340
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,080
You did copy the answers from the guy in front of you.

341
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,960
How could you even copy the wrong essay answers, too?

342
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,840
I told you.

343
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,840
Cheating? Yes. Breaking into the teachers' office? No. Okay?

344
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,040
I am amazed by my own power, you know.

345
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,760
So, you see??

346
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,600
I thought about it.

347
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,400
Perhaps the culprit didn't enter the teachers' office

348
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,200
for exam questions, but for something else.

349
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,440
What?

350
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,360
Well, uh??I suddenly thought so.

351
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,920
What if it was to get back the thing seized by the math teacher?

352
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,280
To imagine specifically,

353
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,000
like a yellow purse containing cigarettes.

354
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
Breaking into the teachers' office the day before the exams

355
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,120
to retrieve the seized cigarettes?

356
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,080
Or like a pen he must have

357
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,600
to do well on the exams.

358
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,560
Is that pen the One Ring or something?

359
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,000
To make it worthy enough to break into the teachers' office?

360
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,920
Just go and read "HOTLADY."

361
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,080
Wow, just listen to the way you talk.

362
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,760
Her name is Kang Hee-sook, and she's 57 years old.

363
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm sure that she is the woman Ahn saw.

364
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,040
She was on duty that day,

365
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,360
and she was in charge of the patients in #701.

366
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,560
But after the fire, she's out of reach.

367
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
If she escaped, she should've at least

368
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
testified about the situation for it to make sense.

369
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,720
But she's out of reach??

370
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,160
I know, right? Isn't it suspicious?

371
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,040
Are you thinking that this woman is the accomplice

372
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,200
of the arson case?

373
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,280
No, that's a little too extreme.

374
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
But it's too bothersome to just let it pass.

375
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,000
Everyone's eager to make the hospital compensate

376
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
with money for mental shock from the fire and other things.

377
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,040
But it is weird that she disappeared.

378
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,360
Ah, the office apartment in front of the hospital

379
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,840
is her residential address, so I'm going there.

380
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Want to come with me?

381
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,840
No, but please call me if you meet Kang Hee-sook.

382
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,640
I have someone waiting, who really wants to see me??

383
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Okay.

384
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,280
Hey, go sleep at your house.

385
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,640
It bothers me.

386
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,880
Black cap, black clothes.

(Grade Ranking of the Entire School (for viewing))

388
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,600
Yellow purse, girl.

389
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,840
Okay, so no one stole the exam questions from the beginning.

390
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,000
Now, game over.

391
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
What on earth are you saying?

392
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,160
I overexerted myself today.

393
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Ugh, I'm dizzy.

394
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,200
Hey, do you have any candy?

395
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,880
So much for candy. Just go.

396
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,000
I can't afford to be expelled, though it not serious for you.

397
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't afford to be expelled, either.

398
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,920
Ugh, damn it.

399
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Shh.

400
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,280
3145?

401
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,160
He's gone. Let's go home now.

402
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
What are you?

403
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,720
- What? - You just said 3145.

404
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,360
Did you fall asleep?

405
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,880
I said nothing.

406
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,640
Let go.

407
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,560
Ugh, I'm starving.

408
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm leaving.

409
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
Why did I say that out loud?

410
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,960
Why is she so sensitive about 3145, anyway?

411
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,040
That's enough staring.

412
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,840
I don't want to forget how she looks.

413
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,120
How did the parole review go?

414
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,600
Well??Even if you're a model prisoner, you spent only 11 years.

415
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,760
So parole isn't really suitable.

416
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,480
Right?

417
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,080
I didn't mishear it.

418
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,760
He said 3145 for sure??

419
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,400
How did he??

420
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,000
Excuse me?

421
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Excuse me.

422
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,400
Are you Yoon Jae-in?

423
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,560
Do you know me?

424
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
Maybe?

425
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,040
Who are you?

426
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,400
You said that you want to see me, right?

427
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,400
What the heck?

428
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
Who are you?

429
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,160
Ah, uh??I heard it from the Father.

430
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,240
That you really want to see me.

431
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,040
If so, I will go ahead and let this person know

432
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,680
that you really want to meet them.

433
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,840
Ah.

434
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,320
Ah.

435
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
Were you startled?

436
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,320
Ah, yes, I didn't expect you to be so young,

437
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,240
and I didn't think that you'd suddenly show up.

438
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,000
Ah, actually, I live in the house across that rooftop room.

439
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,200
I, too, am struggling, so??

440
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,360
But you donated money to support me.

441
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
I will pay back the money you sent me someday.

442
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,720
I will receive the repayment in a different form rather than money.

443
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,320
What form?

444
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
With you being happy.

445
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Ah.

446
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,840
But paying you back with money is better??

447
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
Alright then, you may do so.

448
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,480
By the way, we have met before, haven't we?

449
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,160
Ah, that's something you say when you're flirting.

450
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,880
No, I mean, you do look familiar.

451
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh, you're the prosecutor in charge of the hospital fire, right?

452
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,920
I saw you on the news.

453
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,720
- And? - Huh?

454
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,000
"I saw you on TV. You were amazing.

455
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,920
You look way better in real life."

456
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,120
Usually sentences like these follow as options.

457
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Ah.

458
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,160
Ugh.

459
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
I was trying to make you laugh.

460
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,520
I learn other things via reading,

461
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,120
but I can't learn about jokes via reading.

462
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,280
Ha!

463
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,680
I'm sure it was a girl.

464
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
(Dae-bong)

465
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,680
The teachers' office invader was a girl? Is she pretty?

466
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,320
I do have a twist of not seeing the highlights.

467
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,600
I didn't see her face,

468
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,160
but she was average height and had a good figure, I guess?

469
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,720
Wow, such wonderful beauties aren't common at our school.

470
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,360
By the way, about the new girl.

471
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
What about the new girl?

472
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,160
She was searching for all of the report cards, then and now,

473
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,760
and was investigating those who got better grades.

474
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,800
Is it okay to let her make wrong guesses?

475
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,760
Hey, if so, will you do psychometry on her

476
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,640
and see what kind of figure she has? Huh?

477
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,040
That would totally nail myself as a lunatic, then.

478
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,600
By the way, why does it seem that you're evolving?

479
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,240
How can you read all of the answers on every subject?

480
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
Ugh, my ramen.

481
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,160
I got taller by 10 cm last winter.

482
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Sung-mo said that psychometry might be??Um??

483
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,000
Proportional to my physical growth.

484
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,160
Ah, so physical growth and psychometry are proportional.

485
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
By the way, what does that mean?

486
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,040
Don't get in too deep. Explaining won't help you understand it.

487
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,080
Hey! It's not like I can't explain because I don't know about it.

488
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,160
Just go to sleep, you jerk.

489
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Sung-mo!

490
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,120
Come inside if you're done. Why are you out here?

491
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
What do you think I did?

492
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Ugh.

493
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,240
Ugh, it's a total mystery. I can't see anything.

494
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,040
You're the most invincible human being I know.

495
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,400
You still need more training.

496
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,560
No, no.

497
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,840
I think you

498
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,240
don't have any noradrenalin.

499
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,000
What?

500
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,080
Don't you remember?

501
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
(11 years ago)

502
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Wake up and stay focused.

503
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,080
If you cry, they will look down on you and bully you more.

504
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,960
Sung-mo, the kids call me a freak.

505
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,000
But they are even worse freaks.

506
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,880
They do bad things secretly.

507
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,360
I saw everything.

508
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,040
Why do you have to say that you're seeing those things?

509
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,800
Do you think I'm lying, too?

510
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,920
No. I believe you.

511
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,080
But neither they nor you are freaks.

512
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
It's all because of noradrenalin.

513
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
Nor what?

514
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,360
Noradrenalin translates bad emotions

515
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,120
in the brain into memories.

516
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,200
So, in people's memories, bad memories last longer

517
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
than good memories.

518
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,640
It's not because humans are bad or are freaks.

519
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,480
It's just that bad memories last longer, and you see them.

520
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,640
Why am I seeing them? I don't want to see them.

521
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,160
I think it's a relief that you can see them.

522
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,440
I tried to eat one more roll of kimbap secretly,

523
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,200
but I didn't, because I thought you might find out.

524
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
Really?

525
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,160
But I can't see anything from you, anyway.

526
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,800
That's why we're a perfect team.

527
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,520
If so, don't you feel disgusted if I touch you?

528
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,280
Not at all.

529
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,480
Wow, I never knew you would teach me someday.

530
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Is this when people say it was worth raising a child?

531
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
I raised you,

532
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,400
by watching you and making sure that you don't do bad things.

533
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
You jerk.

534
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,160
Ow. Oh.

535
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,840
Oh, oh, oh.

536
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,120
What? Why?

537
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,520
- A girl. - What?

538
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
A girl!

539
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,480
This is the first time I saw something from you,

540
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,640
and I saw a girl!

541
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,040
Don't provoke me, you jerk.

542
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,680
It's true.

543
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,000
Uh??

544
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,600
Oh, I can't see her. I saw her earlier for sure.

545
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,040
So he was a prosecutor.

546
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,160
(Dohyeon High School)

547
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,920
This is it, right? Your social media account!

548
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,400
You posted about the problem with an error recently.

549
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,080
Why didn't you make an objection to the school

550
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,480
when you knew it was an error?

551
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,200
Are you thinking that I am the culprit?

552
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,840
Let's say that this is an interrogation of a witness.

553
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,000
I just want to know who the top student of this school

554
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,520
is suspecting as the culprit.

555
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,640
I won't say it for free.

556
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,840
So you do know something, huh?

557
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,080
I just got the best grades in the entire school on this exam,

558
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,080
and hate to retake it.

559
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,400
That's the only reason!

560
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
- What about the others? - Others who?

561
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,240
Ah, the ones who got it right?

562
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,080
Well, why couldn't they say that the problem was wrong?

563
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,160
It's not like they're forced to not say anything.

564
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,280
I think one of those who got it right, including you,

565
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
is the culprit.

566
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
Even though it had errors,

567
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
they wrote down the answer the teacher wanted.

568
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,040
Since you made it that far, I must give you a hint.

569
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,400
As a gift.

570
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,080
It's only been a day since you came here, so you might not know,

571
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
but actually, I was the only one

572
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
who could solve that problem with the error at this school.

573
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,640
Until you came here.

574
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,400
What do you mean?

575
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,120
Do you mean that all of those who got it right

576
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,280
are the culprits?

577
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,040
You said you'll leave school if you don't catch the culprit.

578
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,680
It's beneficial for me when you can't catch the culprit.

579
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,920
Wait, so, the culprit is a girl who owns a pink pen

580
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,480
and a yellow purse in which she carries cigarettes,

581
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,400
and this is the only way to catch her?

582
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,520
Yes, we have 30 minutes until the class begins.

583
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,560
I have no time to do psychometry on all of the girls at school.

584
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,080
No, but this isn't right.

585
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,120
You might die from this.

586
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,720
Let's survive and meet again.

587
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Hey, what the heck?

588
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,840
Move!

589
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,080
Get out of the way! Damn it!

590
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
Come out!

591
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,520
So-hyun! So-hyun, don't mind it! Ahn pressed it.

592
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,720
By the way, So-hyun??

593
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,400
I need to talk to you.

594
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,120
What's wrong with him?

595
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,880
What's wrong with him?

596
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,640
- Get up, you bastard. - Wipe your nose, you bastard.

597
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,560
Ugh.

598
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,120
Oh, I almost died for real.

599
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,800
Did you do this?

600
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,480
Did all the girls come out? That's weird.

601
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,120
Yeah, you're the weirdest jerk at this school.

602
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,160
Ah, right. Cigarette. Do you know by any chance?

603
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,960
A girl who carries cigarettes in a yellow purse!

604
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,960
What?

605
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,440
I'm busy right now.

606
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,880
What do you want?

607
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,400
You??

608
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,000
You're just like your dad.

609
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,560
You just can't stand injustice.

610
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,880
What are you trying to say?

611
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,840
Why did you get involved, out of all those people?

612
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,600
What?

613
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,800
I,

614
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,440
I have a secret.

615
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,120
I'm going to tell it only to you,

616
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,160
but it's up to you to keep it or not.

617
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,320
I owe you, too, anyway.

618
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,840
What are you talking about? How should I know

619
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,120
all of the heavy smokers at this school?

620
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,000
You borrow cigarettes from the students all the time.

621
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,600
You jerk! How dare you frame me!

622
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,520
Hey, you, give me a cigarette, will you?

623
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,080
It wasn't a pen?

624
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,040
Mr. Hong, you know who it is, right? Who is it?

625
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,400
Hey, where's Kim So-hyun?

626
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,080
Why are you looking for So-hyun?

627
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,600
She left with the new girl earlier.

628
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,720
The new girl?

629
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,760
Did she find out already? Wow.

630
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,800
Why?

631
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,520
Why are you looking for my dear So-hyun?

632
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,120
So-hyun

633
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,040
had her pregnancy test kit in her cigarette purse

634
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,360
when the math teacher seized it.

635
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,000
Hey, you, give me a cigarette, will you?

636
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,160
Hey, you! You little??This is??

637
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,640
Wake up! You're a senior in high school! Got it?

638
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,680
I'm seizing this!

639
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,920
She went into the teachers' office not to have that thing found.

640
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,880
I'm sure you saw something wrong.

641
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,120
I did psychometry on So-hyun's pen you gave me.

642
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,400
You knew that So-hyun was the culprit

643
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,880
as soon as I mentioned the yellow purse.

644
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,000
Is that why she broke up with her boyfriend?

645
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,080
I will kill that bastard!

646
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,640
Hey! Hey! Lee Dae-bong!

647
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,200
Is that true?

648
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,640
I wanted to apologize to you about

649
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,000
my mom making the worst fuss when you got kicked out of town.

650
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,400
Let's just think that it's repaying of the debt.

651
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,360
Let's not talk about that.

652
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
So?

653
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,680
What will you do now?

654
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,080
I wanted to hold out until graduation,

655
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,120
but I guess I can't do that now.

656
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,000
Where did they go?

657
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,160
Go tell the truth to the math teacher. I'm fine.

658
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,160
New girl. Where's Kim So-hyun? I heard she left with you.

659
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,720
She went home.

660
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,400
Did she run away already?

661
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,720
Hey! Did you find out something?

662
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,120
You found out, right? About why she went to the teachers' office?

663
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,240
Hey, let's go to the classroom first. Class will start soon.

664
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,520
Don't tell anybody.

665
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,840
What?

666
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,560
You must never tell the other kids

667
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,520
about why she went into the teachers' office.

668
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,080
If you do, So-hyun will be expelled.

669
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,400
Then what about me? Does that mean it's okay for me to

670
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,520
be expelled? And you, aren't you going to go to college?

671
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,560
There are secrets worthy of keeping, like a life.

672
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,120
Ah, you might not understand, but there is something like that.

673
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,920
It's not that I don't understand.

674
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,400
I do understand, but why do I

675
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,280
have to be expelled because of that?

676
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,280
Ugh.

677
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,440
Ugh, that jerk.

678
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,000
Hey, Lee Dae-bong! Stop it, you jerk!

679
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,960
How could you do that as So-hyun's boyfriend?

680
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,680
Hey, stop him! Stop him!

681
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,840
So, the two who didn't do their homework ran away?

682
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,080
Yoon Jae-in.

683
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,520
You know, I was so curious about

684
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,920
why a smart girl like you was so agitated about

685
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,480
what I said and took action.

686
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,360
So I did some research. Okay?

687
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,000
Wow, you really are incredible.

688
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,320
Having a single parent doesn't even compare.

689
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,360
- Hey, stop him! - Dae-bong! Move!

690
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,040
Ugh, you jerks??

691
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,800
Get your dirty hands off of me!

692
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,680
I'm going to kill you!

693
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,800
Hey, get out of the way!

694
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,080
What should I do?

695
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,680
Did you try to study hard and become a prosecutor

696
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,040
because of your father?

697
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,200
I'm interested in social issues.

698
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,120
I knew your father's name was somewhat familiar, huh?

699
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,240
It's him, right? Yoon Tae??

700
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,200
No student leaked exam questions from the teachers' office.

701
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,360
But, there was a teacher who leaked the exam questions.

702
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,080
- What? - There's someone who saw

703
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,040
the pre-marked answer sheets from the 3rd drawer of yours.

704
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,960
Why were the OMR answer sheets

705
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,320
with the answers pre-marked hidden in your drawer

706
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,360
on the day before the midterm exams?

707
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,720
Five, to be exact.

708
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,560
What on earth are you talking about?

709
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,080
Ah, right, I forgot to tell you that names were written on them.

710
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,040
Kim Eun-soo, from Class 3, Rank 13 in the entire school.

711
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,640
Ahn Kyung-soo, Class 2, Rank 14. Han Seol-ah, Class 5, Rank 22. Class 6??

712
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,760
- What nonsense is this? - This

713
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,880
is called "the biter is bit."

714
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,120
The kids who got the problem with an error right.

715
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,240
Those kids and you were the culprits.

716
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,360
Is this gibberish or babbling? I don't know what you're??

717
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,240
I said no, but my mom??

718
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,960
Shut up, you bastard!

719
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I told you to catch the culprit, and you're writing a novel!

720
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,960
Who on earth broke into the teachers' office?

721
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,320
And who saw such ridiculous things in my drawer? Huh?

722
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,040
- That's??- Who is it!

723
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,400
Who said something ridiculous about seeing such things!

724
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,680
It's him.

725
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,560
Yes, it was me!

726
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,800
I broke into the teachers' office.

727
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,480
And I saw everything while stealing

728
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,160
"HOTLADY" from your drawer. Why?

729
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,040
(Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education accuse the teacher)

730
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,600
(who leaked exam questions)

731
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,000
(Exam Questions Leaked at Dohyeon High School)

732
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,160
(This school is Dohyeon High /The math teacher is nuts)

733
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
(They used poor kids as scapegoats /Proof that it's a bad school)

734
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,040
(What a corrupt school. Wow. That school's famous for being bad)

735
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,080
(That's Dohyeon High. It's in front of my house)

736
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,880
Wow, this is crazy.

737
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,200
Ow. Hey.

738
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,480
Hey, hey, let go before you tell me.

739
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,560
Let go first.

740
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,800
I said let go! Hey! Good grief.

741
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,880
I had no chance earlier, so I couldn't ask you,

742
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,040
but about So-hyun??

743
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,240
How did you find that out?

744
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,400
About how So-hyun went into the teachers' office.

745
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,520
And you even knew about her secret.

746
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,600
Someone informed me about that.

747
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,680
Who?

748
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,040
Dae-bong!

749
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,400
- Dae-bong? - Who else can tell me?

750
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,040
He stalks So-hyun.

751
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,080
He knew that she was the culprit,

752
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,440
but he hid it from me. That jerk.

753
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,600
If so,

754
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,800
how much do you know about me?

755
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,440
What would I know about you?

756
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,720
3145, I just have to make sure of that.

757
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,960
What is that?

758
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,040
3145.

759
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,760
You said those numbers in front of the teachers' office that day.

760
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,240
What are those numbers about?

761
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,320
- What? - I don't know, and you're asking.

762
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,120
You tell me! What are those numbers?

763
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,560
Are you saying that I heard things?

764
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,320
Then what are you thinking about

765
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,200
how and what I know about those numbers?

766
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,920
We met recently and don't even know each other well.

767
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,080
And those numbers aren't important to us.

768
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,560
Uh, then??

769
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,560
Let's do this after I catch the teacher's office invader.

770
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,120
Do what?

771
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,000
The handshake.

772
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,160
Hold hands for 3 seconds, no more, no less.

773
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,120
Right??Right now?

774
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,720
Here?

775
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,440
Yes, hello?

776
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,480
Hello?

777
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,640
Ah, yes, you're from the police station.

778
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,200
The culprit was caught on the CCTV camera

779
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,720
inside the arcade.

780
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh, really?

781
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,560
Is he??

782
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,920
He's not the boy you sued.

783
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,400
He's quite infamous in that area,

784
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,080
so catching him is only a matter of time.

785
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,280
Did that boy receive a call, too?

786
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,000
Ah, hello, I'm not the culprit, right?

787
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,120
Wow, haha, wow. Yes, thank you.

788
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,840
Thank you.

789
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,520
Did you hear that?

790
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,200
I'm not the culprit.

791
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,280
You!

792
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,040
But you said that you saw underwear sizes,

793
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,440
and that you'll see it for sure from now on.

794
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,120
What was that phone call about?

795
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,680
That was totally calling for my misunderstandings.

796
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,040
You told me.

797
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,720
There are secrets worthy of

798
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,120
keeping, like a life.

799
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,560
I, too, have one as well.

800
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,920
What the heck are you?

801
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,120
- What? - You're stupid and smart.

802
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,800
You seem like a pervert but you're not.

803
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,400
You're really good at giving insulting compliments.

804
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,640
If that's your apology, then I'll accept it and let it go.

805
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,920
Okay! I apologize for accusing you of being a pervert. I'm sorry.

806
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,680
And thank you.

807
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,800
For keeping the secret about So-hyun.

808
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
Here.

809
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,520
The new girl officially said sorry and thanks,

810
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,640
but nobody's here.

811
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,400
Everybody has to hear this, but nobody's here.

812
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,880
My arm hurts.

813
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,120
Since the pervert is caught too, let's say this is a handshake.

814
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,120
Game over.

815
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,000
(Fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital)

816
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,440
He's just

817
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,800
so handsome, no matter how many times I see him.

818
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,240
How can a prosecutor be that handsome?

819
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,240
If I was like 10 years younger,

820
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,600
I could've said, "come and prosecute me, with love!"

821
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,200
That's him, Auntie!

822
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,840
- Huh? - Who supported us for 3 years.

823
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,040
Oh, oh, wow.

824
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,840
So, that prosecutor is your Daddy-Long-Legs?

825
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,040
He lives next door, so if you see him, say hi.

826
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,480
He lives next door?

827
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,240
Oh, wow.

828
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,240
What the heck? Does he live there? Ugh.

829
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,280
What? Are you coming home or going to work?

830
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,440
I can't come home tonight. I'm here to get changed.

831
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,120
Is it a new case? Can I come?

832
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,160
There you go, again.

833
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Actually, something tiny happened at school,

834
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,840
and I solved it so well.

835
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,280
And you ended up being suspended?

836
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,560
I got a call from school.

837
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,280
Ah, but that's because I solved it on my own.

838
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,080
If not, I could've been expelled.

839
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,440
Sung-mo!

840
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,240
Please trust me this once, okay?

841
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,080
Because that's the only thing

842
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,000
I can do for you.

843
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
I know.

844
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,720
I know that you want to do something for me,

845
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,480
and that you want to help me

846
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,120
with that power of yours.

847
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,120
But I think your power of psychometry

848
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,160
is a bit dangerous for now.

849
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,440
Psychometry?

850
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,120
Your power can see the person who's holding a knife,

851
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,000
but it can't see whom that person stabbed,

852
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,920
or if that person is holding a knife

853
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,360
to cover up someone's sin.

854
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,160
Don't be arrogant about seeing

855
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,360
a few out of thousands of pieces.

856
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,040
Who's there?

857
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,200
Damn it.

858
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,160
Yoon Jae-in? Why are you there?

859
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,320
Because this is my house.

860
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,120
I didn't hear it because I wanted to hear it.

861
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,760
But even if I did hear it,

862
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,000
I don't really understand what it's about.

863
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,880
Whatever you heard, you heard it wrong.

864
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,000
Hey, wait.

865
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm using all of my knowledge and logic to think,

866
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,520
- but it's not organized yet. - Don't organize it.

867
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,120
Because it was all nonsense.

868
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,200
So you

869
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,040
do psychometry for real?

870
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,040
Hey.

871
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,640
No way.

872
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,320
So that's how you found it out.

873
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,040
Perhaps the culprit didn't enter the teachers' office

874
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,000
for exam questions, but for something else.

875
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,080
What if it was to get back the thing seized by the math teacher?

876
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,240
Like a yellow purse containing cigarettes.

877
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,840
Things about So-hyun.

878
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,400
- 3145? - And that number.

879
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,080
You found out about them all through psychometry.

880
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,160
And you wanted to shake my hands because??

881
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,160
Do I look like a freak?

882
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,840
No need to look at me like that.

883
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,120
It's okay as long as you don't touch me.

884
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,120
So you see everything when you touch the skin?

885
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,480
You said that there are secrets

886
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,480
worthy of keeping, like a life.

887
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,720
You said it for yourself.

888
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,840
I just don't have to see what you're keeping.

889
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,800
And you just need to

890
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,760
- keep my secret, too. - No,

891
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,120
if you really do that psychometry thing,

892
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,840
and found out my dad's prisoner number with that??

893
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,120
What?

894
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,320
Then you're not a freak.

895
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,840
I want you to find out about something by

896
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,400
me running to you and shaking hands, or anything.

897
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,120
Shaking hands, or anything?

898
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,080
You stay right there!

899
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,120
I'll go to you!

900
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,080
(He is Psychometric)

901
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,440
Here.

902
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,560
Is that detective your girlfriend?

903
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,920
Who are you?

904
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,000
A schoolgirl named Yoon Jae-in.

905
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,800
Where is she now?

906
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,200
I don't know why there's a chain here.

907
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,840
It's a challenge.

908
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,080
This is so painful.

909
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,320
Do you think your father is the culprit?

910
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,560
- Your words gave me strength. - Scram!

911
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,600
Make your power

912
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,600
great and awesome!

913
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,120
If you do, when I'm confident,

914
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,600
I will go look for you.
