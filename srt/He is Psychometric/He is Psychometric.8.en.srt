(Dec. 3, 2005, 4:00 PM)

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,040
Wow, wow.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,840
Thank you for your hard work.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,000
Wow, you must be going home now.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
This little brat??

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,840
broke into the police station.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,160
My dad caught lots of bad guys today.

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,040
You can say that louder.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,240
Wow, he's sitting like that, again.

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Who is he?

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,280
Uh, Detective.

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,480
I know it seems like I'm being a bit nosy,

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,560
but may I ask you a favor, please?

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
He moved to unit 701 a month ago.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,800
They moved in the middle of the night, but I never saw his mother,

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,640
and he's sitting in front of the apartment day and night.

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Hi.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm not a weird person. I live in unit 1501.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,920
This is who my dad is.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
So?

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Why are you sitting out in cold? Without a coat?

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
Because this is the spot where I can see

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,800
the people coming in and out of the apartment the best.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
Who are you waiting for?

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,320
Your mom? Your dad?

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,240
I wait for nobody.

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Could you??please move away?

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,040
You're blocking my sight, so I can't see that way.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,800
If you need any help, call me.

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Let's go.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,440
- Dad! - Jae-in!

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,480
Wow.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
- Wow, it's cold, isn't it? - Yes.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,200
Let's go.

38

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, Lee Jung-rok)

(He is Psychometric, Episode 8)

44
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
Prosecutor Kang, what are you saying?

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
I know that most of the gangs like that are connected to authority.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,120
If you do not provide backup for us,

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,680
Detective Eun and I cannot help

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
but suspect you as well, Commissioner.

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
- Prosecutor Kang! - The luggage murder is

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,120
connected to that gang for sure.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,600
Furthermore, we think that the fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,120
is not a separate case, either.

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,480
So I'm saying that you must

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,360
know when to cut it out when it needs to be cut out.

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Prosecutor Kang.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,600
The case we have is enough. Why are you being so reckless?

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,720
If the tail is too long, not only does it get caught,

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,080
but it can also choke you.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,160
I have seen many of those cases.

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,040
(YSS Construction)

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,240
There are two dead bodies that all of Korea is curious about.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,520
You made this big, Prosecutor Kang.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,040
You appeared on TV and put on a show for the people.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,480
Tomorrow will be the day for the press to blabber about

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,920
the police being incompetent and so on.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,160
We should catch at least one of them, shouldn't we?

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,240
About that reporter who saw Kim Gap-yong

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
murdering Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young.

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,960
Is this person trustworthy?

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,320
I guarantee the authenticity of this witness' testimony.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Let me be clear.

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not providing backup because I'm worried

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
about you thinking that I'm connected to that gang.

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,760
Ugh, whatever. Take them all.

75
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,360
Don't hit me!

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,280
Well, I'm moving, so don't push me!

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,120
- Come here. - Damn it.

78
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
Hey, how did you persuade my dad

79
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,480
and make him send all of them so quickly?

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
It is ironic that I needed to persuade him

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
to catch bastards like them.

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,600
Dad is trying to play safe, as he is old now.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,120
He was passionate when he was young.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
Dad??Dad.

85
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,160
Ah??I mixed business and pleasure, again.

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,080
You said your father passed away early, right?

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,280
What kind of person was he?

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's do the practice on me, today.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,640
Uh??no.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,240
Was this the most sensitive part?

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,760
Hey, what are you doing?

92
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,320
This is totally awkward, you know.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're wrong.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,280
That's not the part.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I told you.

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,400
The most sensitive part is

97
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,360
right here.

98
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
Hey! You??

99
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,640
I always skip to the end.

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,880
But this is too??

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,680
I was stepping on the brake, but you told me to go.

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,520
I've been watching only you from the beginning.

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
You know what feelings I had as I waited for you,

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,200
and why I followed you with the excuse of

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,040
- improving my power. - Yes, I know.

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm the one using you with your feelings as an excuse.

107
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,160
Just using me?

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you saying that you don't have feelings for me?

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,880
That's not true.

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
What??did you see?

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Tons of memories about me.

112
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,680
I saw the whole panorama of them, from the first encounter to now.

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,160
No way.

114
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Why??Why? Why? Why? Why? Why??did you see such things?

115
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,840
That can't be. No way.

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I didn't think about you at all.

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,480
- Ah??- You??

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,840
Just how many times are you denying it in one sentence?

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
I was really??

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
I made a big decision, starting this.

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,120
And you??saw that?

122
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh, no.

123
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
You.

124
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,640
You did??think about me, huh?

125
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
What?

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Damn it.

127
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,320
You didn't see anything, did you?

128
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,280
What do you expect after pushing me away that quickly? Huh?

129
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Hey, if I was that skilled, why would I??

130
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,320
Damn it.

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,920
That did hurt for real.

132
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,000
You jerk, how can you tell such a lie?

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
- You need to be whipped. - Hey, hey.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
Don't you know about landing questions?

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,160
It's like throwing bait to get the answers I want.

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
Landing questions.

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
I read about it in the book you told me to read.

138
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
And you need to compliment me for remembering it and using it.

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,000
- But you hit me instead? - You're actually wrong.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's not landing questions. It's leading questions!

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,440
- Come here, you're just so??- Hey, I might fall down.

142
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Well, looks like we roughly caught all of them. Let's go.

143
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,400
"Roughly?"

144
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,200
That's not a word for Eun Ji-soo, the meticulous.

145
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,640
Are you getting better at telling jokes,

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,160
or did you get a new skill of insulting people?

147
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Well, if it was funny, then it's a success,

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,840
and if you thought it was insulting, then it's a new reward.

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,160
Kang Sung-mo, you??

150
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,120
Why?

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Uh, it seems that you've become more positive,

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,000
but I don't know why I'm still anxious.

153
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
You did change for sure.

154
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,440
I wanted to make you change.

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,120
But when I think about it,

156
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,200
I think it was when you met Yoon Jae-in again.

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,080
- Eun Ji-soo. - I'll have one more look.

158
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,240
You go first.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,200
How couldn't you see anything?

160
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,560
I made a big decision, starting this.

161
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Still, I made a big achievement??

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
Let's do it by surprise next time.

163
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't do well if you tell me to "get ready" beforehand.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm much better when I do it with nothing on my mind.

165
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
A surprise to you, that means??

166
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
You want me to do it?

167
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,720
Right.

168
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
You're nuts.

169
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,320
You want me to do it? No way.

170
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,280
That means you can just touch me anytime.

171
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,080
Does it require??being nuts to do it?

172
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
Ah??

173
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,360
Ah, okay.

174
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,200
What were you thinking, again?

175
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
You acted so haughtily, but you're a pervert.

176
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,280
No matter how many times I think about it, I've been dumbed down.

177
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,000
I've been brought down to your level.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,080
Wait for me.

179
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,840
I have to go this way, too.

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Pervert.

181
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
Huh?

182
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,120
- Ji-soo. - What? Why are you here?

183
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Ah??

184
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Ahn didn't do anything wrong. I asked him to come.

186
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,520
How did you know that Dragon Head Hunting and

187
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,040
the luggage murder were connected?

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
Should I say I was lucky, or unlucky?

189
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,080
I found out by coincidence.

190
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,480
Well, they say that luck is also a skill.

191
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,160
If you're not hurt, then that's good enough. Let's go.

192
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
Ji-soo, what's wrong?

193
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,000
Just get mad and hit me. Just like you always do.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,120
I want to,

195
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
but I won't.

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to be respected and admired by Officer Yoon.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,440
By her? Why?

198
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
Is it wrong for a Lieutenant to desire

199
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,480
some admiration from a junior officer?

200
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
You don't need to do that.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,520
She became a cop because she was charmed by you.

202
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,120
Charmed by me?

203
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,920
If so??Officer Yoon, do you like girls?

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,440
Huh?

205
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,520
Ugh, how pathetic??

206
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,560
Nevermind. Let's go eat.

207
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,080
We have seized every single file.

208
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,680
Find files on Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook first.

209
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,080
And report as soon as you find something on fake Kang Hee-sook.

210
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,600
- Yes, sir. Hurry, hurry.

211
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,600
Aside from Kim Gap-yong,

212
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,240
Let's disintegrate this gang one by one as well.

213
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes. By the way, I don't see Detective Eun.

214
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Looks like you don't know because you're distracted,

215
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,120
but it'd be better for you to avoid Detective Eun for now.

216
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
- Why? - Think about it.

217
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,880
What could make Detective Eun grab you by your collar?

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
No way??

219
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Did she hear me talking behind her back?

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Thank you.

221
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,680
Hurry up. I need to get back to the station.

222
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,720
Ah, okay.

223
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,880
Slow down.

224
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Ugh, you told her to hurry up and she's eating without breathing.

225
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Oh, sorry.

226
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,600
Slow down. Slow down.

227
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,920
I know that you're busy, Detective Eun.

228
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
She had to catch a truck full of those bastards. She's going

229
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
to be very busy, writing reports and recording evidence.

230
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
You should eat quickly, too.

231
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,880
It's not because I'm busy, but because

232
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,160
there's someone I need to beat the crap out of, today.

233
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,320
I hate backstabbers the most.

234
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
Is there a worse backstabber than us?

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
So, how much have your lessons progressed?

236
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
It's going well.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,040
With both theory and practice.

238
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
I can't say that there's real progress.

239
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,000
Because he's so unpredictable.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,720
I told you that my power improves simply by

241
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,840
you and me being together, right? Huh?

242
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,960
As our relationship progresses, my power obviously??

243
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Hey, this isn't the surprise touch I wanted!

244
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
Stomp harder.

245
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
Just as you've learned at the police academy.

246
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,760
Hey, were you a kind of a person who flatters the authority?

248
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,440
You're a bad girl, aren't you?

249
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,080
It's so delicious, ma'am.

250
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,280
They don't know about it yet, right?

251
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,920
About their connection.

252
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
By the way, isn't this salty?

253
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
(Seized items)

254
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,680
(Seized items)

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,680
(Fraudulent account, fraudulent passport, fraudulent ID)

256

(Authorized Personnel Only)

257
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,880
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo?

258
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,040
This is the copy of the CCTV footage you asked for.

259
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,000
By the way??Why do you need this every time?

260
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,720
- Mr. Hong. - Here's half a chicken.

261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,760
Come inside and eat it.

262
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,720
Our restaurant allows kids to be here.

263
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Eun-sol is sleeping.

264
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,640
Hey, then you should've called for delivery.

265
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
Why did you bring your kid out in this cold weather?

266
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,160
What profit do you gain for a half-portion delivery?

267
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,680
It might not even pay for gas.

268
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,000
You're in no place to worry about me.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,120
Enough of that. Hey, you should go and date.

270
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,760
You have a kid, that's all. You didn't commit any crime.

271
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,680
Ah, it's cold. Mr. Hong!

272
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Hi.

273
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,880
Will you please stop following me around?

274
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,760
Do I have to say that I hate you, you're bothersome,

275
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
and you're a stalker, to make you understand?

276
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Sorry.

277
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,520
Ugh, what's wrong with her? Wow??

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,600
Hey, here it is.

279
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
It's half-portion, right?

280
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah. Hey, you're rich enough, you jerk.

281
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
So order whole chickens.

282
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,160
Still, I don't call for deliveries.

283
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,960
You're coming to pick it up because I get a free full tank

284
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
when I go deliver it.

285
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,040
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

286
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,600
Rich jerks are worse.

287
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,400
Ugh, that's not true.

288
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,120
If you come next time, I'll give you a full tank.

289
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,160
But, please don't tell So-hyun

290
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
that I'm a regular here.

291
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,120
Hey, it's obvious that she thinks you're following her around.

292
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,520
She called you a stalker.

293
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,080
You need to clear any misunderstandings you have.

294
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
She has a lot of pride.

295
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,560
So, she might be embarrassed if she learns it was

296
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,840
a misunderstanding, so please act like you don't know.

297
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,080
I'll come tomorrow morning.

298
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm off duty tomorrow.

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,240
So meet me somewhere else, besides the library.

300
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,080
- Where? - The place you hate the most.

301
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,160
I hate crowded places the most.

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,440
Movie theaters, theme parks, fireworks, famous restaurants??

303
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Huh?

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Speaking of which, these are all date courses.

305
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,320
Bye.

306
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,440
Be careful on your way.

307

(Recruiting Students)

308
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,240
It fell out. My goodness.

309
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,520
(Recruiting Students)

310
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,920
(Singing, Acoustic Guitar Wire Crafts, and Yoga)

311
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,680
Shall I begin learning acoustic guitar again?

312
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,480
Yikes, that scared me.

313
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
I used to try to be like C'est Si Bon in the past.

314
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,400
I didn't ask you.

315
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400
I heard that singing class might be cancelled for low turnout.

316
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,840
Because elderly Ms. Kim passed away the day before yesterday.

317
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,720
Come on, not having one student won't cancel the class.

318
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
You don't know what's going on.

319
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,760
All the old ladies got shocked and

320
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,360
switched to the yoga class.

321
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
Really??Really?

322
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,680
Old ladies never mean it when they say they need to die.

323
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,840
So, would you like me to sign up for the singing class?

324
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,560
No, thank you.

325
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,040
Ugh, what's wrong with you? Seriously.

326
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,080
Get on. I'm going to the Police Station, too.

327
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
Are you nuts?

328
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,480
Why should I get on the back of someone else's husband?

329
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,520
How ridiculous.

330
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,360
I'm not someone else's husband.

331
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,960
The ink on my divorce document has dried off a long time ago.

332
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,560
What are you mumbling about in the back? How insulting.

333
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
You insulted me, right?

334
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,040
- Let me go first. - Ugh, what's wrong with him?

335
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,200
Thief!

336
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,640
Ugh, seriously. He's so weird.

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,040
What am I putting on right now?

338
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,600
Still, it looks pretty.

339
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,120
I was stepping on the brake, but you told me to go.

340
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
I've been watching only you from the beginning.

341
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
You know what feelings I had as I waited for you,

342
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,920
and why I followed you with the excuse of

343
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
improving my power.

344
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Why is he always so straightforward?

345
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,000
I can't touch him even more after hearing that.

346
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,600
How handsome.

347
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm leaving.

348
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Watch the house, okay?

349
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,040
When a weirdo breaks into the house, like last time,

350
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,120
see his face and remember it.

351
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,320
Don't just bark carelessly for a fight you cannot win.

352
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,520
If you do, I'll pet you and

353
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
capture that bastard's face.

354
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,400
Okay? Huh?

355
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Eat your food.

356
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
Today's class is cancelled.

357
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
Study hard until I call you.

358
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
Hey, that's not right.

359
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
We're going on a field trip today, right?

360
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,080
We'll do the practice after we're done with theories. Remember that.

361
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,320
(1-day Pass for Theme Park)

362
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,400
How keen.

363
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,080
Ugh, this shells my expectations.

364
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
You mean it shames your expectations.

365
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,680
Hey, don't use the phrases you don't know.

366
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,320
Why do you keep showing your ignorance?

367
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,440
You're taking those a lot recently.

368
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,240
It's because of the headache.

369
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,080
I heard that you and Officer Yoon were at the scene yesterday.

370
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Wow, Ji-soo just keeps no secrets from you, huh?

371
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,280
I told Officer Yoon to watch over an unpredictable guy,

372
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,560
but she became unpredictable, too.

373
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,280
Why are you smiling?

374
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,720
You told me to be careful in seeing the puzzle pieces,

375
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,520
but why are you so easy going about Yoon Jae-in's mistakes?

376
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,880
- Did I smile? - Yeah.

377
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
A big, bright smile.

378
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,320
I'll be busy for a while.

379
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
Even if I don't come home, just don't worry about me.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
Don't call me and whine.

381
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,760
Ugh, come home at least.

382
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,280
If you don't come home all of a sudden,

383
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,160
the residents will get the wrong ideas.

384
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,520
Which resident will get what wrong idea?

385
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,600
That we broke up,

386
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,200
or I'm two-timing.

387
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

388
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,200
- Bye. - Sung-mo.

389
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,080
I'm going to read the books in your room.

390
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,240
I really don't know what you're talking about.

391
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Bye.

392
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
I know that you're watching.

393
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,160
I know what you've been doing

394
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
and what you've been planning.

395
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
All of it.

396
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Yes.

397
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,040
I'm sure you do.

398
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,160
This battle was already set as one

399
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,120
that will never end until one of us dies.

400
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,560
If that's the only way

401
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
to stop you,

402
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,240
then I must take that way.

403
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,960
Who should we begin with?

404
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,000
Kang Hee-sook? Park Soo-young?

405
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
I want to start with this woman.

406
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,800
Who is she?

407
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,680
You got the wrong person.

408
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,600
I run a clean business.

409
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,560
Clean business?

410
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,280
You lured those who are standing on a cliff,

411
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,880
sold them as slaves to "clean" mudflats,

412
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,080
sent them on board fishing ships to the "clean" Pacific Ocean,

413
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,240
and you made false vehicle registrations, burner phones,

414
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,080
and fraudulent accounts. That was just the beginning.

415
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,280
Your crowning achievement was making a fake person.

416
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,760
I know that you let this woman live under the names of

417
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young.

418
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,280
Lending her the names was enough.

419
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,720
Why did you have to commit murder?

420
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Those murders have nothing to do with the gang.

421
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,200
Boss Gap-yong did them on his own.

422
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,960
So you admit that he killed them?

423
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,000
Since Boss Gap-yong is dead,

424
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,160
there's no need to hide that.

425
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,320
Yeah.

426
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,080
Well, the murderer is dead. No need to hide it.

427
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,000
But I'm not interested In

428
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,040
the killer or the reason behind the murder.

429
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,320
is this woman, who is alive.

430
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Who is she? Where is she right now?

431
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,840
I don't know.

432
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
After Boss Gap-yong died,

433
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
she disappeared, too.

434
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,520
Disappeared?

435
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,880
Then what about the jerk who killed Kim Gap-yong?

436
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,560
Ugh, do you think we'd stand around if we knew who it was?

437
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,480
When it comes to intelligence, we're up there with the police.

438
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,200
We couldn't find even a trace of him.

439
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,520
How could he kill the Boss, abandon him,

440
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,400
and not have his face recorded by any of the CCTVs everywhere.

441
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,560
He's not an ordinary guy.

442
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120
Is this it?

443
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,800
And we got no photo of the suspect?

444
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Yes, the CCTV at Prosecutor Kang's house and the one on the road

445
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,880
showed the car only.

446
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,040
What about the place where Ahn was stabbed?

447
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,400
There was no CCTV there at all.

448
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,720
What about the black boxes from the other parked cars?

449
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,520
I called to ask for the evidence files,

450
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,280
but Prosecutor Kang already made copies

451
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,680
of all of that.

452
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Detective.

453
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,080
I will testify everything about Boss Gap-yong killing

454
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,280
and abandoning those women.

455
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,440
So let's wrap it up here.

456
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,080
Wrap it up?

457
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
Who do you think you are to tell me to wrap it up?

458
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,160
This is just the beginning, you know.

459
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Good grief.

460
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,960
Ugh, you're frustrating.

461
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,080
If I speak, lots of people here will be in danger.

462
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Don't you think we would at least have one connection like that,

463
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
while running a business like this?

464
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,760
Yeah.

465
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,160
Let's do this.

466
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I, too, want to see how big this case will be, which began with

467
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,480
two pieces of luggage.

468
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,960
Most of the gang members admitted the fact that Kim Gap-yong

469
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,680
killed Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook.

470
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,040
But still, there's no one who knows about the whereabouts

471
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
- of that woman? - No.

472
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
This gang is beyond imagination.

473
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
They're even taking care of YSS Construction's slush funds.

474
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
YSS Construction's slush funds?

475
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,400
They got paid for labor with the names of those

476
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,160
who didn't even work and put it into a fraudulent account.

477
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,800
If it's about YSS Construction, it will get complicated.

478
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,400
This is giving me a headache.

479
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,920
Still, if it's involved in murder more than anything else,

480
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,880
we must cut out what needs to be cut out.

481
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,360
Are you going to cut us out, too?

482
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,160
We've been working together for a long time.

483
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,600
That sounds like a threat.

484
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,960
Not really a threat.

485
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
We will take care of it, so it won't affect you,

486
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,400
Commissioner.

487
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
You gave us the information beforehand

488
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,040
and we discarded all of the dangerous files we have,

489
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,440
so the damage won't be that big.

490
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Well, I'm sure you'll block it well and prevent damage.

491
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,760
This is nothing new for YSS Construction.

492
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,880
We need to wrap it up well.

493
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,560
Your daughter out of all people,

494
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,040
is in charge of this case.

495
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,160
Was her name Detective Eun Ji-soo?

496
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,240
Hey!

497
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,040
Your Achilles' heel never changes, Commissioner.

498
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,400
Then and now.

499
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,400
This makes no sense.

500
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,040
How could they take away the case so quickly like that?

501
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
You know that the corruption of YSS Construction

502
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,320
isn't something we can handle.

503
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,600
But we're the ones who did all the cooking.

504
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,000
And you're saying we should watch someone else eat it?

505
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,520
We’ll be lucky if we get a bite.

506
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm ashamed to be a public official at times like this.

507
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
- Eun Ji-soo. - What?

508
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,120
I think you should step down from this case.

509
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,320
What?

510
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,720
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

511
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,560
The luggage murder case has been wrapped up.

512
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,960
The culprit has been found, too.

513
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,880
What do you mean, wrapped up? It didn't even begin.

514
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,480
If Kim Gap-yong is related to that caretaker who disappeared

515
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,760
at Hanmin Nursing Hospital,

516
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,040
then Kim Gap-yong could be behind the fire

517
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,640
or that woman.

518
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,960
That was my mistake.

519
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,840
I need to re-investigate it.

520
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,440
Yeah, well said.

521
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,680
You were the one who brought Kim Gap-yong as the witness.

522
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,960
And you know something about the person

523
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,440
who killed Kim Gap-yong.

524
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,120
Yes. The one who killed Kim Gap-yong and the one

525
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,320
who stabbed Ahn avoided all CCTVs, like a ghost.

526
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,520
There are more than 300,000 CCTVs around Korea,

527
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,760
but I still haven't found a single photo of him.

528
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,960
What do you think that signifies?

529
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,640
It signifies that he's no ordinary perp.

530
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,160
Because he installs CCTV in front of a prosecutor's house.

531
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
What?

532
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm going to track down the IP address,

533
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,360
but I'm sure it's connected to a burner phone.

534
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,080
What does this bastard want from you?

535
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,800
Don't forget about me saying that you will be in danger

536
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,520
if you insist on digging into it instead of stepping out.

537
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,920
Why would I be in danger?

538
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,800
If he doesn't get what he wants,

539
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
he'll try to destroy

540
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,160
the things that are precious to me.

541
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
What?

542
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,040
(Practice Cases of Administrative Law/Focus on Constitution)

543
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,840
Ugh.

544
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
I just don't get it.

545
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,320
Both Sung-mo's thoughts and these damn books.

546
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,480
Good grief.

547
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,120
There are good books written in Hangul.

548
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
Why does he read the books in other languages?

549
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,280
What language is this?

550
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,320
Alien language?

551
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
Ugh.

552
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,280
This is the only thing I can read.

553
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,400
(Joyous: Feeling joy in one's heart)

554
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,400
(Joyous: Feeling joy in one's heart)

555
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
(Love: A warm feeling of treasuring and caring)

556
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,600
(someone or something)

557
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,760
(Lovely: The looks or the actions are cute enough to love)

558
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,400
(Captivate)

559
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,680
(Various sour flavors)

560
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
(Amazing)

561
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,160
(Suffer)

562
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,240
(Pretty)

563
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,040
(Angry)

564
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,000
Hey, you do that training thing

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,120
and read Kang Sung-mo.

566
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
What's wrong all of a sudden?

567
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,720
Find out what that jerk is thinking right now.

568
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,520
As soon as you find it out, you'll work at the Police Agency.

569
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,000
It means I will officially hire you as a psychometrist.

570
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,120
Okay?

571
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,360
I mean, it's ridiculous.

572
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,080
Why am I his precious??thing?

573
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,480
Since when?

574
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,120
What the heck? That's random.

575
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,120
(Yoon Jae-in)

576
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,800
- Hello? - I chose the place for today.

577
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,480
- Where? - Text your home address to me.

578
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,920
Today's lesson will take place there.

579
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
My house?

580
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Welcome.

581
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,760
I'd like $30 worth of gas, please.

582
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,160
Oh, okay. Let's get out.

583
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,800
Is this your gas station, too?

584
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Uh, yes??

585
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,560
Okay.

586
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Uh??Uh.

587
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,120
May I use the restroom?

588
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,440
Ah, you want to change your baby's diaper in there?

589
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,880
Uh??No, it'll be cold for her. Do it inside.

590
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Let's change your diaper.

591
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm sorry. I'll change it quickly and leave.

592
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,160
She recently caught a cold, too, so??

593
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,920
Hey, you don't need to explain.

594
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,760
I provide this much service to all of my customers.

595
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Thanks.

596
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,400
Sure.

597
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,160
But, could you please turn around?

598
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,000
Why?

599
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,520
She is a little princess, you know.

600
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,280
Ah, sorry.

601
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,840
Let's change your diaper!

602
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,680
I'll pull your pants up. Pull your pants up.

603
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,120
Wow, that must feel good!

604
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,040
I'm done.

605
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,800
Already?

606
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Wow, you're a professional.

607
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,040
I'm a mom. This is one of the basics.

608
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Eun-sol, do you feel great now?

609
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,720
Huh? Do you? Do you? Huh?

610
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,120
Do you feel good?

611
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,960
Huh? Do you?

612
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Bye.

613
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay.

614
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
I'm sorry about yesterday.

615
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,120
I didn't think it through.

616
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
The wallet?

617
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,680
I wasn't mad at you.

618
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,160
I was mad at myself.

619
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,160
At yourself?

620
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,800
When I saw that wallet,

621
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,120
I thought for 0.1 second about keeping it,

622
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,600
and 0.1 more second about getting a reward.

623
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,520
I was so embarrassed by that.

624
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,080
Everyone thinks of such things. No need to be embarrassed.

625
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,600
I promised myself when I gave birth to Eun-sol.

626
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,400
That I will never become a shameful mother.

627
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
Come in. This is my house.

628
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,160
This is my house. My house??

629
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,800
What am I saying?

630
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
How handsome.

631
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Alright.

632
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Welcome.

633
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Please excuse me.

634
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
Put these on.

635
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,200
Ah, this is White Snow.

636
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,160
Ah, would you like some coffee?

637
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,120
So it is you.

638
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,080
The little puppy Dark Lee Ahn picked up when he was lost.

639
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
You're so cute.

640
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,880
By the way, what is that?

641
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Ah.

642
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,160
My aunt packed a lot when she heard I was coming here.

643
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,360
Do I have to figure out which

644
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,800
ones have Pacific sand lance sauce in it again?

645
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
Such beginner-level tests

646
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,080
are done as soon as I saw the sleeping pills at the gang office.

647
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,160
Ah, right. I saved you, Ms. Yoon Jae-soon,

648
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,000
from being sold to an island village, right?

649
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,560
I forgot to boast about that.

650
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,800
Did Prosecutor Kang go to work?

651
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,160
How's the investigation going?

652
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
If he's the kind of a man who tells me about an investigation,

653
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,480
then I wouldn't have been so frustrated.

654
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,240
I'm sure he has his reasons.

655
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,000
Speaking of Sung-mo,

656
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,720
is there a way for me to do psychometry on Sung-mo?

657
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
What?

658
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,080
That bastard broke into our house recently.

659
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,680
That bastard is??

660
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
The one who stabbed me.

661
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,760
I didn't see his face,

662
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,120
but it was him for sure.

663
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,120
Just who is this bastard,

664
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,920
and why did he break into the house?

665
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,360
I don't know.

666
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,880
All I know is

667
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,640
that the terrible connection between

668
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,120
him and Sung-mo must've been there for a long time.

669
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,160
My plan at that time was to never return to Korea.

670
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Did you run away from him?

671
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,520
Then, why did you come back?

672
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,000
I will find this person

673
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,400
and kill him.

674
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,120
He said that he'll kill him? Prosecutor Kang did?

675
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
Yes.

676
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,000
He did say that he'll kill him for sure,

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,160
but why did it sound like

678
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
he was telling me to stop him?

679
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,960
Just how much do I have to

680
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
improve his power of psychometry?

681
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,320
This mission will end

682
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,600
when Ahn is??

683
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,080
able to perform psychometry on me.

684
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
You two.

685
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,480
Are you two dating?

686
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,280
Or playing hot and cold?

687
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,400
What?

688
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,760
Well, it seems that you two can feel and understand each other.

689
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,640
So why??am I stuck in the middle?

690
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,120
Why aren't you two doing it directly?

691
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,080
What? What did Sung-mo say?

692
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,040
That's a secret.

693
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,080
I'm on the side of the one who paid for the lessons.

694
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,720
Come on.

695
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,320
Anyway, I must improve my powers quickly

696
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,120
in order for you to help Sung-mo as well.

697
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,960
So don't tell me to meet you at an enclosed place like this.

698
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,760
Because it makes me want to focus on you instead of my studies.

699
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,640
The brake is completely broken.

700
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,120
Where's Prosecutor Kang's room at? This way?

701
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
No, that way.

702
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,680
Can you read Prosecutor Kang from his things?

703
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,480
That happens seldomly.

704
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,720
Because I can see the door passcode he changes.

705
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,120
That means??

706
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,800
You can do it indirectly,

707
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,760
but you can't do it directly, huh?

708
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,040
Doing it directly isn't entirely impossible.

709
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,640
I did read him properly once.

710
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,720
What did you see?

711
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Hmm??

712
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,280
A woman.

713
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,640
A woman?

714
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,200
It was the back of a woman.

715
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,000
Isn't it Detective Eun?

716
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,520
It isn't Ji-soo.

717
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,680
I'm sorry to say this when I think of Ji-soo,

718
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,000
but Sung-mo doesn't have those kinds of feelings for her.

719
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Does he??like someone else?

720
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,680
Wow, he does.

721
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,480
Because if you like someone, you just can't hide it.

722
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,360
So you can see it.

723
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,120
- Is that so? - Yeah.

724
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,760
Anyway, I can't see anything from the things in this room.

725
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,280
I got worried about him, so I touched his things secretly,

726
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,480
but I can't see anything.

727
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,560
My "brother" isn't an easy person.

728
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,880
That means we have nothing to gain here.

729
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,160
Right.

730
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,640
But since you're here, don't just leave.

731
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,680
Come see my room, if you want.

732
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,200
You can sit on the bed.

733
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,080
If you're nervous about being in a man's room for the first time,

734
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,760
you can hug this and be shy, too.

735
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,440
Who said that this is my first time in a man's room?

736
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,000
It??isn't?

737
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm not the kind of guy who questions it or is bothered by it.

738
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
As you know, I can see people's memories when I want to,

739
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,160
so I am very understanding of a woman's past.

740
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,240
What are you talking about?

741
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,040
We just went into Prosecutor Kang's room.

742
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,560
Ah.

743
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Thank goodness.

744
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,560
It's the polar opposite of Prosecutor Kang's room.

745
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,880
How come you don't have any proper books here?

746
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,600
I do. Here it is.

747
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,600
Oh, did you study?

748
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,760
Oh, you studied hard, huh?

749
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,160
Sung-mo studied from that one.

750
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,880
Ah, is it Prosecutor Kang's?

751
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,000
So he was a hardworking genius.

752
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,080
He seems friendly all of a sudden.

753
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,320
What did you see from this?

754
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,160
Like, Love, Joyous,

755
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,040
Sad, Suffering, and Painful.

756
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,400
Do smart people even highlight those things when studying?

757
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,440
No, I mean psychometry.

758
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,520
This looks like Prosecutor Kang touched it millions of times.

759
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
- Nothing. - Not at all?

760
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,200
You're being disappointed way too blatantly. It embarrasses me.

761
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,120
You need to study every single word and touch everything

762
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,840
like reading a braille book, starting today.

763
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,840
This is killing two birds with one stone.

764
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,400
You won't only be studying, but also practicing psychometry.

765
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,360
And tell me right away if you see anything.

766
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,880
Every single word?

767
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,320
Deputy Director,

768
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,160
I'll send you a cell phone right now.

769
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,800
Please pass it to NDFC.

(Autopsy Report)

771
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,600
The cause of death for Kim Gap-yong, who died two years ago,

772
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,840
is a puncture wound on his right abdomen.

773
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,480
The notable point is the chain on his foot.

774
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,080
No fingerprints. No witnesses.

775
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,920
And the investigator in charge was incompetent.

776
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,040
It's the same.

777
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,000
What?

778
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,960
Yeongseong Apt., Hanmin Nursing Hospital, and Kim Gap-yong.

779
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,520
They all died from puncture wounds on their right abdomen.

780
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,240
And that psycho kid being stabbed, too.

781
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,160
Right. It's the same method.

782
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,600
Ugh, if we had Kim Gap-yong's body,

783
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,920
I could've called Ahn over and tell him to touch it,

784
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,960
but he's been cremated, so we can't do that.

785
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,880
Since when did you rely on that kid

786
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
even more, than you relied on me?

787
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,440
If we had the body, I should find something.

788
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,000
How could you think of him first?

789
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,560
Uh, because Ahn did a good job last time, so??

790
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
(Lovely)

791
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
Ugh.

792
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,000
Ah, it'd be weird if I see something.

793
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
This obviously looks like a super old book.

794
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Ugh.

795
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,440
(To. My Dear Sung-mo, From. Mom??

796
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,040
So his mom gave it to him as a gift.

797
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,520
I sent the data recovered from the burned phone

798
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,960
to your e-mail.

799
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,120
Thank you so much.

800
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,320
What did Prosecutor Kang say?

801
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,360
That bastard will destroy

802
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,000
his precious things?

803
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,840
Hearing it indirectly

804
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,640
actually makes me feel weird too.

805
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,280
Detective Eun, what Prosecutor Kang said

806
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,080
didn't end at the point about you being precious.

807
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,120
The point at the end??

808
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,120
is that, the bastard is trying to destroy you.

809
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,560
I know that.

810
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,000
How can you smile when you know that?

811
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,560
The man who never allowed me in, even a little bit, said that.

812
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,800
Let my heart flutter for two hours.

813
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,720
This isn't the time for your heart to flutter.

814
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,600
He said that it'd be better for you to step down from it.

815
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,960
Dr. Hong.

816
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,200
If someone precious to Kang Sung-mo

817
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,560
is in danger, then it isn't me.

818
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,880
I can now see why Prosecutor Kang wanted Officer Yoon

819
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,040
to look after Ahn.

820
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,120
The one Prosecutor Kang wanted to protect

821
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,800
is her.

823
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,440
What the heck?

824
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Is it broken?

825
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
What are you doing?

826
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,760
Somebody cut off the CCTV in front of the police station.

827
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,560
I will call the call center tomorrow.

828
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,760
What a fearless jerk. This might be

829
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,160
a quiet precinct, but, this is still a police station.

830
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,640
How dare this jerk cut off the one in front of the door?

831
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,120
How did this become like this?

832
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,040
What a work of art.

833
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,200
Oh, my, this is??

834
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,320
- He's clearly experienced. - So good.

835
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,680
What a hand of gold.

836
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,160
Wow, how can he twist it like that?

837
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,640
Wow, he's good. Oh, my.

838
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,920
- What a work of art. - Such details.

839
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, wow, how is that possible?

840
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,520
How amazing.

841
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,120
You can make anything with wire.

842
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,160
Wow, you're actually good enough to be

843
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,040
a teacher, forget being a student.

844
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,120
I know, right? He might be able to make handcuffs, too.

845
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,040
Oh, what a deep cut.

846
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,080
Are you okay? My goodness.

847
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm okay.

848
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,520
No. Hey, Jae-in, go to our room

849
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,000
and bring ointment and a bandaid from the first aid kit.

850
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay.

851
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,160
Okay then, thank you.

852
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Sure.

853
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,440
(Painful)

854
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
Okay.

855
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,240
(Painful)

856
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,520
Sung-mo.

857
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,040
"Painful" is an emotion

858
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,840
we feel when we get injured and bleed from the wound.

859
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,600
I taught you the word "pain" too, right?

860
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,640
I'm fine even when I bleed.

861
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,960
I don't feel pain.

862
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,240
But other people do feel pain.

863
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,000
So you must never make people feel pain.

864
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,120
Then what about killing them?

865
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,360
I heard that pain and emotions disappear when people die.

866
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,600
You must never do that. Never.

867
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,240
That will make you just like him.

868
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,560
If you do, I'm going to be in so much pain.

869
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,800
Even if you don't bleed?

870
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,280
When it comes to pain,

871
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,080
an invisible wound on the heart

872
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,720
is more painful

873
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,040
than a visible one.

874
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,120
That will make you just like him.

875
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
"Him."

876
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,160
Looks like your cut is quite deep.

877
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,800
Doesn't it hurt?

878
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,120
I'm okay.

879
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,160
By the way,

880
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,680
do you live here?

881
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,920
Ah??yes, I'm a cop working at this Police Station.

882
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,440
I know.

883
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,000
I saw you patrolling in the neighborhood.

884
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,480
You look familiar.

885
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,760
When did you move into this neighborhood?

886
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,840
Where do you??

887
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,880
Ah, this is a small neighborhood,

888
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,320
so I know most of the residents.

889
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,680
That prevents accidents, too.

890
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,160
Ah, it doesn't mean that you will cause an accident.

891
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,440
Yoon Jae-in.

892
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,680
See you next time.

893
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,240
Yoon Jae-in. I saw it.

894
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,400
I think I saw Sung-mo from that Korean dictionary.

895
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,600
Shhh, why don't you just announce it to everyone?

896
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,240
Follow me.

897
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,720
So, in a dark room??

898
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,720
Yes.

899
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,000
Prosecutor Kang was??

900
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,280
Yes.

901
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,240
He was studying the Korean dictionary?

902
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,920
Yes.

903
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,080
He was sitting in the dark with his mom

904
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,800
and he was studying about "painful."

905
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Who studies about pain through texts?

906
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,600
That's why I came to see you. Because it's weird.

907
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,480
I'm supposed to take actions, and you're supposed to think.

908
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,600
Ugh, wait.

909
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,480
I'm not a vending machine for answers, you know.

910
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,000
You need to give me some time to think.

911
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,200
And what else?

912
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,520
- Nothing. - Huh?

913
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,640
You ran all the way here after seeing that one thing?

914
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,960
Hey, you told me to tell you if I see anything.

915
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,200
Ugh, you should've seen more when you had the chance.

916
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,560
Ugh.

917
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,080
It'd be great if he can tell me everything.

918
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,080
Ah??It really is difficult.

919
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,600
Perhaps Prosecutor Kang can't show it to you,

920
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,240
even if he wants to show it to you.

921
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,880
- What? - Sometimes

922
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,480
a chick can't hatch from an egg

923
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,080
when it's time for them to hatch.

924
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,800
It is the time for it to hatch for sure,

925
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,120
but it can't break the shell itself.

926
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,000
But, if it misses that time,

927
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,040
the chick dies.

928
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,040
But it also dies if you crack the shell for it too soon.

929
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,600
Why are you talking about a chick now?

930
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,680
Hey, I'm telling you that you're the one that

931
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
can break the shell for him.

932
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,960
Thank you for overestimating my power,

933
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,760
but my "brother" won't think so.

934
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,040
No.

935
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,600
Prosecutor Kang wants you to do it.

936
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,360
Just like how I chose you,

937
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,000
Prosecutor Kang is waiting, trusting you.

938
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,400
Which book taught you to speak so nicely?

939
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,120
- What? - Choose that book next time.

940
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,160
So I can say things to make your heart flutter.

941
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,520
Your hands are frozen.

942
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,000
If you link arms, they'll get warm.

943
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,160
Link arms?

944
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,600
Ugh, what did you think about this time?

945
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,040
I mean, like this.

946
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,360
Nobody asked to link arms with you.

947
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,400
I didn't say anything.

948
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,760
Oh, your shoelace is untied.

949
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,000
Ah, sorry.

950
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,120
I did it without thinking.

951
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,040
I like snow.

952
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,360
No matter how much I touch it, I don't feel anything.

953
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,320
It has no painful past,

954
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,800
and it doesn't make me have complicated thoughts.

955
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,840
And the best thing about it is

956
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,200
that I don't have to get permission to touch it.

957
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,000
I'll help you.

958
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,400
Not now, but when you're ready.

959
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
You bastard!

960
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,040
Wow, hey. What could've happened if it wasn't for me? Huh?

961
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,240
You know that this is the time to thank me, right?

962
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,920
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

963
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,840
What the heck? Are you??really going to be my bodyguard?

964
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,040
But I remember everything about you from two years ago.

965
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,280
Let's do it.

966
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,400
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for me.

967
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,480
It doesn't matter.

968
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,680
I'm doing it for you, too.

969
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,640
Boasting is habitual

970
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,760
and quite contagious.

971
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,960
Ugh, if this gang didn't break up,

972
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,600
then I could've done something.

973
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,400
- Lee Ahn! - Ahn! Lee Ahn!

974
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,040
Ahn! What's wrong with him? Ahn! Ahn!

975
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,600
Lee Ahn! Lee Ahn!

976
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Ahn! Oh, no!

977
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,000
Don't worry.

978
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,320
I won't touch you until you allow me to.

979
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,960
I wanted to tell you.

980
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,160
That your words about helping me

981
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,160
gave me strength, even for a moment.

982
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,920
Make your power great and awesome!

983
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,960
If you do, when I'm confident,

984
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,280
I will go look for you.

985
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,320
I wonder if

986
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,520
this surprise attack worked.

987
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,720
You just showed

988
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,720
everything to me.

989
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,560
Your feelings and thoughts.

990
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,080
My daughter, your shoelace is untied again.

991
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,960
I can't let you trip and fall.

992
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,960
Don't run away anymore.

993
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,080
And don't cry alone anymore, either.

994
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,720
I will look into the past

995
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,080
you've been running away from.

996
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,000
(He is Psychometric)

997
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,280
Kang Sung-mo thought that the Yeongseong Apt. case

998
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,800
has been wrong, from the beginning.

999
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,000
If you're coming here for hasty sympathy

1000
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,680
and out of curiosity, then stop it.

1001
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,200
I'm sorry, I know that I shouldn't mess with you.

1002
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,840
Yeongseong Apartments.

1003
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,160
Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

1004
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,360
And Kim Gap-yong.

1005
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,040
How can it be a coincidence for

1006
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,560
all of the victims to have the same cause of death?

1007
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,960
Don't forget that a scar is a trace of overcoming a wound.

1008
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,560
We can make a music box.

1009
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,040
Then what should I say?

1010
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,520
Today is our first day of dating, right?
