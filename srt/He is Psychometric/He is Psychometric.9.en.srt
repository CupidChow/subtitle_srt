1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,640
(He is Psychometric)

2
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,120
(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
(Nov. 1, 2005, Yeongseong Apartments)

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,760
Buzz, a villain has appeared.

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,960
All members, attack!

6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
Guys, come on! Let's go!

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Come on!

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Let's go!

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Let's go!

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,680
It's someone suspicious.

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
If it's a real gun, let me borrow it, and if not, move out.

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,920
You really are suspicious.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,160
All of the older boys should be at school by now,

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,800
but why are you here?

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,080
Because I don't go to school.

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Why are you wearing a uniform

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,080
if you don't go to school?

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Are you interrogating me?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,120
Huh? Hey, are you running away?

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Detective Kim, get him. He's suspicious.

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Were you on the same team?

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,600
No.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,240
Oh, come on. Search him, Detective Kim.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
My last name is Yoon.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,560
So I'm Detective Yoon. Not Detective Kim.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,040
Ah??I see.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
But it really is suspicious.

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,000
Why aren't you at school?

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
I'm not at school at this hour because

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,120
I don't go to school,

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,240
and I'm wearing a uniform despite the fact because

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,080
my mom would be worried if she knows that I don't go to school.

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Happy now?

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
He's just so suspicious.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
It looks like he hurt his leg,

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
but he walks around like that in the cold, every day.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Do you know him?

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
No.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
Then, do you know me?

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Of course. Detective Yoon, right?

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,840
- Let's play together someday. - Okay.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,160
But let's play next time.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm a bit busy right now.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,400
You promised to play with me next time.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
(PSYCHOMETRY A combination of Greek words)

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,960
(PSYCHE/Soul and METRON/Measuring)

47
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
(An ability to measure the soul of a person or)

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
(an object and interpreting it)

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,280
(He is Psychometric, Episode 9)

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
Oh, your shoelace is untied.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,920
Ah, sorry.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,240
I did it without thinking.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,520
I like snow.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
No matter how much I touch it, I don't feel anything.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
It has no painful past,

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,960
and it doesn't make me have complicated thoughts.

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
And the best thing about it is

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,240
that I don't have to get permission to touch it.

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
I wonder if

60
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,120
this surprise attack worked.

61
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,280
You just showed

62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
everything to me.

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
Your feelings and thoughts.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960
(The daughter of the murderer)

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Dad!

66
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,240
Dad!

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,760
Pretty things are good enough to enjoy for a long time.

68
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,520
Don't run away anymore.

69
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
And don't cry alone anymore, either.

70
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,840
I will look into the past

71
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,320
you've been running away from.

72
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
Did you see everything?

73
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,640
About me?

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
A little bit.

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,000
Although I saw only??a little bit of it,

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
but I could feel your feelings.

77
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,800
I wondered why I ended up with the ability to look into the past.

78
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,360
It'd be better to look into the future.

79
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,200
I can stop dangerous things from happening,

80
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
and avoid unfortunate events.

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,280
Or I can buy a lottery ticket

82
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
and be rich.

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,360
But now I know.

84
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
Why I have to look into the past.

85
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,160
Give all your bad memories

86
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
to me.

87
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,080
I can't bring you back in time

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
so you can start over,

89
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,520
but at least from now on,

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,880
I will give nothing but good memories to you.

91
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
You said your heart would flutter for two hours, and look at you.

92
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,040
Stop drinking. Or eat something, at least.

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
Did I tell you that I was really sick when I was young?

94
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,560
Sick? With what?

95
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,840
I was born with an illness that made my heart beat like crazy.

96
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,480
You mean paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia?

97
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,920
I didn't know you had such an illness.

98
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,080
Because you're so healthy.

99
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,480
Shortly after I was completely cured,

100
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I went to the orphanage where Ahn was at.

101
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,440
Orphanage?

102
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
Ah, you said his parents passed away from

103
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,080
the fire at Yeongseong Apartments, too.

104
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,160
Ahn's father was my dad's junior colleague.

105
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,160
We couldn't afford to take Ahn in, who was alone after the fire,

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,800
but my dad went to the orphanage often. Perhaps he was concerned.

107
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,840
Block her, block her.

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,600
That's exactly where I met Kang Sung-mo.

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
Don't you want to play soccer?

110
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm here to play with you guys.

111
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I don't.

112
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
I don't like it when people touch me.

113
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,840
- What about you? - I don't think soccer is fun.

114
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
Then what do you like to do to have fun?

115
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,440
I never have fun

116
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
with anything.

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,040
Hey.

118
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,640
Your "brother" is so unique.

119
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
I told you, I don't like it when people touch me.

120
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh.

121
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,080
You're even more unique.

122
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Were you at a hospital for a long time?

123
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,120
Uh, and did you have a surgery?

124
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
How did you know?

125
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Did my dad tell you?

126
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,760
See? I saw it again.

127
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Lee Ahn.

128
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,080
Hey, Lee Ahn.

129
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,000
Can you be responsible for him forever?

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,440
If you're coming here for hasty sympathy and out of curiosity,

131
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,080
then stop it.

132
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
And tell your father

133
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,000
to re-investigate the Yeongseong Apartment case

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
instead of coming here.

135
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,280
Kang Sung-mo thought that there was something wrong

136
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,800
with the Yeongseong Apt. case from the beginning.

137
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,880
Is that why he became a prosecutor?

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,080
And did you become a cop

139
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
to re-investigate that case as well?

140
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,200
Ah, I was the opposite.

141
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,280
I wanted to prove that my dad wasn't wrong.

142
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
Looking into that case was the first thing I did when

143
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,400
I became a cop, but there was nothing suspicious. Nothing.

144
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,320
There's no body left and all of the evidence has been discarded,

145
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
so how can you find out the truth with a measly police report?

146
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,920
Documents can always be produced somehow.

147
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,440
Do you think so too, Dr. Hong?

148
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,560
Yeongseong Apt., Hanmin Nursing Hospital, And Kim Gap-yong.

149
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
How can it be a coincidence for all of the victims to have

150
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,640
the same cause of death?

151
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,080
That's why I'm afraid.

152
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
What if my dad is wrong?

153
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,000
What if there's a secret I don't know about?

154
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
You should put the star on top.

155
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,080
There.

156
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,040
Is it done?

157
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Yes.

158
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,760
Ugh, seriously.

159
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,000
Be careful. Be careful.

160
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,080
Hey, call me when you get home.

161
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Sir, please take care of her.

162
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Ugh, seriously.

163
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,360
Okay.

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,200
By the way, you just sounded like a boyfriend.

165
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,280
When I am born again,

166
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,000
I will date you, Dr. Hong!

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
Ugh, seriously.

168
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,480
Sir, please take care of her.

There are no words to express the soul.

186
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,760
These people cannot feel sadness when their pets die,

187
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,480
and cannot feel happiness even if they receive a birthday gift.

188
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,400
Not only happiness or sadness,

189
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,840
but also anger, remorse, regret, expectations,

190

194
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,160
Do smart people even highlight those things when studying?

195
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,120
Who studies about pain through texts?

I'm fine even when I bleed.

197
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,600
- I don't feel pain. - But other people do feel pain.

198
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,840
So you must never make people feel pain.

199
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
Why?

200
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,520
Do you still need something else from me?

201
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,800
There is someone Kim Gap-yong called

202
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
just before he was killed.

203
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Did you check what this number is?

204
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,960
Ah, that number didn't answer, no matter how many times I called.

205
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,280
It was a burner phone at the time, so we couldn't identify it,

206
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,120
but thankfully, that number was

207
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,000
left in your files, in detail.

208
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,120
It is, isn't it?

209
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,840
It's the number you used.

210
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,520
Uh??Prosecutor.

211
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
I did use that number,

212
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,320
and I did answer Boss Gap-yong's call, too.

213
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,960
But I didn't kill those women. I swear.

214
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,520
I'm not asking you about the luggage murder case.

215
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,160
I want to hear about what Kim Gap-yong said to you

216
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,040
before he died.

217
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Ugh!

218
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Damn it.

219
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,200
Who are you?

220
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,880
Go to Pureum Nursing Hospital in Gangwon-do right now.

221
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
Go find a woman, Kim Song-hee and take her somewhere safe.

222
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Shut up and do as I say!

223
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,160
Boss Gap-yong suddenly told me to

224
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,120
take a woman to somewhere safe, somewhere no one knows.

225
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I just answered a call, and that's it.

226
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,920
Where did you take that woman to?

227
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,840
When I got there, she had disappeared already.

228
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,680
I didn't even get to see her face.

229
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,640
Disappeared?

230
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
What's the last fake identity that woman used?

231
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Kim Song-hee.

232
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,240

Hey, you??What is this?

237
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,880
Ugh, seriously.

238
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,320
Are you nuts?

239
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,040
Does it hurt? Do you feel pain?

240
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Do you really feel pain?

241
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
Hey, of course, I do feel pain.

242
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,080
Ah, thank goodness.

243
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,160
Hey, how can you say that when I'm in pain? You jerk.

244
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
Does it hurt? Do you really feel pain?

245
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,520
Ow, my foot.

246
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Ah, I'm sorry.

247
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,200
How can people get the wrong idea about us?

248
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I can't go put up posters saying that we're "brothers."

249
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,880
Hey, tell me.

250
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
Why did you attack me all of a sudden?

251
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,560
I was just checking something.

252
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
I wanted to check??

253
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,160
if you have difficulty in expressing emotions.

254

255
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,680
Come on.

256
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,360
You don't suffer from anything like that, right?

257
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
But why do you study

258
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,560
Painful, Suffering and Like? It's misleading.

Did you??

261
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,880
I saw you studying with your mom.

262
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,800
She was so young and beautiful.

You??

267
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,440
You miss her too, right?

268
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,520
Your mom.

269
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes. For the first time, I envy your power.

270
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,280
Looks like your lessons with Officer Yoon is going well.

271
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,840
You got to see me with this book.

272
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,400
I couldn't even imagine.

273
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,680
You said that I always go beyond the imagination.

274
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
When she teaches me one thing, I learn ten more.

275
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Follow her. You have a lot to learn from her.

276
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,920
And make sure you take her home.

277
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,520
I don't need to take her home.

278
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,000
I always see her in front of the police station.

279
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,040
Don't you know that a boyfriend must protect his girlfriend?

280
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
Ugh, what do you mean, girlfriend?

281
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,120
Hey, Sung-mo, you're embarrassing me. Come on.

282
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Sung-mo, I think I can do it today.

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
How about we sleep together tonight?

284
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,000
Or take a shower together?

285
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,160
Are you nuts?

286
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,080
Ugh, hey, stop it, that's gross.

287
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Just for a little bit.

288
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
- Ugh, it's gross. Hey. - For 10 minutes.

289
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,960
I'll wait, Sung-mo.

290
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
I wanted to check??if you have difficulty in expressing emotions.

291
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
I saw you studying with your mom.

292
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Ugh.

293
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,000
I told you, I won't sleep with you.

294
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,960
I'll put this on your foot. Have a seat.

295
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,880
Wow, you hurt me and bandage me up?

296
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Wow, that must've hurt.

297
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Were you hurt badly??

298
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
This??

299
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
This is still here.

300
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,480
I might have to live with this forever.

301
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
Wounds that have not been treated on time

302
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,440
become scars.

303
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,600
I heard that a scar is a trace of overcoming a wound,

304
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,600
but why does this one look like it still hurts?

305
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
It hurts.

306
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
It still does.

307
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,560
The memories from that moment still remain.

308
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,280
Yoon Jae-in said that

309
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,440
she is a chick who missed her time to hatch from an egg.

310
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,960
So she wants me to help her hatch.

311
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,920
Is it the same for you as well?

312
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,040
Maybe.

313
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,920
I don't know who the man that stabbed me is

314
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,960
or what happened to you,

315
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,080
but don't forget what

316
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
your mom said.

317
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
Then what about killing them?

318
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,760
You must never do that. Never.

319
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,080
If you do, I'm going to be in so much pain.

320
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,960
I will find that bastard, no matter what.

321
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
So promise me that you will wait.

322
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,360
Wow, you were always crying about seeing weird things,

323
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,040
but you've grown up, huh?

324
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,120
You seem trustworthy now.

(Money Monster)

326
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
Hello?

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,040
Hey, what do you need money for this time? Huh?

328
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
What am I? An ATM? Bank of Korea?

329
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,560
You said you'll never call me if I divorce you.

330
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,880
I am sending you the money for tuition and living expenses.

331
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,120
Yeah, I know that I'm your wallet, and your pushover,

332
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,080
but if you called me during mealtime, you can at least

333
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760
ask me if I have eaten before you start talking about money.

334
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,120
You heartless woman.

335
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,320
I don't care about your intentions. Hang up.

336
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,600
Looks like you didn't go home yet.

337
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,360
He's advertising himself as a total loser.

338
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,960
I am dying for a home-cooked meal.

339
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,120
Uh, you see??

340
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,800
Jae-in is supposed to tell me

341
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
if she's going out,

342
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,800
but she left, right when I finished setting the table.

343
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,040
Uh, it's not anything else,

344
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,440
but it's just that I hate having any cold leftovers,

345
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,400
so eat it with me.

346
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,080
What is this unfamiliar and awkward kindness?

347
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,040
If it's pity, then no, thanks.

348
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,080
I totally despise that.

349
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,360
Let's just say that we're in a similar situation.

350
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,160
If you're going to be a loser,

351
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,000
be a loser at home alone, like me.

352
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,760
Why are you eating alone here, like that?

353
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,040
That makes me feel concerned.

354
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,040
What are you doing?

355
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,600
Eat it while it's still warm.

356
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,360
"Eat it while it's still warm."

357
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,680
What a beautiful phrase.

358
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Peek-a-boo!

359
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,600
Hi.

360
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,880
Oh, something smells delicious.

361
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
Uh??Ahn wasn't at the library. Did he leave already?

362
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,000
Is this your officially meeting place? Hm?

363
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,880
Can't you read? "Closed?"

364
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,120
Do you need an English dictionary?

365
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,600
So-hyun didn't leave yet, right? Her car is out there.

366
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
Oh, right. Why isn't she out yet?

367
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
Let's go talk at the police station!

368
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
And reveal the CCTV footage!

369
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,840
Ma'am.

370
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,680
Yoon-joo was jumping on the desk,

371
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,240
and she fell and hit the edge. That's how she got hurt.

372
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,880
Are you saying that my child is lying?

373
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,080
Yoon-joo said that she never went up on the desk,

374
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,800
and that the teacher hit her.

375
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Yoon-joo, did you say that because your mom will scold you

376
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
if you tell her that you got hurt after standing on a desk?

377
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,240
Ugh, are you threatening my child or what?

378
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
So-hyun.

379
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
How's your wrist?

380
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,800
Why are you here, again?

381
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,360
That's not important right now.

382
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,120
Uh, should we??call Jae-in?

383
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,880
Why call Officer Yoon, when you have an expert investigator here?

384
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,040
I got the memory chip from the CCTV in the classroom.

385
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,240
This must be the moment.

386
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,560
Ugh, it happens to be a blind spot.

387
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,440
I knew it. She wouldn't have hit her in a visible area.

388
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,480
Did you figure out the blind spot before you hit my child?

389
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,960
Ha, you're a professional at this.

390
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,680
I knew it when I heard rumors about you being a single mother.

391
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,080
An unwed mother?

392
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,360
I can't imagine the things you must've done to end up like this.

393
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,800
Ma'am!

394
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,920
That has nothing to do with this.

395
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,520
It has something to do with this.

396
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,480
I don't need to see anything else. I figured you out.

397
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm going to have you locked up for assault.

398
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,440
Ma'am, look here, please.

399
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,840
See? Before Ms. Kim ran to the blind spot,

400
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,560
all of the children look surprised as they looked over there.

401
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,000
According to my experiences from my long-time hunch,

402
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
I mean, my hunch from my long-time experience,

403
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
it is certain that Ms. Kim ran towards there

404
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,480
after the incident took place.

405
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,960
Ugh, that's just a speculation

406
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,280
You're speculating too!

407
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,680
How is this a speculation? My child told me so.

408
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,720
Yikes!

409
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,440
I'm not finished.

410
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
So hold still!

411
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,560
The entire scene can't be seen,

412
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
but you can see here the child jumping on the desk,

413
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,680
missing a step, and then falling down.

414
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,720
Now, I gave you something to work with, why don't you infer?

415
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
The child did fall down.

416
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,720
Right. She did.

417
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,000
- Mom. - You brat!

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,040
- Follow me. - I'm sorry.

419
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,520
I will never get on top of a desk again.

420
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,720
Quiet! Follow me!

421
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Follow me!

422
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,880
Ma'am! Ma'am!

423
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,080
Ugh, what?

424
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,400
Ah, you want me to apologize?

425
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,160
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

426
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,520
Mom!

427
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,040
Mom!

428
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,520
You can properly apologize to her later.

429
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
Don't ever hit your child.

430
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,160
I have been beaten up by lots of different people,

431
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,160
but it hurts the most when you're beaten up by your parents.

432
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,760
I know what to do with my kid.

433
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,680
Let's go!

434
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,120
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young, who have been found dead

435
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
inside luggage at the lower half of Han River last month,

436
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,360
were involved with a human trafficking gang five years ago,

437
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,160
and it has been revealed that they were murdered by

438
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Kim Gap-yong, an action-taker of the gang.

439
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,760
Kim Gap-yong, the assailant, had been committing

440
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,160
human trafficking, kidnapping, and manslaughter by targeting

441
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,680
patients without families or the homeless for profit.

442
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,000
However, he was found dead two years ago and

443
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,800
we find that the prosecution has no grounds for an indictment.

444
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,000
The special investigations team at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency

445
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,520
has conducted a sweep of the gang Kim once worked at

446
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,000
and has confirmed that they were running a business

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,280
that sold personal information to third parties.

448
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,480
The team has arrested 25 people, including a gang member

449
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,680
named Kim, and will now focus on finding the solicitors

450
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,160
who benefitted from

451
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
these fraudulent identities.

452
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,440
That's it, right?

453
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,800
The case of the luggage found with a body at our stream.

454
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes, that's the body Ahn and I found.

455
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,160
If the assailant is Kim Gap-yong??

456
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,560
Yes, that Kim Gap-yong, the action-taker of

457
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,120
the gang you, Lieutenant Nam, swept and disbanded

458
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
Hi.

459
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
So that gang was really swept?

460
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,480
They're not the type to leave murder traces.

461
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
How did they find out?

462
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,400
I heard that there was a trustworthy testimony.

463
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,160
A testimony from a witness of the murder scene.

464
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,400
And it was completely trustworthy, huh?

465
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
Who gave that testimony?

466
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm not sure.

467
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,520
There is one who saw it!

468
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,600
I am the one who saw it!

469
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,800
I saw it. I did.

470
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,600
Who else would've been able to find out?

471
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,360
I am Korea's first psychomet??

472
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,960
I can't really tell this. Ugh.

473
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,520
Stop it before I lock you up for shouting in public.

474
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,640
I feel really weird right now.

475
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
Why? Do you think it's unfair?

476
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,560
Is it because you did all the work,

477
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,000
but it looks like Detective Eun is solving everything?

478
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
No.

479
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,520
I'm so happy.

480
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,240
You, me, Ji-soo, and Sung-mo worked together on this case.

481
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,880
Don't you think we'll be able to investigate together soon?

482
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,520
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

483
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,960
By the way, your clothes are weird today.

484
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,200
Your hands aren't in your pockets, either.

485
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,240
Ah, because I look good in hoodies

486
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,120
and I look good in super long sleeves too,

487
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
so I thought about sticking to that style,

488
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,160
but from now on, I'm going to open up little by little.

489
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,640
That's a positive change.

490
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,040
Let's go to the library. I'll pick the books for you.

491
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,920
Ah, you don't need to pick them for me today.

492
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
There's a book I want to read today.

493
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,600
You have a book you want to read?

494
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,520
And make some free time in the afternoon.

495
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Afternoon? Why?

496
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,760
Let's stop thinking

497
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,800
and have some fun together.

498
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,720
(Korean Dictionary)

499
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,920
(Miss)

500
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
Miss.

501
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,080
Having a loving, deep feeling of

502
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,800
wanting to meet or see someone or something.

503
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,440
Yes, Sung-mo.

504
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,920
I am really going to miss you

505
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,480
if I can't see you.

506
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,720
Wanting to see someone so much to the point

507
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,160
you feel pain, sad, and you suffer.

508
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,880
That's what it means to miss someone.

509
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,160
They're all the things I can't feel.

510
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,200
Don't worry. You will get to feel them.

511
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,000
I??

512
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,360
I will never let you become a monster like him.

513
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
You've been avoiding me all morning,

514
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
and this is where you've been?

515
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,840
Wow, you looked great on TV today.

516
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,080
Doing a police briefing with that beauty

517
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,440
is really unfair.

518
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,400
Ha?

519
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,120
Detective Eun.

520
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Please forget about how I acted in the past.

521
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,280
Ah, the Commissioner was so worried about you,

522
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,040
so I only cooperated in sharing information,

523
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,560
but I swear that it will never happen again.

524
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,600
So you'll quit being a spy, huh?

525
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,760
I thought about the possibilities of future development,

526
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,640
but I think a new weapon will be better than

527
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
the old model tank.

528
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,720
Good. To be honest,

529
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,480
I'm trying to cast you, giving you a privilege with your experience.

530
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
Huh? Experience?

531
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,320
Spying experience.

532
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,080
You watch Prosecutor Kang from now on.

533
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
What? Prosecutor Kang?

534
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,040
Yes, report everything Prosecutor Kang's does

535
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,720
to me from now on, okay?

536
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,920
That's not hard to do, but??

537
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,880
Why on someone on the same team?

538
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
It's never stopped you before.

539
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,120
Want to have a taste of the new weapon?

540
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,080
Well if you want to know about Prosecutor Kang, I saw him

541
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,680
going into the interrogation room with a gang member.

542
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,560
With a gang member?

543
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,360
Did Prosecutor Kang question him separately?

544
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,160
- Yes. - What was it about?

545
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,920
I don't know about that??

546
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
Ugh.

547
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,520
Where is he right now?

548
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,080
(How can I help you?)

549
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,280
The location is the playground.

550
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,120
The subject is

551
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
Yoon Jae-in.

552
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,160
The content is??

553
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
(Content: a kiss)

554
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,920
What's wrong with me? What did I just write?

555
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,160
What if Ahn sees this, too?

556
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,560
Is he studying well??

557
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,000
At this rate,

558
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,680
we might end up at criminal team together.

559
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
(100 Ways to Impress on the First Date)

560
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,480
Jae-in, time to eat. Come on out.

561
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,360
Auntie, I have plans. I have to go.

562
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,680
What was that? Huh?

563
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,400
Jae-in, what is it? Huh?

564
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Oh, my.

565
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,080
Did you fall down?

566
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah.

567
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,120
It's not easy to take a shower with my eyes closed.

568
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,120
A shower with your eyes closed? Why?

569
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,000
Because I'm afraid someone might see it.

570
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,720
- Who sees you taking a shower? - Huh?

571
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,520
And, why do you close your eyes

572
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,200
if you're afraid that someone else might see it?

573
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,400
I have a thing.

574
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,760
Ow, my back.

575
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,280
What happened?

576
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
You fell down while taking a shower with your eyes closed?

577
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,640
Because you were afraid that I might see it?

578
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,200
This isn't something to laugh about.

579
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,200
I didn't realize that I need to protect myself

580
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,480
as I improve your power.

581
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Hey, I can't see things like that.

582
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,760
So don't worry,

583
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
and take a shower and get changed with your eyes open.

584
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
Don't try to fool me.

585
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,080
I knew you wouldn't buy that.

586
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,560
By the way, where are we going right now?

587
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,640
I once received a music box

588
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,680
as a gift when I was young.

589
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,360
But I lost it.

590
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,040
Really? What a coincidence.

591
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,080
Do you like my choice for today?

592
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,480
Uh??you can make a music box

593
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
any way you want at this place.

594
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,400
- Want to try? - Sure.

595
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,200
Hey!

596
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,360
Don't try to copy mine. Be creative.

597
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,840
We're too close to each other and I'm concerned.

598
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,880
You're thinking of nothing but touching me.

599
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,680
Let's stay apart from each other.

600
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,280
Ugh, I can't focus.

601
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
Where are you going?

602
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,360
Pervert Jae-in.

603
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,120
By the way, I've been curious about this.

604
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,240
How did Dae-bong get to find out about your power?

605
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Huh?

606
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,720
Well, it was??

607
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,760
a coincidence.

608
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
There's something you're trying to hide.

609
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,160
You're so keen.

610
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,000
There was an accident.

611
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,400
A horrible accident.

612
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,360
What accident?

613
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,120
One can say it was

614
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,000
a minor collision.

615
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,960
It was around the time when I was the infamous,

616
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,880
legendary Lee Ahn of Honghak Middle School.

617
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,240
Let go. Damn it.

618
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,840
Hey.

619
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,080
- Go, go. - Kick him, kick him.

620
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm sorry, I know that I shouldn't mess with you, but??

621
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,120
Beat me up to death.

622
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,880
I risked my life, anyway.

623
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Where are they?

624
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,520
- What? - The bullies that said

625
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,360
they'll let you into their group if you did this.

626
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
You bastard!

627
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Get yourself together.

628
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,600
They mess with you because you act like that.

629
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,480
Uh, by the way, how did you know that they made me do it?

630
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,840
Hey, how did you know?

631
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,080
I happened to see Dae-bong's secret at that moment.

632
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Sorry.

633
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
He touched me twice,

634
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,880
but I just couldn't beat him up.

635
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,040
So Dae-bong had his own pain, too.

636
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,880
I didn't know, because he always seemed bright and happy.

637
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,600
There's more to someone than what meets the eye.

638
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,200
That jerk Dae-bong

639
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,760
never gives up after something catches his attention.

640
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,480
Before he fell for So-hyun, he followed me around everywhere.

641
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,160
I didn't beat him up, so he touched me a lot more.

642
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,320
So-hyun was your savior, then.

643
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,360
So?

644
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,080
How did he find out about your power?

645
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,120
(Honghak Middle School)

646
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,480
Hey.

647
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,240
If you get your money stolen again,

648
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,160
it won't end like this next time, got it?

649
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,040
That stupid little jerk.

650
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Ahn.

651
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,040
Did you eat breakfast? Want to go to the snack bar?

652
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
What the heck?

653
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,680
What is this?

654
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,360
What are you doing? Move out!

655
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,800
Did you beat up Dae-bong's father??

656
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,320
Come on, I didn't go that far.

657
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,920
I just totally smashed the car that Dae-bong's father treasured

658
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,080
more than his life.

659
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,000
That seems pretty far out there already.

660
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,360
I almost went to a juvenile hall for that,

661
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,680
(Seoul Dohyeon Police Station)

662
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,600
I'm about to go broke after paying for all your release tofu.

663
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
What happened?

664
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,080
You said it was going to be really difficult this time.

665
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,400
Thankfully, your friend persuaded his father.

666
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,560
He's not my friend.

667
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,320
I don't have friends.

668
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, Ahn.

669
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,480
Hi!

670
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,480
Hi!

671
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,440
It was so obvious about

672
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,320
how he solved it.

673
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,920
He was smiling at me with a messed up face,

674
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,520
but he did seem like a true friend.

675
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,000
So you told him about your power?

676
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,880
Can you imagine how much more

677
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,440
he started sticking around me after that?

678
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,640
I finally got busted.

679
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,720
Well, you guys shouldn't have any secrets from each other.

680
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,080
You guys shared your first kiss.

681
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,000
Come on, that was a minor collision.

682
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,200
Still, you got a friend thanks to

683
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,480
that power of yours, that you hated so much.

684
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,560
And thanks to that power,

685
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,400
a girlfriend too?

686
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,360
Hey, at least give me a warning before you do that.

687
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,120
Ugh, how can you say such things with a straight face?

688
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,200
Then what should I say?

689
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,320
Today is our first day of dating, right?

690
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,400
You're just so??

691
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,080
Then, what about you?

692
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,400
What is your relationship with So-hyun?

693
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,040
You ran away from me,

694
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,120
but you kept in touch with So-hyun,

695
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
so I'm sure she knows about your secret.

696
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,240
So-hyun??

697
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,880
No, to be exact,

698
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,040
So-hyun's father gave a crucial testimony

699
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,000
about my dad being the culprit.

700
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,000
But I shouldn't blame So-hyun for that.

701
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,560
I see.

702
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Like you said, I want to have fun without thinking today,

703
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,360
so let's stop talking about that.

704
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,240
Yeah, sure.

705
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,080
I told Prosecutor Kang about

706
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,160
everything I know yesterday.

707
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,680
Tell me everything, every detail.

708
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,960
What did you tell Prosecutor Kang?

709
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,920
Where did you take that woman to?

710
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,840
When I got there, she had disappeared already.

711
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,120
I didn't even get to see her face.

712
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
Disappeared?

713
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,120
If so??

714
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,560
What's the last fake identity that woman used?

715
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,040
Kim Song-hee.

716
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,560
The name was Kim Song-hee.

717
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,360
I found the copy of Kim Song-hee's ID

718
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,200
among the materials seized from Dragon Head Hunting.

719
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,160
Like he said, she was hospitalized at Pureum Nursing Hospital

720
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,600
and she disappeared on that day.

721
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,800
Why didn't Prosecutor Kang tell us if he found out

722
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,640
about this crucial information?

723
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,040
You think it's weird too, huh?

724
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,880
Why did he have to keep it a secret from me after he found out

725
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,320
that woman changed her identity from Park Soo-young

726
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,480
to Kang Hee-sook, and then Kim Song-hee?

727
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
Was it because

728
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,720
Prosecutor Kang wanted to solve it on his own

729
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,960
and add it to his performance record??

730
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,920
Just what kind of brain must you have

731
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,120
to come to that conclusion?

(Dr. Hong)

733
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,080
Detective Eun, can you come over here right now?

734
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,560
Right now?

735
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,080
Yes, right now.

This is the CCTV footage of Seoheun-dong saved over a week.

738
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,120
This is a quiet neighborhood, so there aren't that many CCTVs.

739
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,440
By the way, why do you need this?

740
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,200
I'd like a map with the locations of the CCTVs, too, please.

741

Yes, sir.

Pretty.

746

Adjective.

747

The visuals are beautiful, and it's good to see with eyes.

748

The behavior or gestures are lovely or cute.

You smiled.

What on earth are you talking about?

753
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,640
I know that this makes no sense, either.

754
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
But??

755
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,160

This woman in the composite sketch, who lived as

758
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,160
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young.

759
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,480
Don't you think she looks like

760
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,880
Kang Eun-joo, Prosecutor Kang's mother?

761
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,040
I was so bothered after talking to you yesterday,

762
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,160
so I looked into all the autopsy files from Yeongseong Apt. case.

763
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,360
But when I looked at this photo,

764
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,280
I felt like I was hit on the head with a hammer,

765
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,520
just like the dead Kang Hee-sook.

766
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,080
But Prosecutor Kang's mother

767
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,080
passed away during the fire at Yeongseong Apartments.

768
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,400
And her body was found, along with the other women

769
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,520
from the Women's Society.

770
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,800
Kang Eun-joo's face and hands were so badly burnt

771
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,200
they couldn't identify her,

772
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,680
but as her ID was found with her clothes,

773
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,440
they omitted the DNA test.

774
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,840
Prosecutor Kang found out

775
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,640
that the woman who lived as Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young

776
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,800
changed her identity again to Kim Song-hee, right?

777
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,840
But don't you find it really weird

778
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,040
that he didn't tell you?

779
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,000
The CCTV has been cut off, again.

780
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,080
And the street light, too.

781
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,360
What?

782
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,000
Someone keeps breaking the CCTV in front of the station.

783
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,920
This is the third time this month.

784
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,360
You have a human CCTV right here. Don't worry.

785
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,040
How can you compare to CCTV?

786
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,000
Did I overestimate myself again?

787
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,160
No, it's the opposite.

788
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,080
You've been looking deep into other people's pain,

789
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,200
but I've underestimated you until now.

790
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,640
You're flattering me on our first date.

791
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,000
I left the music box I made in the back seat.

792
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,880
I tried my best to make it, but I'm not sure you'll like it.

793
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,160
Is it for me?

794
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,120
Weren't you making one for me as well?

795
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,000
You wouldn't even let me see it when you were making it.

796
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,480
Ah, you're so keen.

797
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,160
You're too good to waste on this small town police station.

798
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,480
I'm sure you'll like mine.

799
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,760
I made it with all of my soul.

800
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,240
But don't be too touched.

801
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,080
Here.

802
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
Thanks.

803
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,720
His hands are quite multi-talented.

804
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,680
- Do you like this one? - Yes!

805
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,320
You're the best, Dad!

806
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,520

That music box??

810
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,480
Did you see it already?

811
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,600
I'm not sure it's similar to the one your father gave you.

812
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,440
I only took a brief look, so??

813
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,720
It looks just like that broken music box.

814
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,120
Thank you so much.

817
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,160
Take him away.

818
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,640
My dad didn't do it!

819
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,040
My dad didn't kill anyone!

820
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,040
Dad!

821
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,560
Dad!

822
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,640
Dad??

823
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,240
My daughter, your shoelace is untied again.

824
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,240
I can't let you trip and fall.

825
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,600
It's okay, I'll be right back. Stay here.

826
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,920
- Dad! - Jae-in!

827
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,920
I'll be out soon, so don't worry! okay?

828
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
You.

829
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,960
Is your father

830
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,080
Yoon Tae-ha?

831
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,040
(He is Psychometric)

832
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,480
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo.

833
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,600
I told her that I'll save her,

834
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,160
but I ended up hurting her the most, with my hands!

835
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,840
Did you have a fight with Ahn?

836
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,720
How am I qualified to help Ahn?

837
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,600
There's no record of Kang Sung-mo's testimony in here.

838
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,840
I'm sure he needs some time,

839
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,160
but he will be back soon.

840
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,200
What the heck?

841
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,440
Why did you do that?

842
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,000
You miss her too, right? Your mom.

843
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,720
I'd like to speak to Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo, please.

844
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,520
Everything will be revealed soon.
