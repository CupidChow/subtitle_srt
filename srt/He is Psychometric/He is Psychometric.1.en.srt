Hey, Mister. I told you about a thousand times.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,640
You should not pass these out without consulting the residents.

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,760
I've been telling the residents not to park in the fire lane,

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,600
but no one has been cooperating.

10

Hey, are you advertising about our apartments

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
having a crappy parking lot?

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,440
I've been checking the firefighting facilities

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,040
and did everything I could.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,680
The firefighting system is a total mess??

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Me??Mess? What? Who said that it's a mess?

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,080
Ma'am, you shouldn't do this to the things that are

17

directly related to the lives of the residents.

Wow, you're nuts.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,960
You're fired as of today!

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
What?

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,200
A puppy, a puppy, a puppy.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
Stop it.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,840
Mom, I want a puppy.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,840
I want a puppy for my birthday.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,320
- I want a puppy. - I said, stop it.

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,280
It's my birthday, so get me one.

- A puppy. - Ta-da! Here's a puppy!

Woof, woof.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Not something like this. I want a puppy that's alive.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,880
One that actually barks.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
Just get one already.

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Come here.

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,000
If I go get a puppy, will you pick up the poo?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,760
- I will. - No.

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Will you feed the puppy?

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
- I will. - No.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
What about the walks and the baths? What about the vet?

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
I will do everything, okay?

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,600
You won't do anything.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,280
Ahn, let's think of something else, okay?

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Dad will do everything for you, except for the puppy.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Then I want a younger brother or sister.

44

Ugh, what is this?

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,680
Oh, no. Oh, no!

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll go catch the elevator.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Ahn, why are you taking that?

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
This? Because we never know when bad guys will show up.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
Not that. I mean the other one.

Ah!

55
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,200
- Are you happy? - Yes. Very much.

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
What should I name the puppy?

57
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,240

That's what I would like to ask.

170
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
Come here, you're so dead.

171
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,880
Wait??Wait.

172
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
This may not be a clue, but I saw a woman.

173
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,560
Yes, right. A woman wearing a ring.

174
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
There was no dead woman wearing a ring.

175
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,480
If she's not a victim, she must be the culprit.

176
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,320
Culprit? No way. Are you trying to fool me, too?

177
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,440
Dr. Hong, this is Kang Sung-mo.

178
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Dr. Hong.

179
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
- What do I do now? - Isn't it obvious?

180
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,000
You said that "great power comes with great responsibilities."

181
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Tell Prosecutor Kang about what you saw.

182
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Be bold and tell him.

183
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
Did you forget about who called me first?

184
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
You did. You told me to try this.

185
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,240
I won't get in trouble all by myself.

186
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,360
(Autopsy Application Guidelines)

187
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Dr. Hong.

188
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,040
- Hide for now. - There's nowhere to.

189
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,400
Go find a place.

190
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
Hi.

191
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
Isn't this culprit a total psychopath?

192
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
He or she should've left them as they are.

193
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,000
Why did he or she have to start a fire? Good grief??

194
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,800
It seems like typical behavior of a criminal

195
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
who's trying to hide and cover the truth.

196
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
I know, right? A total lunatic this one is.

197
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
No, not the culprit. I mean you, Detective Eun.

198
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,040
You're being overly agitated right now.

199
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,000
And strangely enough, you are not making eye contact with me.

200
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,040
Ah, that's because??

201
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,120
Because this case copied the Yeongseong Apartment case from

202
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,640
11 years ago, so it bothers me.

203
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
Wow, I'm so bothered.

204
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm the victim of the Yeongseong Apartment case,

205
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
and you're the one who's bothered?

206
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Yeongseong Apartment?

207
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Don't you know anything about being considerate to others?

208
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,040
I will remember that.

209
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,200
If you're so considerate towards me??

210
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,440
Please stop talking about things that are found in mystery novels,

211
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,560
such as copying, real culprit, or coincidence,

212
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
and show me the real thing.

213
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,360
The real thing?

214
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,760
You two went to the crime scene early,

215
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,960
didn't answer my calls,

216
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,120
and are at an autopsy room,

217
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,960
so this should mean that there's something very important.

218
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,320
Was anything found from the bodies?

219
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,880
Ah??Well??You see??

220
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,760
The victims' underwear were scattered at the scene.

221
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,000
We were having a discussion about it.

222
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,440
Right?

223
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Ah??Yes??Right.

224
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,720
Is there any significance about the underwear?

225
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,040
We wanted to find out.

226
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
What about you, Prosecutor Kang?

227
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Did you find out anything at the crime scene?

228
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Ah, well, not much for me??

229
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,560
You don't have much either,

230
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
then why did you look for me?

231
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,160
I found a witness.

232
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,160
A witness?

233
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
The witness of the murder?

234
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
If so, is the culprit a woman wearing a ring?

235
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
Or is she the witness?

236
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
He's a man.

237
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,040
Ah, he's a man.

238
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,920
If so, the top priority is to go meet the witness.

239
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Right? Let's hurry up, shall we?

240
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Yes.

241
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
What the heck?

242
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
Prosecutor Kang, Prosecutor Kang.

243
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,200
I have something to check.

244
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,760
Prosecutor Kang, Prosecutor Kang. Please, Prosecutor Kang.

245
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
Prosecutor Kang.

246
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,640
Hi, Sung-mo.

247
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
I told you not to come anywhere around here.

248
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
I did see something today.

249
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,160
A ring. A woman wearing a ring was at the scene.

250
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,040
The witness didn't say anything about that.

251
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,600
That's too bad.

252
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,560
Ah, a stabbed body, a mutilated body, and a drowned body.

253
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
Which one is your favorite?

254
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
Huh? Why do you ask?

255
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,600
If you're not the worst,

256
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
then you'll meet them in there.

257
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,200
I wish for you to go and prove your worth.

258
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,440
Sung-mo! Sung-mo! Wait! Sung-mo!

259
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Wait!

260
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,840
No. No.

261
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,320
Please, no, no.

262
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,680
Sung-mo! I'm sorry, Sung-mo!

263
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,320
Stop calling my name!

264
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
Prosecutor Kang!

265
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,040
Did you say you were there at Hanmin Nursing Hospital fire?

266
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,800
Yes, I am an insurance planner.

267
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,360
I was on my way to receive materials from my client

268
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,600
at #702 before going to work.

269
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,440
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
What is it?

271
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,600
There's??There's fire! Fire!

272
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
There's fire!

273
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,000
Ma'am, ma'am, this way!

274
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,520
And a person died, too. A person.

275
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,680
By the way, why are you telling me this

276
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,800
two hours after the incident has occurred?

277
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,840
I thought someone else might've told you already.

278
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,040
You hurt your leg.

279
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,200
I was in a hurry, so??

280
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,720
To be honest, I felt guilty and sorry about escaping alone,

281
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,160
so I couldn't report it sooner.

282
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm so sorry.

283
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,800
The suspect is Song Hee-jeong, age 57.

284
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
She was hospitalized 3 months ago due to chronic depression.

285
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,840
According to the nurse who was in charge of her,

286
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,120
she often threatened to kill everyone.

287
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,920
It has been revealed that Song Hee-jeong was forced to leave

288
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,920
the day before the fire, as she did not pay her hospital bills.

289
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,200
We assume that Song Hee-jeong turned pessimistic as

290
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
she had nowhere to go to, therefore committed

291
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,080
murder, self-harm and arson to commit suicide.

292
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
How's the public opinion?

293
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
The criticism is focused more on

294
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,120
the poor firefighting system rather than arson for murder.

295
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,280
Well, that comes out every time there's a fire case.

296
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,960
Let's do the official briefing first.

297
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Before those reporters blabber any more nonsense.

298
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,680
Sure.

299
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
Since the witness was found quickly,

300
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,360
the police and the prosecution won't be criticized.

301
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
By the way, since the special unit is assembled,

302
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,160
you solved it two hours after the incident occurred.

303
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,040
Isn't this way too speedy, Prosecutor Kang?

304
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,360
Ah, I was lucky.

305
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,840
Do you two know each other?

306
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,800
I have been acquainted with Detective Eun for a while.

307
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,040
Ah, is Detective Eun your daughter, Commissioner?

308
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,880
Yes, well, she still has a lot to learn.

309
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay then, who will do the official briefing?

310
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,840
I will??

311
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
Prosecutor Kang did everything,

312
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,080
so if we do the briefing, that wouldn't look so??

313
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,040
Even if the witness has been found,

314
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,040
I think it's too early to do the official briefing.

315
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,160
How about we do the briefing after

316
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,040
we check and see if the statements are credible?

317
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,960
Is something bothering you?

318
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,080
I have something more to look into.

319
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,280
So, what is that?

320
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,360
You see??I'm not yet ready to tell you that.

321
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,400
Detective Eun, if you're going to ruin this right now,

322
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,680
you should bring something clearer than a witness's statement.

323
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,160
You just say that you have something to look into??

324
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,280
I'm just worried that it will not be wrapped up clearly

325
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,320
only with the witness's statement, like Yeongseong Apartment case.

326
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,960
Why are you bringing up Yeongseong Apartment right now?

327
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,280
Uh??Detective Eun.

328
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
They are so similar. Like they are parallel.

329
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,280
A large number of female victims,

330
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,440
and trying to cover up the murder with arson.

331
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm sure you know better than anyone else,

332
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,080
but the suspect never turned himself or herself in at the time.

333
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,040
So there are words spreading about the real culprit showing up.

334
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,960
Didn't you check the public opinion first, too?

335
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,400
- Uh, Detective Eun. - The real culprit?

336
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,840
You mean that I, your father, was negligent 11 years ago?

337
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
Prosecutor Kang, let's go do the briefing.

338
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,760
That's not what I mean. I mean, the clearer, the better.

339
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,000
The suspect's clothes covered in the victims' blood was found.

340
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,640
What more do you need? You brat.

341
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,160
Around 6 a.m. on October 3, 2016,

342
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,040
the fire at Room 701 at Hanmin Nursing Hospital

343
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,520
was revealed to be a case by a suspect named Song,

344
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,120
who was hospitalized for depression, killed Yoo and Jung,

345
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,840
those who were sharing the same room, harmed herself

346
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,200
and started a fire.

347
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,000
This tragedy, with 68 casualties,

348
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,680
caused even worse damages with its poor firefighting facilities

349
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,520
and aged evacuation facilities,

350
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,280
for those who suffer from dementia or stroke??

351
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,560
40 are injured, and rather than fire??

352
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,840
Ugh, it's so noisy.

353
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,960
Jae-in, over here.

354
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,040
Hurry up, hurry.

355
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,120
Come here. Ugh.

356
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,000
Was anybody following?

357
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,280
Ugh. This is not the first time, you know.

358
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,920
By the way, do we have to do this every time?

359
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,040
Please take off.

360
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Ah, okay.

361
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,840
Auntie, go to this place.

362
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,120
Where?

363
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,400
Wow! You got a place to stay somehow.

364
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,920
Not just a place to stay.

365
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,560
I even got a part-time job and found a school, too.

366
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah, you're an expert already.

367
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,880
Where are my things?

368
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,240
Uh??Ow, ow. Here.

369
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,440
Uh, please stop over there.

370
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,680
Ah, okay.

371
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
Are you leaving?

372
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,400
Hey, you stop right there!

373
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,160
All of Korea is so excited about

374
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,800
the culprit of the arson being revealed,

375
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,880
so I thought you did a great job,

376
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,040
and you saw what?

377
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,040
Underwear sizes?

378
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,840
Hey, still, I entered the autopsy room,

379
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,000
and saw something, didn't I?

380
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,280
Your beginnings will seem humble,

381
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,200
so prosperous will your future be. Get it?

382
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,520
Well??

383
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Uh??

384
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes, a famous man named Genesis said it.

385
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
You know nothing!

386
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,760
Ugh, that pervert.

387
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
Ugh, why do I see only those kinds of things well?

388
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,400
You're psychometric, so what?

389
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
You only see underwear sizes.

390
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,600
Hey, my grandma's right.

391
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,320
"A fly can only see poo."

392
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,120
You don't know anything. You see, this!

393
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,920
This is quite fun as I see and develop little by little.

394
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,920
Seeing everything at once is no fun at all!

395
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
You and your tongue??

396
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,040
So, what did that prosecutor "brother" of yours said?

397
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,160
Isn't it obvious? I just ran away.

398
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,720
Entering there and seeing them secretly is a crime. And!

399
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,360
How can I tell him that I saw the underwear?

400
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,840
Oh my, you're so ridiculous.

401
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
He can't even abandon you, since you're not his biological brother.

402
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
Hey!

403
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,080
What the heck?

404
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Hey, I will see it for sure next time.

405
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,120
Sure, what will you see next time?

406
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
- Shut up, I'll kill you. - No, I'll kill you.

407
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,440
Hello? Hello? Hey!

408
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,640
Is it a lot of fun to peep at women, huh?

409
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,280
- Wait. - Are you upset?

410
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,040
Me? I saw nothing.

411
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,600
You don't know anything. You see, this!

412
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,360
This is quite fun as I see and develop little by little.

413
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,480
Seeing everything at once is no fun at all!

414
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,760
This is clearly a confession, isn't it?

415
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,000
Uh, I think there's a misunderstanding??

416
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,440
Entering there and seeing them secrely is a crime. And!

417
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,240
How can I tell him that I saw the underwear?

418
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,960
Hey! I will see it for sure from now on.

419
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,400
Wow, this is driving me nuts!

420
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,800
Ah! You! You're??

421
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,480
I am not the one who peeped at you in the restroom.

422
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I never said that it was in the restroom.

423
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
Huh?

424
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,480
You crazy pervert!

425
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,360
You pervert! Don't touch me!

426
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,160
Uh, this is, you see??

427
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,680
I didn't do it! I didn't! I'm serious!

428
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,000
(Police Station)

429
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,560
Mister! Sir! Big bro! No, the nose-blowing man!

430
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Quiet!

431
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,600
I really didn't do it! This is driving me nuts!

432
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,920
This really is driving me nuts.

433
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Are we done?

434
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,040
Well, the evidence is clear,

435
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,440
and the accusation form is perfect enough to be used as a sample.

436
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,880
You're so smart.

437
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,440
I never thought I could use my essay-writing skills here.

438
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,080
Ah, you're a senior in high school?

439
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,440
Yes, there may be an illegal camera in the restroom,

440
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,280
so please search the crime scene thorougly.

441
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Please send me the progress via text.

442
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,280
I can't answer calls during class. Well then, farewell.

443
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Wait! Hey! Where are you going!

444
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,040
Hey! Where are you going! Hey! Stop right there!

445
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Wait till I catch you! I mean it!

446
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,400
I memorized your face!

447
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,040
I will destroy you if I catch you!

448
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
That hurts.

449
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,280
Sir, sir.

450
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,720
How can you lock up a good high school student

451
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,280
just by listening to one person's claims! Huh?

452
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,160
Hey! Hey!

453
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,440
Hey! You're Lee Ahn, aren't you?

454
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,120
Uh, I, I'm not.

455
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,160
Do you know him?

456
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,160
All cops knew who he was in the neighborhood down there.

457
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,720
The legendary Lee Ahn of Honghak Middle School.

458
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,520
I thought he either

459
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,080
went to a juvenile hall or died.

460
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,000
But he became a good and perverted high schooler.

461
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,920
What a twist.

462
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,640
Ah, is he famous?

463
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,040
Then what should we do? This is getting worse.

464
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I hate it when things get worse.

465
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,920
Call Detective Eun Ji-soo at the central station.

466
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,040
Detective Eun Ji-soo?

467
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,160
No! Never! Put me in prison instead!

468
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,600
Please, just this once.

469
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Wow, that hit me.

470
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,720
That hit me.

471
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Hey, where's my gun? Huh?

472
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,000
Ugh, this is embarrassing.

473
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,560
Wow, it brings back memories.

474
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Hey!

475
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,240
No, Ji-soo, that's not what it is??

476
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,120
You got into women's restroom?

477
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,880
I didn't do it!

478
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,360
Do you think I'm a perverted loser

479
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,240
who peeps into the women's restroom?

480
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
Yes, I totally do. You're a perverted loser.

481
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,040
85C, 80B, 75A!

482
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,320
Those numbers are eternally unforgettable, right?

483
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,640
Those are just numbers.

484
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,520
You didn't tell Sung-mo, did you?

485
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,040
Why would I?

486
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,080
Forget all of those memories about what happened here, too!

487
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,440
Forget it! Come on!

488
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,040
Ugh! It's no use to just erase it from my memory!

489
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,680
What are you going to do with

490
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
what's written on the accusation form, in 5W1H?

491
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,800
I, too,

492
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,560
can say that I am not guilty, in 5W1H as well.

493
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,160
Wait.

494
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Do you even know what 5W1H is?

495
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,440
Uh, wha??

496
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
I'm offended, so I won't say.

497
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
Don't think that I'm not saying it because I don't know.

498
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,120
And I brought that jerk to the autopsy room.

499
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,240
What law?

500
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Violation of Act on Special Cases
Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes.

501
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,120
Which means you will go to prison and have criminal record

502
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,960
for invading into public areas for sexual purposes.

503
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,560
Wow, you and your "brother" will see each other in court.

504
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,360
As a prosecutor and a suspect.

505
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,080
Criminal record?

506
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,320
You're already a shame, and if you become a sex offender??

507
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,360
No. This is better. If you have a conscience,

508
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,760
you won't say that you will become the 1st psychometrist of Korea

509
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,080
or do investigation counseling once you get a criminal record.

510
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,360
Come on!

511
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,120
It was you who told me to become a psychometrist!

512
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,800
Hey! I said that so you can have a dream

513
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,280
and do something

514
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,040
because you're causing too much trouble.

515
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
I didn't expect you to take it that quickly.

516
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,040
I'm trying to make my dream come true,

517
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,840
so why aren't you cooperating?

518
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,160
How can I cooperate more from this point on?

519
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,400
I even took you to an autopsy room unbeknownst to Prosecutor Kang.

520
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,160
You should've told me that this is a copycat crime of Yeongseong.

521
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,920
If I knew what kind of case this was,

522
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,000
I would've become totally serious about this case.

523
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Reciting underwear sizes seriously would've been worse.

524
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,080
Oh, come on.

525
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,560
Hey, anyway, don't make this one worse,

526
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,360
and consult Prosecutor Kang.

527
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,520
Before you go to prison as a pervert for real.

528
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,160
I will solve it on my own. Why do I need to bring Sung-mo in??

529
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,600
How can you solve it on your own?

530
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
Why can't I solve it on my own?

531
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,200
When I have this!

532
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,200
Wow, okay, okay.

533
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,600
You and your tongue??

534
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,840
Is this the guy?

535
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,080
Yes, there's CCTV footage of him jumping over the wall the day

536
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,160
before the exams, and his grades suddenly rocketed to rank 15.

537
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,760
So I'm sure that he broke into the teachers' office

538
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,360
the day before the midterm exams.

539
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,040
I told you that as the key to the teachers' office

540
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,360
was broken before the exams,

541
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,800
it means that someone must've broken in.

542
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Wasn't it you, Ms. Jung, who told us to cover it up,

543
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
because it's nothing?

544
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
- Me? - Yes.

545
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,920
Five group fights,

546
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,560
(Student Record)

547
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,280
and he's been late, left early, and been absent for??70 days?

548
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He's about to be expelled even if we let him be, this bastard??

549
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,080
I mean, brat.

550
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
He's a troublemaker at school.

551
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,240
He's practically a cancer.

552
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,320
Just cut him out quietly.

553
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,520
What's that sound?

554
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,560
He's here.

555
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
That brat.

556
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Are you eating that all by yourself?

557
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Want some?

558
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,720
Why? By the way, weren't you coming to school earlier?

559
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,440
Why are you so late?

560
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I had some issues.

561
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,400
By the way, this is a real disaster.

562
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,120
If it? not worse than going to prison as a pervert,

563
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,200
then just keep your mouth shut.

564
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,440
What is this about?

565
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,880
Of course it's worse than that.

566
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
What is it?

567
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,320
My dear So-hyun finally broke up with her boyfriend.

568
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,080
Finally, she saw how great I, Lee Dae-bong, am.

569
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,160
Oh my, what if she asks me out today?

570
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm not ready at all.

571
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,040
Did she say that she likes you?

572
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,280
I was going home the day before yesterday,

573
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,160
and she glanced at me while she was walking.

574
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,600
She did that to a statue of General Yi Sun-sin, too.

575
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,160
Hey, do some psychometry on So-hyun too.

576
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,560
Though I'm sure that her head is filled with thoughts about me.

577
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,080
No way! General Yi Sun-sin is way more attractive.

578
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,360
Ah, right. The math teacher is looking for you.

579
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,000
You have to run! Run faster!

580
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,920
Transferring at the end of the senior year. How new.

581
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,520
Pleased to meet you.

582
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,120
No, I'm pleased to meet you!

583
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,520
You're a top level student aiming for SNU.

584
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,720
I don't have to do anything to do what I want to do!

585
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Your dream jobs are lawyer, prosecutor, and judge?

586
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,000
Is your family working in the legal field?

587
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Well??

588
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,960
But how many times have you transferred to new schools?

589
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,800
You don't have any record of being punished.

590
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,000
I just want to study quietly.

591
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,600
Darling, this school is for those kids

592
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,880
who hate studying. They're all crazy??

593
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,560
What about that jerk?

594
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,120
Yikes, that scared me. He'll be here soon.

595
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,080
But do we really have to do this?

596
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,200
He will be expelled soon, even if isn't for this.

597
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,880
You're saying weird things in front of a student.

598
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,960
But darling, where's your family background record?

599
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Here.

600
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,280
Do schools still require such a thing these days?

601
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,400
- Huh? - Parents' jobs and housing??

602
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,440
And even incomes?

603
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,000
Family background records make students feel inferior

604
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,120
and serve as the starting point of prejudice.

605
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,720
Ah, it doesn't matter for me,

606
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,240
but it would be trouble for you

607
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,920
if such a story is spread online and you're criticized for it.

608
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,560
Right? I suggested quite a few times

609
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,960
to not to do such thing,

610
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,760
but the superiors never listen to us.

611
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,720
Want to go to the classroom when the bell rings? Wait for a bit.

612
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,080
Want to sit here and wait?

613
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,920
I'll go to the restroom before class.

614
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,040
Okay, go ahead!

615
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,080
Wow, you're such a darling!

616
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,960
Wow!

617
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,960
You don't know anything. You see, this!

618
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,560
This is quite fun as I see and develop little by little.

619
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,040
Entering there and seeing them secrely is a crime. And!

620
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,200
How can I tell him that I saw the underwear?

621
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,160
(Main Office)

622
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,840
Who was the math teacher?

623
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,200
Was it the one with a bad breath?

624
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,440
Was it a woman?

625
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,120
He's a man! With one-sided hair!

626
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,480
Ah, one-sided hair.

627
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,880
What the heck? Why are you here?

628
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,080
You got released early.

629
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,520
Was it your first crime? That's so unlikely.

630
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,160
You go and cancel the lawsuit, now.

631
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,480
If not, I will sue you back

632
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,840
for defamation.

633
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,480
Where was the footage from earlier?

634
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,600
Where's the broadcasting room?

635
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,840
Ah, is this the teachers' office?

636
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,480
Yes! I know that it called for your misunderstandings.

637
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,000
But what I saw is

638
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,280
not something you think it is.

639
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,560
Uh, I can't really explain it, but??

640
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,360
You, follow me.

641
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,280
Sir! Sir! Sir!

642
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
You little brat.

643
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,040
You caused trouble, and you have guts to come in late, huh?

644
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,040
Ugh, I really didn't do it.

645
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,960
I don't know what she said

646
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
by coming all the way to our school,

647
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,080
but I really am innocent.

648
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,080
Innocent? Hey, how can you be, with such clear evidence?

649
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,000
What is this?

650
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,040
Grade rank 15 in the entire school??Wow, what a genius.

651
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,880
Who is it?

652
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,600
Oh, Lee Ahn.

653
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,840
Huh? This is mine?

654
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,800
Right? This makes no sense even to you, right?

655
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
Ah!

656
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,800
So you copied the answers from the guy in front of you?

657
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,760
In every single subject?

658
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,280
Uh, it was for practice? No, not really,

659
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,160
but he was totally defenseless.

660
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,000
Either he has a clear brain or I was in good condition.

661
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,160
What did you do at dawn on September 25th?

662
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,000
September 25th?

663
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,880
The day before the midterm exams!

664
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,000
5:30 a.m. on Sunday, to be exact.

665
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,680
If it was Sunday at dawn, I was sleeping, of course.

666
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,360
You bastard!

667
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,760
We have the CCTV footage of you jumping over the wall.

668
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,120
Ah, ah! That day!

669
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,320
You broke the lock on the teachers' office

670
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,600
and stole exam questions from the teachers' computers, huh?

671
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,080
What? I just set my alarm early and came here early

672
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,080
because I didn't want to get on a crowded bus.

673
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,000
But when I came, the other kids weren't here,

674
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,960
there was no class, and it was Sunday.

675
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,840
So I got so flustered and went back home, so??

676
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,960
Ah, so you forgot that it was Sunday and came to school?

677
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,360
My homeroom teacher told me a million times that

678
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,200
I cannot be absent or late anymore until graduation??

679
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,040
My homeroom teacher's so hysterical these days.

680
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,480
So, you came to school by instinct

681
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,960
on Sunday, at 5:30?

682
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,000
I told you, I hate crowded buses.

683
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,400
By the way, is today the Framing Day or something?

684
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,320
Or is this a hidden camera?

685
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Hey! You bastard, are you playing with me?

686
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,160
Bastards like you give the entire school a bad name!

687
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,840
All those hardworking teachers and students

688
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,000
are thought to be at a bad school

689
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,880
because of bastards like you!

690
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,160
You little!

691
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,120
You go bring your parents right now.

692
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,080
I will make it look like you left school voluntarily,

693
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,160
because I pity your remaining future life.

694
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,240
My parents passed away.

695
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,680
But that's not what's important right now.

696
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,000
Either expulsion or withdrawal,

697
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,400
if I'm kicked out of this school,

698
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,280
I have no other school to go to. That's the point.

699
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,000
I knew you were rude as hell, and you were an orphan?

700
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
That's not what's important.

701
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,960
My "brother"

702
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,320
ordered me to

703
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,040
graduate from high school at least,

704
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,560
even if I can do anything else.

705
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,800
Shut up and scram.

706
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,120
Let's just expel him.

707
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Okay.

708
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,720
Graduation is coming up soon, so suspend me instead,

709
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,000
and leave expulsion out!

710
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,800
I will even do 500 hours of school service.

711
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,200
I said, scram!

712
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,280
Sir!

713
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,160
You little brat!

714
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,040
Are you about to punch me? Huh?

715
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,200
Hey! Don't look at me like that! Will you punch me?

716
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Wait, sir, sir, you can't do this. You can't.

717
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,480
- Let go. - Ugh, you can't do this!

718
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,200
You can't do this now! Not now!

719
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,000
There's only one minute to go for the assembly!

720
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,840
So what? Do you have business with him too, Mr. Hong?

721
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,920
No.

722
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm just here to borrow a cigarette??

723
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,320
I don't smoke.

724
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,360
Uh, don't you have those

725
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,640
you seized from the kids?

726
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,240
Ugh, take them, then.

727
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,560
What? What do you want? Domestic or imported?

728
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,040
- Domestic. - This one's domestic!

729
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,960
Alright, the assembly is starting late.

730
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,400
To your seats!

731
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
We have a new student in our class.

732
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,840
Yeah, no one's interested, huh?

733
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,840
Go sit in any of the empty seats.

734
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,160
Hey, Bong! Where's Lee Ahn?

735
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,880
Huh? He didn't return from the teachers' office.

736
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay!

737
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,720
Get ready for class,

738
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,280
or not. Ugh!

739
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,440
(My Big Bro Sung-mo)

740
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Ugh.

741
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,080
If I'm a human being,

742
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,040
I should repay him for saving me,

743
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,960
instead of causing trouble.

744
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,000
I'm not helpful in any way.

745
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
I didn't survive all by myself

746
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,280
to live a life like this.

747
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,200
The next class is P.E. Put this on, new girl.

748
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Kim So-hyun?

749
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,120
Do you remember me?

750
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,400
It's you, isn't it?

751
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,360
It was suspicious you transferred at the end of senior year.

752
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,000
So it is you.

753
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,040
What's suspicious?

754
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,520
You!

755
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,160
District Head Yoon Kyung-hoon, who's running for the election.

756
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,560
He's your dad, right?

757
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,720
I heard he moved from Gangnam because of the district issue.

758
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
It's you, isn't it?

759
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,160
I understand that you want to unveil my identity on the 1st day,

760
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,520
but let's slow that down.

761
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
Slow it down.

762
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,040
I hate the fact that she is so shameless.

763
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
Next.

764
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,880
(Mr. Yoon, the angelic security guard of Yeongseong. Who is he?)

765
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,600
Little child, don't worry.

766
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,160
I was a firefighter.

767
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,200
I will rescue your parents and everyone in this

768
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,640
apartment and get out, okay?

769
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,120
Can you trust me?

770
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,080
Mom!

771
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,120
Careful, careful.

772
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,160
Thank you.

773
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,160
Mom! Dad!

774
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,640
Wait here for a moment.

775
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,040
I'll go rescue your mom and dad.

776
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,600
(Yoon Tae-ha the hero of the fire case)

777
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,240
(has been revealed to be fake??

778
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,760
Next.

779
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,400
Number 3145.

780
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,520
The review for your parole will now begin.

781
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,600
(Prosecution Service)

782
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,120
(Murder and Fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital)

783
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,760
By the way, about Ahn.

784
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,680
What does he actually see?

785
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,080
Well, Ahn said that it's a powerful memory

786
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,040
that a person or an object possesses,

787
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,080
but I just can't figure out what it is??

788
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,240
You know it correctly.

789
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,880
The correct answer is that it's a mysterious power.

790
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,760
To be honest??

791
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,680
I am bothered about what Ahn saw at

792
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,320
the autopsy room earlier.

793
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,640
I'm sure what's bothering you isn't the underwear size.

794
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,160
Is it about the woman wearing a ring?

795
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,120
So Dr. Hong told you everything, huh?

796
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,120
Ahn performed psychometry on the dead bodies for the first time,

797
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,240
so I'm trying to organize my thoughts too, but??

798
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,120
Perhaps he reads the memories of the dead bodies

799
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,040
like how he does with objects, rather than people.

800
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,240
What's the difference?

801
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
When performing psychometry on people,

802
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,720
the psychometrist reads painful memories or

803
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,000
big or small shocking incidents.

804
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,800
Ah, right. The trauma.

805
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
Yes.

806
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,200
But it's different with objects.

807
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,520
It's more objective, sporadic,

808
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,000
and emotionless, I guess.

809
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,880
So, it's inconsistent, you mean.

810
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,160
I'm sure that the woman wearing a ring was one of

811
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,000
those who went in and out of that patient's room.

812
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,280
Don't worry too much about it.

813
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,360
Ah, a caregiver.

814
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,560
Yes, Ahn saw the underwear of the victims

815
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,320
from the memory before their deaths.

816
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,560
But all of the dead victims have no family.

817
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,760
Plus they can't move freely.

818
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,560
What if the caregiver brought underwear for them?

819
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,880
Just before the victims died.

820
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,040
I guess so.

821
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,520
Come on!

822
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,160
Are you saying it's meaningless, because this case is closed?

823
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,720
Detective Eun, are you obsessed with Ahn's power?

824
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,080
Or are you obsessed with this case?

825
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,360
Both.

826
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,560
And as for you, Prosecutor Kang, why aren't you taking

827
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,000
Ahn and this case seriously?

828
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,920
I am taking everything seriously.

829
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,240
You know that Ahn's power began since Yeongseong case, right?

830
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,640
So you organized all of these? From then until now?

831
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,080
I told you, I'm taking everything seriously.

832
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,640
Looks like you, Detective Eun,

833
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,920
isn't taking Ahn seriously,

834
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,760
while you're trying to make him into a psychometrist quickly.

835
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,640
Hey, you should've told me.

836
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,480
Then, what about this case?

837
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,640
Why are you trying to cover it up so quickly?

838
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,960
I didn't cover it up. I solved it.

839
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,280
You were so careful about everything,

840
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,320
and you solved this one so easily, with a single witness?

841
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,800
It's just a fire case,

842
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,920
but I'm bothered that they keep mentioning Yeongseong Apt.

843
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah, many people still suffer upon hearing that name.

844
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,640
Suffering.

845
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,160
Yes.

846
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,720
Such emotions.

847
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,240
Fire!

848
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,120
No matter how far I run away, I'm always coming back here.

849
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,840
Prosecutor Kang!

850
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,400
If so, how long are you going to

851
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,200
just stand there and watch Ahn?

852
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,440
Until Ahn

853
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,120
finds someone whom he really wishes to

854
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,680
perform psychometry on.

855
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,800
I, too, have someone I wish Ahn could

856
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,360
perform psychometry on.

857
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,600
Who is that someone?

858
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,920
I'm sure he already met that someone by now.

859
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,200
(He is Psychometric)

860
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,240
Stop!

861
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,840
Did you transfer to this school because I go to this one?

862
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,520
How successful!

863
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,000
- Found you! - You said you missed me.

864
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,680
About you being happy.

865
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,960
It's quite similar that you choose the answer that is wanted.

866
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,840
Hey! What are you doing, huh!

867
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,920
What the heck? Does he live here?

868
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,960
- A woman? - Pervert!

869
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,120
Why are you nosebleeding?

870
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,160
Do I look like a monster?

871
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,120
Touching the girl who thinks of you as a pervert?

872
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,000
Yes!

873
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,480
Did you know?

874
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,040
The woman who carries cigarettes in a yellow purse!

875
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,560
Yes, that was me!
