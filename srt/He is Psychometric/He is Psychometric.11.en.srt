(He is Psychometric)

2
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,000
(He is Psychometric)

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
What is this place?

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
Yes, that person.

5
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,800
I was about to go back after waiting for you.

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,280
What? Me?

7
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,320
Ah??Please wait.

8
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,160
Why would he wait for me?

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I know, right? He might be able to make handcuffs, too.

10
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
Do you live here?

11
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,920
Ah??yes, I'm a cop working at this Police Station.

12
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sure he looked familiar.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,920
Where did I see him?

14
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,480
Just where?

15
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,120
Dad, I'm sleepy.

16
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Get some more sleep.

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You.

18
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
(PSYCHOMETRY A combination of Greek words)

19
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
(PSYCHE/Soul and METRON/Measuring)

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
(He is Psychometric, Episode 11)

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
Jae-in, where are you?

24
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,520
The caller cannot be reached. Please leave a message??

25
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
Long time no see, Kang Sung-mo.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,640
I wanted to hear your voice,

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,800
but looks like I'm a bit late.

28
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Did you find Eun-joo?

29
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
What are you going to do now?

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,360
Are you going to hide her in a place where I can't find her?

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,040
Just in case you're thinking of doing that,

32
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,320
I brought someone, too.

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,080
I thought that, if you take my girl away,

34
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,440
it's only fair if

35
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,000
I take your girl away as well.

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Ah??I guess it may be unfair.

37
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,600
Because you can't kill my girl,

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
but I can??

39
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
kill your girl.

40
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,920
Well? Did that answer your question?

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,120
This is the reason why I brought you here.

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,800
I remember your face.

43
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
You took my dad's clothes.

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,520
It's you, isn't it?

45
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
The one who stabbed Ahn,

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,160
and the one who's been stalking Prosecutor Kang for a long time.

47
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,560
You were the culprit.

48
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,160
(You have one new voicemail)

49
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,040
Is that important at this moment?

50
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
I think what's important right now

51
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,080
is what I might do with you.

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,840
I can't see anything. Damn it.

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,440
Just why are you doing this?

54
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,360
Have you heard of the story of the Little Prince?

55
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,120
The Little Prince, who grew his own rose

56
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
on a small planet.

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
What are you trying to say?

58
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,120
How about we make some changes to that story?

59
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Into a story of that preciously tamed flower

60
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,360
being picked by someone else.

61
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,200
Could it have been a beautiful tale?

62
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,320
How would you feel about it?

63
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,000
The feeling of losing the most precious thing.

64
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Damn it.

65
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,040
What about Kang Sung-mo?

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Ah, but looks like Kang Sung-mo now has

67
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,080
more than one precious thing.

68
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
He has a "brother" named Lee Ahn,

69
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,040
Detective Eun Ji-soo,

70
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,160
and you.

71
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,040
Kang Sung-mo has so many things to protect now.

72
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,280
For me, she is still the only one.

73
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
"She?"

74
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
It seems that you still don't know anything.

75
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
If you know who she is,

76
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,480
it would've been easier to understand my behavior.

77
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,440
Things will never turn out the way you want them to.

78
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,240
Look into every single potential clue, okay?

79
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,280
Yes, sir.

80
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes, Detective Eun.

81
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,880
Detective Lee, listen to me carefully.

82
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,400
Use all of the backup you can to find Officer Yoon.

83
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,120
I'll take responsibility for everything.

84
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
And remember the guy who found the luggage at the stream?

86
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
You mean this guy you consider as your little brother?

87
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,120
Yeah, if he tells you to search a certain area,

88
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
- then do as he says. - Huh?

89
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,440
If Officer Yoon has been kidnapped,

90
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,040
he is our best chance of finding her.

91
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,640
- Hello? Detective Eun? - So you must??

92
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,000
- Hello? - Detective Eun?

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
(Spy, Call Ended)

94
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

95
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, Jae-in.

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,280
Did you confirm the face of the kidnapper?

97
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Not yet.

98
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,040
Jae-in! Oh, no, Jae-in!

99
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,160
Is this the control center?

100
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,680
I called you to add one more CCTV

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,520
in front of Seoheun Police Station. How did it go?

102
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,640
Ah, please wait.

103
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,600
Uh, what happened to the CCTV in front of Seoheun Police Station?

104
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Ah, the prosecutor who came yesterday made a request too,

105
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,120
so we conducted an emergency installation.

106
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
Yes, it has been installed. Is there an issue?

107
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,520
Uh??Someone's been kidnapped in front of the police station

108
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
about two hours ago.

109
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,040
Please call me once you confirm the face of the kidnapper.

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
Alright, let's see.

111
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
Here, here, and here are the roads leading to

112
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,520
the streets without CCTVs. Please block them all.

113
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,600
And please tell them to search all the cars in the area.

114
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,480
- When did you prepare this??- Please hurry.

115
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Yes, I see.

116
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
Will Jae-in be okay?

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Will she be safe?

118
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
Of course, she'll be safe.

119
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,120
I never forgive bastards who kidnap my "kid" from my precinct.

120
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll see you after I return.

121
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,520
Please find Jae-in, please.

122
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,640
Jae-in!

123
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Oh, are you okay?

124
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,240
What the heck? Is he drunk? Let's go.

125
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,040
I won't collapse.

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
I won't die.

127
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
So,

128
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,040
please show yourself, Yoon Jae-in.

129
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,600
Hey, you jerk, why are you here?

130
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,040
Are you searching the streets marked on the map?

131
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
I gave the CCTV map you gave me to all of the units.

132
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
I also told them to be on the lookout for

133
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,360
abandoned houses and storefronts. So you go back, and wait.

134
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,400
I will search this way.

135
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Lieutenant Nam, please search that way.

136
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,080
Lee Ahn.

137
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,920
I have to find her.

138
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,120
I'm sure Jae-in left a trace of her for me.

139
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
If she did, the police can find it.

140
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
No, I am the only one who can see it.

141
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
Please excuse us. We have to inspect your vehicle.

142
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,680
What happened?

143
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
A kidnapping occurred in a nearby area.

144
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

145
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
Please show us your ID.

148
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,680
Please open the trunk.

149
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,840
Detective Lee, he's been identified.

150
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,080
What are you doing? Open the trunk, please.

151
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,960
Thank you for your cooperation.

152
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
(We have secured the photo of the suspect)

153
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,120
Okay.

154
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,400
- Hey, let him pass. - Yes, sir.

155
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,440
Thank you so much.

156
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,000
Ugh, the quality is terrible??

157
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,680
That car??

158
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Catch that car!

159
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
Where are you taking me?

160
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,320

161
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,400

170
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
She's here.

171
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,880
Yoon Jae-in!

172
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Jae-in!

173
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Damn it!

174
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,560
Yoon Jae-in!

175
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
Jae-in!

176
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Jae-in!

177
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,360
No, no! You can't! No!

178
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,320
Jae-in! Wake up, Yoon Jae-in!

179
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,800
Jae-in!

180
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,960
Yoon Jae-in!

181
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,800
Jae-in??

182
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,760
I have something to tell him right now,

183
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
but telling him

184
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,480
won't change the fact that Ahn's parents passed away.

185
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,600
Uncovering the truth that my dad isn't the murderer

186
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,640
would heal my wounds only.

187
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,120
I want to go to him so much.

188
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,240
But I can't.

189
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,800
Don't cry.

190
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Jae-in, don't cry, okay?

191
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,080
Don't cry. It's okay.

192
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,040
I'm sorry I came so late.

193
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Please wake up.

194
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,120
What about Jae-in?

195
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,800
Ahn just called me,

196
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,360
she's stable.

197
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,920
Oh, oh, thank you.

198
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,840
Oh, thank you, God.

199
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
Oh, Buddha, ancestors, thank you.

200
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,480
- What about that??- What about that lunatic?

201
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,040
Has the bastard who kidnapped Jae-in been caught?

202
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,760
Damn it.

203
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
It seems that he abandoned the car and ran away.

204
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
- What should we do? - Isn't it obvious?

205
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,480
Search thoroughly.

206
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,000
If we fail to catch this bastard, Detective Eun will kill us.

207
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,560
- Split up! - Yes, sir.

208
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
If Officer Yoon is safe, that's enough.

209
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,080
Tell them to guard the hospital where Officer Yoon is,

210
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,920
Let's talk about losing that bastard when I get back.

(Muhyeong-ri Community Health Center)

212
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Yes, it was her alright.

213
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,640
We told the prosecutor who came yesterday as well.

214
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,560
Ms. Kim Song-hee left this island.

215
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,080
Left the island? When?

216
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
On December 17.

217
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,560
It was the very day she got treated.

218
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
Could you please explain to me in detail

219
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,200
what happened that day?

220
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,720
Suicide attempt?

221
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
Yes. Well, the local residents found her,

222
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,880
before her life was in danger,

223
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,040
but she seemed unstable somehow.

224
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,840
It's pretty common with people that come here

225
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
when they have no reason to.

226
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,920
So, just in case,

227
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,360
I asked her name and resident registration number,

228
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,000
but she was being stubborn, saying that she wanted to leave

229
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
after paying for her medical bill.

230
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm sure she did it because when medical record remains,

231
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
her whereabouts can be tracked down.

232
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
Anyway, we went back and forth for a long time,

233
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
but when we said that we'll call the police,

234
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,640
she showed us her ID only then.

235
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,160
And then she left right away.

236
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
Plus, she left her ring on the bed.

237
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
A ring?

238
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,120
Yes, she had a ring she kept touching, seemingly out of habit.

239
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,880
We gave it to the prosecutor who came yesterday.

240
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,160
December 17th is the day??

241
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,000
The day we did the briefing about Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young

242
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,880
being murdered by Kim Gap-yong.

243
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,960
Why did she attempt suicide on that very day??

244
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why is she keeping it as a secret from you as well,

245
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,120
when she is still alive?

246
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,920
Just why?

247
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
(Seoheun Medical Center)

248
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Oh, you poor thing.

249
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,720
You must've been so scared.

250
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,200
You must've been so shocked.

251
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,040
Oh, Jae-in.

252
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Jae-in!

253
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Ah, but looks like Kang Sung-mo now has

254
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,400
more than one precious thing.

255
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,160
For me, she is still the only one.

256
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,920
I think Prosecutor Kang's mother is alive.

257
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,360
You miss her too, right? Your mom.

258
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,120
That woman who lived as the dead Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young

259
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,560
is Kang Eun-joo, Prosecutor Kang's mother.

260
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,040
I heard that Jae-in survived

261
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,240
thanks to you finding her early.

262
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,040
Thank you. Thank you so much.

263
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't worry.

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,960
Jae-in is okay now.

265
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,520
I've been telling her that over and over again

266
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,920
on our way here, but she didn't listen.

267
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,360
You should go home and get some rest, too.

268
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,080
You haven't been able to sleep at all, right?

269
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,760
You should get some rest, ma'am.

270
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,160
There are officers watching her, but still??

271
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,040
I want to stay with her.

272
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,560
Still, I have to stay with her.

273
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Sook-ja, aren't you planning to feed her after she's discharged?

274
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,040
Hospital meals won't give her energy.

275
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,600
You think?

276
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,920
Let's go get some groceries before lunchtime is over.

277
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,720
I will prepare abalones and other ingredients,

278
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
so please prepare your love and support, ma'am.

279
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,040
Okay, tell her to call me when she wakes up.

280
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,160
Because I want to hear her voice.

281
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,080
- Okay. - Please.

282
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,160
Let's go.

283
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,920
Where should we go shopping for groceries?

284
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,960
Dad.

285
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,400
I remember your face.

286
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,680
You took my dad's clothes.

287
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,680
It's you, isn't it?

288
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,920
The one who stabbed Ahn,

289
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,840
and the one who's been stalking Prosecutor Kang for a long time.

290
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,040
You were the culprit.

291
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,560
Things will never turn out the way you want them to.

292
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,360
I saw the news about a police officer being rescued

293
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
after she was kidnapped.

294
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,840
It seems that he has come back.

295
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,960
Everything's happening just like you said.

296
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,280
What are you going to do now?

297
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
How much does Ahn know?

298
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,320
Ahn is no longer a kid

299
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,960
crying about seeing weird things.

300
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,120
He knows that man kidnapped Officer Yoon,

301
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,200
so it's only a matter of time until the truth is revealed.

302
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
About who he is??

303
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,000
and

304
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,040
what he had done.

305
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Sung-mo.

306
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,920
At that time, there was no one to help you,

307
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,080
but it's different now.

308
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
Do not

309
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,480
make a hasty decision on your own.

310
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,560
Thinking about it now,

311
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,800
even back then,

312
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,880
I wasn't alone.

313
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,000
I don't know what happened,

314
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,040
but if you neglect wounds like this without treatment,

315
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,720
it festers. Underestimating them

316
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,480
might be fatal.

317
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
If I asked them for help at that time??

318
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
If you need any help, call me.

319
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Let's go.

320
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,240
If I called him when we found out that

321
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,480
he came to us again??

322
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
I regretted

323
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,640
about that day

324
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
over and over again.

325
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,080
I do not want to

326
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
make those who are trying to help me

327
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
get hurt again.

328
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,000
I have to

329
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,880
find a way.

330
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,720
We checked it and the ID was a stolen one.

331
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,960
The car had been rented under a stolen identity as well.

332
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
What about the fingerprints?

333
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,440
We found some in the car, so I sent them to Dr. Hong.

334
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,040
I'll go meet Officer Yoon Jae-in as soon as I get there.

335
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
Did you find Kang Eun-joo?

336
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,200
I checked all of the CCTVs, including the ones at

337
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,120
the nearby bus terminal and platforms,

338
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,520
but there was no trace of Kang Eun-joo.

339
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,360
That means Prosecutor Kang couldn't have met her, huh?

340
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,240
I hear the same thing no matter where I go.

341
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,680
"The prosecutor who came yesterday made copies already."

342
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Somehow following Prosecutor Kang has become my specialty.

343
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,520
Does that mean Prosecutor Kang might not know about

344
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,040
the whereabouts of Kang Eun-joo either?

345
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
Ah, by the way,

346
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,440
I heard that fingerprints were found from the kidnapper's car.

347
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,800
Yes, but as you know, it'll take time to identify him.

348
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,120
Dr. Hong.

349
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,400
I'd like to ask you a favor.

350
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,720
I know.

351
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,800
You want me to keep the story about Kang Sung-mo's mother

352
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,120
as a secret until we can confirm something, right?

353
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Dr. Hong, you're the best.

354
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Detective Eun, you be careful, too.

355
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,680
According to Kang Sung-mo, you could be in danger, too.

356
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,200
I'll see you when I get back.

357
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,160
Let's stay like this for a little more.

358
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,920
You're hurt, too.

359
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
I'll go ask for some ointment. Wait here.

360
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,680
I think I'll get better if we stay like this.

361
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,240
Weren't you scared?

362
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,000
I thought you'd come find me.

363
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,000
I was scared.

364
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,280
I was scared to death, thinking that

365
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,400
I might never hold your hand again.

366
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,480
Ahn.

367
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,480
That bastard??

368
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,000
That bastard who kidnapped me

369
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
took my dad's clothes.

370
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,560
That's why my dad was framed as the culprit,

371
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,320
and now I remembered that face.

372
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,440
I know.

373
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,560
You heard that Prosecutor Kang's mother is alive, right?

374
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,920
I'm sure

375
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,440
that bastard is looking for Prosecutor Kang's mother.

376
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,920
But it's not going well for him, so he's hurting the ones around??

377
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,120
You don't need to explain it to me.

378
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,560
So you've seen everything

379
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,120
that happened in that storage.

380
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
Yes.

381
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
So let's forget about it for a moment,

382
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280
even for just a moment.

383
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,120
You kept crying in your dreams, too.

384
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
And you're saying that again as soon as you wake up.

385
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,920
I am going to

386
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,600
find that bastard, no matter what.

387
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,760
My power can only see

388
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,960
a few out of the thousands of pieces,

389
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,320
but I will

390
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
put those pieces together.

391
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,280
I'm sure you will find

392
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,080
both Prosecutor Kang's mother and that bastard.

393
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,480
I believe in you.

394
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,880
You have to help me.

395
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
You know that without you,

396
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I'm just a psycho,

397
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,160
not a psychometrist.

398
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah.

399
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,120
What are you doing here?

400
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,640
Shhh.

401
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,200
Our visit will only bother them.

402
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,400
Let's just leave them alone.

403
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,360
Okay.

404
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,640
What are you looking at?

405
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,720
Come on.

406
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,160
Stop making a fuss, my heart.

407
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,240
I'm so glad that they ended up together.

408
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,360
Jae-in has been suffering for a long time,

409
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,360
so I do wish for her to be happy now.

410
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,600
Oh, you should care about your happiness more than hers.

411
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,520
What?

412
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,320
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

413
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,800
Ah, by the way,

414
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,000
- what's a psychorist? - What?

415
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,840
Uh, I heard him saying it in the room earlier.

416
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
Psychorist?

417
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Psycho??mattress?

418
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,600
Ah, does it refer to some kind of a professional,

419
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,440
like a guitarist or a cellist?

420
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
Ah??Is it?

421
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,360
Well,

422
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,080
Lee Ahn is a professional psycho, after all.

423
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,640
Right. There's no match for him.

424
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,840
By the way, where? Eun-sol?

425
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,400
Ah, I asked Mr. Hong to babysit her for two hours.

426
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,560
It's been a while since I've had some free time.

427
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
I need to go buy some diapers.

428
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,160
I'm sure you'll need a porter.

429
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,280
I don't.

430
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,160
Prosecutor Kang's mother attempted suicide

431
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,600
on December 17th?

432
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
That was when Kim Gap-yong's murder of real Kang Hee-sook

433
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,080
and Park Soo-young was officially announced.

434
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,120
But why did it have to be that day?

435
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,160
No, more than that??

436
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,520
Why did she have to live under different identities for 13 years,

437
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,680
hiding the fact that she's alive?

438
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,320
I don't understand that.

439
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
My head is filled with question marks, too.

440
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,160
How was Kang Eun-joo alive?

441
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,680
And just who is that bastard?

442
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,400
Why did Kang Sung-mo disappear after hiding everything from us?

443
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,080
Perhaps Sung-mo really is trying to kill him.

444
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,000
If he found out that his mother attempted suicide,

445
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,040
and the fact that bastard

446
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,640
kidnapped Jae-in as well, then??

447
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,120
Ji-soo, we have to stop Sung-mo.

448
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,240
Yes, we have to find both Kang Eun-joo and that bastard

449
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,440
before Sung-mo does something crazy.

450
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,640
Have you found any clues to help us find that bastard?

451
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,960
No, I don't even know his name yet.

452
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
Dr. Hong is trying to identify him with

453
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,760
the fingerprints found in the car,

454
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,640
but it's not an easy thing to do.

455
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,200
If so, wouldn't it be faster

456
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,120
to investigate Prosecutor Kang's mother first?

457
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,000
If we can find out what happened before the Yeongseong case,

458
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,800
I'm sure we'll be able to find out who he is.

459
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,080
If Kang Eun-joo is his target,

460
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,120
then we should find out about their connection first.

461
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm sure he's lurking around us even now,

462
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,040
looking for the clues about Kang Eun-joo.

463
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
Please be careful, Detective Eun.

464
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm fine.

465
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm worried about you, Officer Yoon.

466
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,840
I think I became the target

467
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,040
out of some misunderstanding because Prosecutor Kang

468
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
supported me before.

469
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,920
It's not like he likes me

470
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
or anything like that.

471
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,160
That's not a misunderstanding, Officer Yoon.

472
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,080
That bastard analyzed Sung-mo correctly.

473
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,240
What?

474
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,560
Anyway, what's certain right now is that Kang Sung-mo

475
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,240
and that bastard know each other very well.

476
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,520
They're trying to predict each other's next move

477
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,560
while trying to figure out each other's weaknesses.

478
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,080
I'm sure that's why Kang Sung-mo

479
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,200
couldn't approach you himself

480
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,680
and had Ahn besides you.

481
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Sung-mo might've kept his feelings perfectly

482
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,000
from Ahn or you,

483
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,560
but he couldn't keep it from him.

484
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,120
So Sung-mo knew everything from the start, right?

485
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,800
That this bastard was behind the Yeongseong Apt. and

486
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,160
Hanmin incidents all because of his mother.

487
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,120
I'm sure Kang Sung-mo knew about it already.

488
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,040
The problem is, that bastard is so skilled that Sung-mo couldn't

489
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
catch him all this time, even if he knew that he was the culprit.

490
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,720
This??

491
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,720
This is still here.

492
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,120
I might have to live with this forever.

493
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,480
Wounds that have not been treated on time

494
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,080
become scars.

495
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,080
I heard that a scar is a trace of overcoming a wound,

496
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,160
but why does this one look like it still hurts?

497
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,200
It hurts.

498
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,680
It still does.

499
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,120
The memories from that moment still remain.

500
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,000
Sung-mo suffered

501
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,160
because of him, too.

502
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,880
- What? - He has the same scar

503
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,160
on his ankle, just like Jae-in's wound.

504
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,080
Ji-soo, can you please find out about where Sung-mo lived

505
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,560
before he moved to Yeongseong Apartments?

506
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,080
I was about to do that actually,

507
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,120
but 13 years ago is way too long ago to see anything

508
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,120
with your power.

509
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,480
Regardless of using my power or not,

510
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,640
I want to know.

511
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,680
About who that bastard is.

512
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,040
About why he does this,

513
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,800
and what his connection to Sung-mo is.

514
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,800
If I find out about them,

515
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,440
I think I'll be able to perform better

516
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,080
when my power is really needed.

517
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah. Let's do it together.

518
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,080
Ah, and these are the materials on

519
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,520
the Yeongseong Apt. case, Hanmin Nursing Hospital case,

520
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,880
and the murder case of Kim Gap-yong.

521
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,680
I thought you might be curious about them, Officer Yoon.

522
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,840
Why??are you giving these to me??

523
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,080
Why?

524
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,560
Ahn found out where you were being held

525
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,600
with his psychometry,

526
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,400
so I don't have any reason to wait any longer.

527
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,360
So you're saying

528
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,960
that you will co-investigate with us.

529
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,080
Huh? Am I right?

530
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,360
That sounds too grandiose.

531
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,360
Yeah, let's work together, officially.

532
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,880
Lee Ahn, the psychometrist,

533
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,240
and Officer Yoon.

534
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,360
Are you serious?

535
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,080
I can't perform an investigation while controlling him.

536
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,760
And Officer Yoon, you're the only one who'll put everything

537
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,720
into this case with a sense of duty.

538
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,760
Ji-soo, thank you so much.

539
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,400
Thank you so much, Ji-soo.

540
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,480
Hey, let go.

541
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Ugh, my head is full of complicated thoughts right now.

542
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,520
Don't touch me. Don't read me.

543
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,000
Officer Yoon, what are you doing? Stop him.

544
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,240
Hug her even harder. With my share of hug, too.

545
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Okay.

546
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,440
- Hey, let go. Let me go. - I love you.

547
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,040
Hey, let go. I have something to tell Officer Yoon.

548
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,800
To Jae-in?

549
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,080
Officer Yoon, you see??

550
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,560
I'd like to apologize on my dad's behalf

551
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,000
about your father being framed.

552
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,280
I'm sorry.

553
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,000
I don't know if I'll be able to

554
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,080
pay off this debt by working hard,

555
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,840
but I won't make the same mistake.

556
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,280
Ji-soo.

557
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,360
Are you okay?

558
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,680
Well, I'm used to being dumped by Kang Sung-mo.

559
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,920
See you after she gets discharged.

560
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,600
Excuse me, uh??Do you have a library or a bookstore here?

561
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,920
Over there.

562
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,400
(The Little Prince)

563
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,880
Compared to blocking the CCTVs beforehand

564
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,080
and carefully planning the murder,

565
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,320
the method of murder is quite simple.

566
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,240
Yeongseong Apt., Hanmin Nursing Hospital, and Kim Gap-yong.

567
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,560
They've all been stabbed on the abdomen.

568
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,640
The only notable thing is that

569
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,160
the knife found at the scene wasn't a manufactured product.

570
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,800
What do you mean, it wasn't a manufactured product?

571
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,320
I think he made it himself.

572
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,760
I saw it when he came to the wire crafts class

573
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,320
at the cultural center to check me out.

574
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,600
His skills were extraordinary.

575
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,960
And it is highly possible that he made the chains

576
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,800
he used to tie me as well.

577
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,960
By the way, where have you been?

578
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Ah.

579
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,040
Oh.

580
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,440
"It's the time that you spent on your rose"

581
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,000
"that makes your rose so important."

582
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,200
"You become responsible forever"

583
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,440
"for what you've tamed."

584
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,160
Yes, he mentioned that book.

585
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,080
I read it, hoping to get an idea of his psychological state,

586
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,600
but I don't understand.

587
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,720
For me, it's just a heartwarming tale.

588
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,840
"The time that you spent on your rose"

589
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,080
That means they've known each other for a long time,

590
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,560
long before they moved to Yeongseong Apartments.

591
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,040
Jae-in.

592
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,840
You shouldn't overwork yourself just yet.

593
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
Let's stop here for today.

594
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,000
Now I can really feel it.

595
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,400
That my dad isn't the culprit.

596
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,080
So don't cry again.

597
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,200
Ever.

598
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,520
I won't cry.

599
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,120
Why would I cry, when I have you?

600
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,560
That sounds really nice.

601
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,520
Why?

602
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,400
I like you, Lee Ahn.

603
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,040
I like you, very much.

604
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,400
Well, people say

605
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,040
that your life flashes before your eyes like a panorama

606
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,480
when you think that you're about to die.

607
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,480
That happened to me, too.

608
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,080
And I recalled what I couldn't tell you.

609
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,560
Hey, I was going to say it first.

610
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,440
How could you say it before I do?

611
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,640
Then you should just say it, too.

612
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,160
Hey, that's not, you know,

613
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,840
if that's easy to say, then I would've said it already.

614
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,120
Yeah, okay then,

615
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,480
uh??say it with difficulty, later.

616
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,680
Be honest with me.

617
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,440
You want me to say it to you, right?

618
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,520
Yes, I do.

619
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,000
Why are you so straightforward today?

620
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,040
If you go straight like that, we might have an accident.

621
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,760
A big accident.

622
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,240
Can't I cause a big accident?

623
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,080
Do you even know what you're talking about?

624
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,920
Ugh, seriously.

625
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,520
See? It's good to smile.

626
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,160
Just like how you made me smile

627
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,160
whenever I was having a hard time,

628
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,120
from now on, I'll make you smile

629
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,560
whenever you have a hard time.

630
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,080
I'll do it.

631
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,320
It's okay.

632
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,680
You never listen to me.

633
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,440
The weather is a lot warmer now.

634
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,640
I wish that spring would come soon.

635
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,040
Yeah, that'll be great.

636
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,920
I told you, I'll do it later.

637
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,520
What are you doing? You just left the hospital. This isn't right.

638
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,840
It's not even that dirty.

639
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,200
I tried to stop her, but she wouldn't listen.

640
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,000
This might be my last cleaning here.

641
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,040
I got so attached to this police station.

642
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,880
Last cleaning? What do you mean?

643
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,000
Uh??I think Jae-in will soon

644
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,040
transfer to the special investigation team??

645
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,880
Hi.

646
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,880
We could've come to you if you called.

647
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,520
Why did you come all the way here?

648
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,040
What the heck?

649
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,280
Why did you bring your things here?

650
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,080
Why? Because I'm going to investigate from here.

651
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,120
Here?

652
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,400
Wow.

653
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,680
Uh, I said that I needed you two,

654
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,880
and asked you to investigate with me.

655
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,120
I never said anything about you working at special investigation.

656
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,120
Wow, how could you trick your "brother?"

657
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,200
Did you think that too, Officer Yoon?

658
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,240
Yes, I thought I was going to work at special investigation too??

659
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,840
Ah??So you didn't know.

660
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,040
Special investigation team has temporarily disbanded due to

661
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,760
Prosecutor Kang's absence.

662
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,200
Officially, I mean.

663
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,480
All of those cases, from Yeongseong to the luggage murder,

664
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,320
are all closed, so it's kind of weird to form a team.

665
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,120
So, in a sense, this is my personal investigation.

666
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,200
We've all been dumbed down into one group.

667
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,120
I'm disappointed in you, Officer Yoon.

668
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,000
How does being at a small police station dumb you down?

669
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,400
Lieutenant Nam right here

670
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,400
worked the hardest in this field.

671
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,040
He's not someone you can look down on, for retiring soon.

672
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,160
Does that mean Lieutenant Nam is on our team, too?

673
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,760
Of course.

674
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,000
Wait.

675
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I don't know what's going on, but there's a misunderstanding.

676
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,120
I do not wish to take action and get stabbed

677
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,600
at my age. Not even for a bit.

678
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,120
What the heck?

679
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,360
If so, are you all totally against me?

680
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,840
Should I just go back, then? Huh?

681
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,000
You're not supposed to go back. You're supposed to take us.

682
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
To the special investigation team.

683
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,080
If the special investigation team isn't an option, then to

684
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,280
a criminal team??

685
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,080
You too, Officer Yoon?

686
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,400
How are you going to explain him to the superiors?

687
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,720
You have the title of a junior officer, but he's??

688
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,000
What? What? What?

689
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,200
- Anyway, you can't. - What is this?

690
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,320
You said we're a team, but why do I feel left out?

691
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,880
I'll explain it to you after I come back.

692
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,080
Let's go.

693
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,760
Let me borrow Officer Yoon for a while.

694
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,880
Let's go, let's go.

695
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,920
Wow, it's not that I feel left out,

696
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,400
but I am actually being left out.

(Fire and murder case at Yeongseong Apartments)

698

I am going to re-investigate

699
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,120
the Yeongseong case properly.

700
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,040
- What? - Don't try to stop me.

701

Don't try to stop me.

702
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,360
If you try to stop me again,

703
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,240
that would mean you're really hiding something.

704

Don't disappoint me anymore.

(Congratulations YSS Construction)

708
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,880
I think it makes sense when Officer Yoon said

709
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,080
that the connection was made a long time ago,

710
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,680
so I'm going to go back to the beginning.

711
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,920
Starting from Kang Eun-joo's hometown.

712
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,320
Gangnyeong-si, Gangwon-do.

713
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,600
Yes. She lived there until 1996,

714
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,040
and she changed her address quite often after that.

715
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,960
It feels like she's been to every corner of this country.

716
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,760
If so, she could've been running away from him

717
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,600
since 1996.

718
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,160
Yeah. But there are so many weird things.

719
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,880
First, look at Kang Sung-mo's birth record.

720
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,040
Sung-mo's birthday is May 24, 1988,

721
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,560
but his birth was registered in 1996.

722
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,080
- Nine years after his birth. - What?

723
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,640
His birth wasn't registered for nine years?

724
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,000
In addition, he's registered under Kang Eun-joo,

725
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,920
and there's no record of her spouse.

726
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,600
Then could it be??

727
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,360
You said your father passed away early, right?

728
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,880
What kind of person was he?

729
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,120
You didn't hear anything about Prosecutor Kang's father, right?

730
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,040
Not at all.

731
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,480
I really hope our imagination isn't the reality.

(Gangnyeong Steel Company)

733
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,920
Looks like they've been out of business for a long time.

734
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,720
Let's go inside.

735
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,480
This must've been a steel factory.

736
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,160
It seems like it's been abandoned for a while.

737
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,640
Officer Yoon, go see if you can find anything from

738
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,000
when Sung-mo used to live here.

739
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,080
And Ahn, you know what to do, right?

740
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
Yeah.

741
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,400
Hello, Dr. Hong.

742
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,520
He must've been making

743
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,920
his own knives and chains here.

744
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,080
Wait.

745
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,200
- That's not the way. - What?

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,800
and heads to there.

749
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,760
Someone must've been here recently.

750
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,520
Has he been identified?

751
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,840
Uh, more than that,

752
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,800
I found a cold case in which the fingerprints are a match.

753
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,320
A cold case?

754
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,360
It was in Yeonhae-dong, Gangnyeong, Gangwon-do, in 1996,

755
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,320
and even though the fingerprints of the culprit was found,

756
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,040
it seems that they couldn't identify him either at the time,

757
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,440
so it turned into a cold case.

Wait.

What if he acted, perfectly?

781
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,840
Covered it up as quietly as possible?
