(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,160
Fire safety system? Ha! He's nothing but a security guard.

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,400
It does show that he is a former firefighter, though.

5
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,400
Ugh, a firefighter??

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,800
If a dog barks at its owner,

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,920
then it can't be helped, right?

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,040
It has to be killed, right?

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,440
It should be killed.

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,160
Ugh, what now?

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,560
Who is it?

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
What is it?

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,120
Do you have something to say to me?

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,720
What's that bag?

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Huh? That voice??

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
Oh, no!

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,520
Oh, no! What's wrong?

19
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120

24
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Lee Ahn!

25
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Ahn!

26
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,080
Wake up, Ahn! Ahn!

27
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
No way.

28
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,640
Emergency, emergency.

29
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,680
Unit 702. Lee Ahn is injured.

30
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,080
Currently not breathing, no pulse.

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,160
Call for emergency rescue, call for emergency rescue!

32
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,720
Lee Ahn, are you okay? Are you okay?

33
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Jae-in.

34
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Jae-in.

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
The one who

36
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,080
killed people and caused the fire here

37
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,120
was Sung-mo.

38
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,920
We, we have to find Sung-mo.

39
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,520
The police are looking for him, so you stay here.

40
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,760
If you keep using your power, you might really die.

41
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
I think I know where Sung-mo is.

42
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Ahn!

43
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
Lee Ahn!

44
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Lee Ahn.

45
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Are you okay?

46
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Lee Ahn.

47
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
Officer Yoon, where are you going?

48
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
He said he thinks he knows where Prosecutor Kang is??

49
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,160
Which floor are we going to? 15th floor? The rooftop?

50
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
Lieutenant Nam, please go to the rooftop.

51
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
I'll go to the 15th floor.

52
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Okay.

53
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm too late, aren't I?

54
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,360
I should've come here and asked for help.

55
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,040
But I'm??

56
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,080
- way too late. - Why did you do that?

57
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,040
Did you want to make it look like Kang Geun-taek did it?

58
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Did you kill people and start the fire

59
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,960
to turn him into a criminal?

60
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,480
I figured it out as soon as I saw the body Kang Geun-taek brought.

61
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,320
What his plan was??

62
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
A knife.

63
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Lighters.

64
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Mom's ID.

65
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,120
A body of a woman burnt in a fire.

66
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,520
(Yeongseong Apartments, Yoon Tae-ha)

67
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
And then I thought.

68
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,120
'What can I do

69
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,680
to get us out of this hell?'

70
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
I thought that if I put him into prison

71
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,560
before he found my mother, it would all end.

72
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,480
What is this?

73
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,440
I thought that if a lot more people died,

74
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,600
the more likely the police would look into our case.

75
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I knew it was the wrong choice,

76
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
but I couldn't stop.

77
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,160
It was Kang Geun-taek who planned it

78
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,680
and brought the body,

79
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,960
but it was me, who executed it.

80
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,920
That was when I realized

81
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,640
that no matter how much I want to deny it,

82
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,640
I??

83
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,600
I am the child of a monster.

84
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,320
Then why,

85
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,960
why didn't you run away? Why did you remain on the 7th floor?

86
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,080
You had time to run away!

87
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
Why were you there, and why did you??

88
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
save me?

89
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
Lower your bodies!

90
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
To the stairs! Lower your bodies!

91
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
I was scared??

92
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
and terrified.

93
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,160
I was horrified of what I did.

94
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,080
Ironically,

95
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,480
at the moment I chose to become a monster,

96
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,680
I learned what fear was

97
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,040
and what guilt was for the first time,

98
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,800
so I couldn't move.

99
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,120
So, you felt emotions for the first time then,

100
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
and that's why you saved me?

101
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,160
Yes.

102
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,800
And went to unit 1501 to meet the police officer who

103
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
offered to help me, but it was empty.

104
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
Lieutenant Nam.

105
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,000
It's unit 1501.

106
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Freeze!

107
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm sorry, Ahn.

108
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,480
I'm sorry, Officer Yoon.

109
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,560
You're under arrest

110
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,160
under Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

111
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,520
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say

112
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,240
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

113
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,640
You have the right to an attorney.

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Take him away.

115
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Ms. Kang Eun-joo.

116
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,880
It's all over.

117
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,800
Kang Geun-taek has been caught.

118
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
He's in surgery right now,

119
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo was arrested at the scene, too.

120
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
Detective Park, you stay here.

121
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Yes, sir.

122
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
(Operating Room)

123
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
His skin necrosis was progressing due to sepsis, DIC,

124
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,440
and necrotizing fasciitis,

125
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,560
so we had to amputate his left arm.

126
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,440
Is his life in danger?

127
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,160
We need to move him to the intensive care unit

128
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,320
to see how it goes for now.

129
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,000
Do you admit that you kidnapped and

130
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,320
attempted to murder Kang Geun-taek?

131
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,600
Yes, I do.

132
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I also committed murder and arson at Yeongseong Apartments.

133
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,080
Did you try to frame Kang Geun-taek?

134
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,800
I had only one priority at the time.

135
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,120
It wasn't the pain of others or the truth.

136
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,080
'If I go to prison, what will happen to my mother?'

137
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,360
'Can she deal with Kang Geun-taek all on her own?'

138
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
That was all I was thinking about.

139
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,160
But then why did you let Kang Geun-taek live?

140
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,040
You had enough time to have your revenge.

141
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,360
I didn't let him live.

142
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,600
I just wanted him to die slowly,

143
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,960
suffering.

144
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
He got caught that easily?

145
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,080
Without fighting back?

146
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,760
Ugh, then why did he run away to this place

147
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,960
and leave us to deal with this crap?

148
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Wow, this is driving me nuts.

149
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,480
Officer Yoon.

150
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,160
Is it true that Kang Sung-mo confessed everything?

151
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,040
- Yes. - Ugh, I'm going nuts.

152
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,080
I will find that bastard, no matter what.

153
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,120
So promise me that you will wait.

154
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
Wow, you were always crying about seeing weird things,

155
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,160
but you've grown up, huh?

156
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,320
This is our house? Really?

157
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,880
Now, this looks like a house of a prosecutor.

158
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,080
Anyway, this is my housewarming gift.

159
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,760
Wow, thank you.

160
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,160
(Seized items)

161
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,560
(Item: wallet)

162
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,720
(Item: cell phone)

163
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,680
Kang Sung-mo, where are you?

164
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,640
If you're trying to threaten me with a ledger, then stop it.

165
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
I won't threaten you. I want to make a deal.

166
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,800
A deal?

167
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,120
What is it? Is he making a deal to get himself free?

168
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,160
- Please listen until the end. - What do you want?

169
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,160
I heard that you were interrogated by the police

170
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,320
as a suspect for kidnapping Kang Geun-taek or whoever.

171
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Is that it?

172
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Are you asking me for help in case something goes wrong?

173
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,160
Is that what you want?

174
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,040
That ledger is a complete record of bribery committed

175
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,600
by Dragon Head Hunting, under the direction of YSS,

176
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,280
to the members of the police, the prosecution

177
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,120
and of course, politics and finances.

178
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
And it's quite detailed, too.

179
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,560
Just bring the ledger.

180
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,760
Even if you committed murder,

181
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,120
I'll take care of it without any problems.

182
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,040
Where's the ledger?

183
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Prosecutor General.

184
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,960
That ledger will be a small stone at the bottom of a rock tower.

185
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,760
What on earth are you talking about?

186
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,360
I have to pile up the rocks carefully, one by one,

187
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,720
but I don't have much time.

188
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,320
Let's talk in person. Where are you?

189
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,880
No matter what I have committed,

190
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,440
please don't do anything.

191
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
Leave it to the law and due process.

192
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,120
- What? - And,

193
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
please wait for the day the rock tower is completed.

194
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,200
Continue anxiously holding onto that power,

195
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,040
a power that will collapse one day without any notice.

196
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,160
That's what I want.

197
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,040
That ledger could've helped you avoid a murder charge,

198
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,360
but you??You turned yourself in.

199
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,600
So, where's the ledger right now?

200
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,320
I thought about whom I should ask to

201
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,040
take care of those materials, but there was always only one answer.

202
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,400
Lastly, please pass this message on to Ahn.

203
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm sorry for ruining your past,

204
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
your present,

205
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,520
and your future.

206
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,120
Hi, Jae-in.

207
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,800
I asked Prosecutor Kang about where the ledger containing

208
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,160
YSS Construction's bribery is,

209
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,040
but he changed the subject, perhaps he didn't want to

210
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,840
- leak information. - Changed the subject?

211
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,280
He told me to tell you that

212
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,680
he's sorry for ruining your past, your present,

213
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,600
and your future.

214
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,080
Could the ledger... be there?

215
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,560
Does that mean something to you?

216
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,040
Why did you bring me to a crowded place, for a painting?

217
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,640
Choose what you like.

218
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,120
I'll hang it in my room.

219
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,000
You should hang the one you like in your room.

220
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,640
You're weird.

221
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Oh, this one's awesome.

222
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,320
A wolf, a lion,

223
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,040
and is this a dog?

224
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
I like this one.

225
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,520
Why? Don't you like it?

226
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
I do. I like it.

227
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
The head of the lion stands for the present,

228
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
the wolf stands for the past,

229
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,520
and the dog stands for the future.

230
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,320
You must learn from the past,

231
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,000
and behave carefully in the present,

232
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,440
so you don't ruin your actions in the future??

233
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
That's what it means.

234
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,720
He told me to tell you that

235
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
he's sorry for ruining your past, your present,

236
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
and your future.

237
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,320
Wait??

238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,640
Sung-mo. I have a favor to ask you.

239
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,000
Don't run away anymore.

240
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,080
Don't hurt those who became miserable because of

241
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,240
your wrong choice anymore.

242
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,280
And if you're trying to kill him and kill yourself,

243
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,920
you cannot do that.

244
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
If you do that,

245
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
you will never be forgiven by anyone.

246
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,880
That doesn't only include me, but also those children.

247
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,840
Please don't tell me to

248
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
understand or forgive Sung-mo just yet.

249
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,400
That's way too cruel for me at this moment.

250
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,400
From the current Prosecutor General to assemblypeople,

251
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,400
all kinds of bribery took place under YSS orders.

252
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,560
This is getting way too big.

253
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,120
This isn't smashing a rock with an egg,

254
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,320
but smashing it with a speck of dust.

255
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,040
Prosecutor Kang did commit murder and arson,

256
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,880
but it became a tragedy

257
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,280
because of the corruption in YSS Construction.

258
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,160
You already knew about it, Lieutenant Nam.

259
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,040
Yes, I did.

260
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,280
But those who knew about the corruption and covered it up,

261
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,600
are the ones currently in office.

262
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
If we turn this in to the prosecution, it's only

263
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,080
a matter of time before it becomes another scrap of paper.

264
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,640
Like Prosecutor Kang said,

265
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
this needs power and time.

266
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
What difference does it make if we wait?

267
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,240
Should we just sit here and watch those in the office

268
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,520
pass it from one generation to the next?

269
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
We can't do that.

270
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,520
We started this. We need to end this.

271
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,000
So, how should we end it?

272
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
How?

273
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,880
Wouldn't it be possible with

274
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,240
Commissioner Eun's power?

275
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
I braced myself for it,

276
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,040
but I didn't expect to sit here so quickly.

277
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,160
That ledger is a copy,

278
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,720
and we're keeping the original just in case.

279
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,440
So, are you saying

280
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
that I should be the bomb?

281
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,240
You weren't the only one corrupt in the Yeongseong Apt. case.

282
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,640
Those who kept quiet, neglected it, and complied,

283
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,040
are all in there.

284
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Yes, let's do this.

285
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,480
Gather up the press first.

286
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,640
That's the only thing that can get this thing off the ground.

287
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,520
As of today, two months after we reopened this investigation,

288
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,080
the real culprit behind the murder and arson at Yeongseong Apt.

289
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
has turned himself in after 14 years,

290
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,960
unexpectedly turning the tables on the investigation.

291
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Police Commissioner Eun Byung-ho, who was in charge of the case,

292
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,400
is about to make a statement, drawing attention and curiosity,

293
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,880
The corruption of YSS??

294
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,920
Isn't there anything that will grab the journalists' attention?

295
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Find something to distract them. Cover this up.

296
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,200
First, I'd like to ask for forgiveness

297
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,920
from the victims who died from the Yeongseong Apt. fire

298
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,880
and their families who lost their loved ones.

299
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,000
I confess that I tried to cover up the truth by misconducting

300
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,360
the investigation to curtail the case,

301
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,720
forgetting my duties as an officer of the law,

302
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,680
and receiving bribery from YSS Construction

303
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,520
I confess to receiving bribes that

304
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,400
were in direct violations of my duties as an officer of the law,

305
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,080
and as such, I will be taking responsibility and stepping down.

306
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,000
Everything being reported in the press about

307
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
the corruption of YSS Construction is true and I promise to you

308
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,080
that I will do my best to cooperate with the investigation.

309
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,560
As a public servant who serves the people,

310
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,000
I failed to lead by example, and I humbly apologize once more.

311
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,280
The police exist to protect the people

312
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,480
and to keep law and order.

313
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,560
That is the duty and reason for its existence.

314
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,000
My one hope is that the whole ROK police force,

315
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,640
not be criticized and hated because I have strayed

316
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,560
and lost my sense of duty as an officer of the law.

317
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,520
Now let's wait and see.

318
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,280
If a special team forms, the prosecution's investigation

319
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,080
will begin and all we can do is hope,

320
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
that they fell very far from that tree.

321
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,800
Getting this far is enough for me.

322
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Ah.

323
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,120
This is a lawyer I know well.

324
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
Kang Sung-mo confessed,

325
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,840
so there's no reason to wait any longer.

326
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,040
You need to prepare for a retrial.

327
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Thank you.

328
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,000
Don't say that.

329
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,680
I only added my name to everything you've done.

330
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,840
Officer Yoon.

331
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
You have done so well.

332
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,520
Did you sleep at Dae-bong's house yesterday too?

333
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,120
Yes.

334
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,240
Didn't Dae-bong's father say anything?

335
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
His house is so big,

336
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
I didn't even see him.

337
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
Ah, I've never lived in a house like that before.

338
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Same here.

339
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,360
The Yeongseong Apt. case, triggered by Police Commissioner

340
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,160
Eun Byung-ho's resignation announcement raised doubts

341
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,160
of not only the prosecution and the police, but also those in

342
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,160
the political and financial world, speeding up the investigation.

343
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,200
The police have secured evidence that proves corruption

344
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,840
in YSS Construction and bribery of personnel in

345
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,080
the political and financial world.

346
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,040
The prosecution claimed that the case was being exaggerated

347
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,120
and distorted, but there has been rising criticism over the rights

348
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,600
to the investigation, indictment and maintenance of indictment,

349
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
which are all held exclusively by the prosecution.

350
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,160
As support grew for a national petition demanding

351
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,280
checks and balances of the prosecution,

352
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,120
it has begun a late search and seizure.

353
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Want to??go in with me?

354
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
I'll say hi to him properly later.

355
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,880
I don't think he'd want to say hi

356
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,000
to his daughter's boyfriend in there.

357
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,800
Okay. I'll be back soon.

358
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,080
You look too thin.

359
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,160
You look much better, Dad.

360
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,080
Your aunt has been visiting me often recently.

361
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,880
She told me that you're working very hard.

362
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,200
The culprit confessed,

363
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,160
and the residents at the apartments told the truth.

364
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,040
The lawyer said that it will all work out,

365
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,600
but we still have to wait for three months at least

366
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,520
before the verdict for the new trial is in.

367
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm fine with that.

368
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,840
That's not a big deal.

369
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,880
I'm sorry.

370
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,000
About what?

371
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
Even though it was just for brief moments,

372
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,680
I did doubt you at times.

373
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
I thought you could've been the culprit.

374
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
Jae-in.

375
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,680
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,040
I made you suffer,

377
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,360
and couldn't do my job as a father.

378
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,520
When I think about it, we haven't had

379
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,160
a real date since our first date, right?

380
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,400
Is there anything you want to do?

381
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
Hmm??

382
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,120
There's a lot, but I don't need to do anything.

383
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,160
I don't want to risk my boyfriend's life to go on a date.

384
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,720
Ah??Everyone goes on a date, but I can't.

385
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,720
Ah, right. I've been meaning to tell you.

386
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,160
You, you're not allowed to touch dead bodies anymore.

387
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,560
- What? - Ah, no murder scenes, either.

388
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,120
No, not even murder weapons. No, no, don't touch anything.

389
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,440
Then what should I do?

390
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,840
You? Crime comes in many forms.

391
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,800
Hmm??Missing people, voice phishing,

392
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,760
vault thieves, and so on.

393
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,120
Then what about you?

394
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,440
You shouldn't go to the murder scene either. It's dangerous.

395
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I have to go.

396
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,160
There's a rumor about me being specially promoted.

397
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,920
A special promotion? What about me?

398
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,160
Don't you remember?

399
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,560
At least I have the title of junior officer, there's no way

400
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,880
to explain you to the superiors. That's what Detective Eun said??

401
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,120
I know you're not talking about Ji-soo or Sung-mo on purpose.

402
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But don't do that.

403
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,160
Well, you don't talk about them, so I??

404
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,000
If you neglect a wound, it festers.

405
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,160
That's what your father said.

406
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,680
So I'm not going to ignore or neglect it anymore.

407
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,040
I told you that?

408
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
Do you need to say it for me to know?

409
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,040
Prosecutor Kang's first trial will be held soon.

410
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah.

411
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,760
Are you going?

412
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,040
(Seoul Seoheun Main Police Station)

413
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm telling you again,

414
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,000
but I didn't kill anybody.

415
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,160
Not a single person.

416
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,680
I've been asking him since he woke up at the hospital,

417
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,280
but he says that he didn't kill anybody.

418
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,880
He says that he didn't kill Detective Eun, either.

419
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,520
Let's deal with the charges where we can prove his guilt.

420
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,800
The fake body of Kang Eun-joo at Yeongseong Apartments

421
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,200
has been cremated already, so we can't prove that.

422
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,760
There's no evidence that connects him to Kim Gap-yong either,

423
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160
just the circumstantial evidence of the use of chains.

424
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,880
Then the remaining ones are

425
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,760
the Hanmin Nursing Hospital case and the case of Ji-soo.

426
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,080
A ton of evidence and witnesses for Detective Eun's case,

427
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,000
but the problem is the Hanmin Nursing Hospital case.

428
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,840
If he doesn't sign the confession,

429
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,280
then having Kang Eun-joo take the stand is the only way, right?

430
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,760
That's Kang Geun-taek's goal as well.

431
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,640
So he's trying to see her face one last time?

432
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,480
Wow??He's cruel up until the end.

433
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,000
Having Kang Eun-joo, who was locked up by Kang Geun-taek,

434
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,360
take the stand at the court, is inhumane.

435
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,560
What if he's only in there for 10 years and he goes after her again?

436
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,120
That's even more horrible.

437
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,120
We need to tie him up and put him away for good this time.

438
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,000
Jae-in and I will go meet Kang Eun-joo.

439
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,720
Testify about Hanmin Nursing Hospital?

440
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,520
In front of him?

441
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,040
I know it'll be hard, but that case could be what determines

442
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Kang Geun-taek's sentencing at court.

443
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,840
Can you??do it?

444
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,680
I know I have to do it,

445
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
but could you please??give me some time?

446
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,360
I'll think about it.

447
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,760
I??I have to grab some things.

448
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,480
Can you help me?

449
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,520
Okay.

450
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,040
Did you notice?

451
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,480
Prosecutor Kang's mother

452
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,040
has never called Kang Geun-taek by his name.

453
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I know.

454
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,760
Do you??know the reason behind that, too?

455
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
What is your real name?

456
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,160
Where are you from?

457
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,520
Because she thinks all this happened

458
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,080
because of that name.

459
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,160
Is it true that you have no name and you're undocumented?

460
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,520
Sigh, you must've been abandoned when you were little.

461
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,560
This place is full of people like that.

462
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,760
The owner gathered guys like that only on purpose.

463
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,040
So he can pay them close to nothing.

464
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,240
Hey, get your resident registration number first.

465
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,640
Resident registration??I need a name for it.

466
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,080
Don't you have a random name you've used?

467
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
No.

468
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,360
Really?

469
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,040
Hey, Eun-joo!

470
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,120
You know Chinese characters quite well, right?

471
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,280
Give him a name.

472
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,880
How about Geun-taek?

473
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,200
"Geun" means "root," and "taek" means "house."

474
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,320
Geun-taek?

475
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm sure you've been wandering here and there.

476
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,760
It means you should settle down at one place soon.

477
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
Hey.

478
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,680
Let's go inside and pack.

479
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
I like that name.

480
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,200
What's your name?

481
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,360
Me? I'm Kang Eun-joo.

482
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Then I'll be

483
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,240
Kang Geun-taek.

484
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,840
That must be the memory Kang Eun-joo wants to erase.

485
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Yes.

486
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,400
(Manual)

487
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,600
(Automatic)

488
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay, I'll do it.

489
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
I'll leave after I'm done with this.

491
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,800
You promised Sung-mo.

492
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,120
That you wouldn't cry.

493
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,440
But if you just stay here like this,

494
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,880
then Sung-mo catching Kang Geun-taek

495
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,080
and turning himself in will be meaningless.

496
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,360
I??

497
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,480
I am leaving because if I stay here,

498
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,920
I recall too many memories of Sung-mo.

499
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,400
It's not because of you, Ms. Kang Eun-joo.

500
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,160
There's too much stuff,

501
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,040
so we need to come back later.

502
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Okay.

503
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,720
You eat everything here today, okay?

504
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,400
It's all on me today.

505
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,120
Huh? Really? What's going on?

506
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,160
I didn't think you'd ever become functioning members of society.

507
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,440
But you've all grown up wonderfully.

508
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,960
So as your most admired teacher,

509
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
I should treat you, right?

510
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
Mr. Hong.

511
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
And, since it's on me,

512
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,920
one more person will join us.

513
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
What?

514
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,600
There she comes, just in time.

515
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Here, have a seat.

516
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,240
What about Eun-sol?

517
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,440
Uh, your aunt said that she will babysit her??

518
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,960
So she told me to go and have fun.

519
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,440
Help yourselves.

520
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,160
What the heck? What's going on between you two?

521
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,000
Uh??You see??

522
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,560
While you two were busy, we too

523
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,000
went through some things.

524
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What?

525
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,320
I'll tell you later.

526
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,000
Go ahead and have a drink. Cheers.

527
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,160
Cheers.

528

(Daebong Nara Gas Station)

529
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,000
What?

530
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,640
Did you see it? Did you?

531
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,480
Which side do you think it is?

532
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,240
Does she really hate me with all of her heart? Does she?

533
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,680
Hmm??If I were to mildly exaggerate,

534
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,760
it looks like she finally saw your true charm.

535
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Good luck.

536
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,200
What if she asks you out today all of a sudden?

537
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,800
It's the man's job to ask a woman out, okay?

538
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,840
- Hey, let's toast. - Let's toast!

539
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,040
Come on, come on, gather your glasses.

540
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,240
Gather your glasses.

541
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,320
Cheers.

542
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,160
- Cheers. - Cheers!

543
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,880
Defendant, you have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

544
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,000
Is that correct?

545
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,480
I didn't kill anybody.

546
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,520
That bastard??

547
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,880
Order in the court!

548
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,040
Order!

549
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,120
Is Ms. Kang Eun-joo, the witness from the prosecution, present?

550
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,800
Witness, please take an oath.

551
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,040
Oath.

552
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,280
I will tell the truth,

553
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,120
the whole truth,

554
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,160
and nothing but the truth,

555
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,160
under pains and penalties of perjury.

556
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,800
Prosecutor, you may question her.

557
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,760
Ms. Kang, did you receive a call from Kang Geun-taek

558
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,600
right before the fire at Hanmin Nursing Hospital in 2016?

559
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,080
- Yes. - Did you go there because

560
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,640
Kang Geun-taek, the defendant, threatened to kill

561
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,640
Song Hee-jeong, Yoo Eun-ok, Jung Man-soon, the victims?

562
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
Yes.

563
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,440
Could you please tell us in detail what happened after that?

564
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,680
Yes, I will??

565
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,880
I will tell you everything.

566
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,720
The defendant stabbed the vulnerable victims with a weapon

567
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,800
and committed arson to damage their bodies.

568
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,160
And his criminal activities didn't stop there.

569
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,320
He kidnapped an active police officer,

570
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,840
stabbed and killed another officer and ran away.

571
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,680
And the motive for these crimes, murder, abduction,

572
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,000
desecration of a corpse, and etc. cannot be accepted by the court.

573
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,080
He abused his status as an undocumented individual,

574
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,120
and his crime methods were cruel and unusual.

575
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,200
It is the judgment of the court, that he has felt

576
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,040
no sense of remorse or guilt up to present day.

577
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,480
I hereby sentence the defendant to death.

578
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,520
When we come face to face an uncomfortable past,

579
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,160
even though it might be painful,

580
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,320
we take a step forward through the wound,

581
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,880
(Police Commissioner Eun Byung-ho)

582
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,520
When the hand of a clock ticks for one second,

583
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,480
fair and square for all people,

584
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,000
the present becomes the past.

585
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,680
Some leave a painful past behind

586
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,400
to welcome a new life.

587
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,920
And some

588
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,560
are trapped in the past for eternity,

589
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,640
ruining their remaining future.

590
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,320
The defendant committed murder, taking three apartment

591
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,320
residents' lives, arson, causing a large number of

592
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,160
the residents to lose lives or suffer from property damage.

593
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,160
He has caused tremendous emotional pain

594
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,440
to the surviving families that cannot be healed,

595
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,040
proving the cruelty of the crimes.

596
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,000
And held his biological father hostage with the intent to kill,

597
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,320
calls for a harsh punishment as well.

598
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,080
But he has confessed to his crimes

599
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,160
and has asked for forgiveness from the families of the victims.

600
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,120
He was also confined and assaulted

601
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,560
by his biological father for nine years in the past.

602
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,760
And even after he escaped,

603
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,080
he was forced to live in hiding.

604
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,480
At the time of his crimes, he was legally a minor.

605
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,920
In addition, he suffers from alexithymia, difficulty

606
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,640
with expressing emotions,

607
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,240
With everything taken into consideration,

608
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,520
I hereby sentence the defendant, Kang Sung-mo

609
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,560
to 13 years in prison.

610
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,440
We use all kinds of methods to

611
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,080
treat the wounds from the past,

612
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,000
but the scars remain.

613
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,640
They become unforgettable memories.

614
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,960
They require a long time to fade away.

615
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,280
What kind of memory

616
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,000
will this very moment become for me?

617
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,200
(One year later)

618
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,320
How long are you going to sleep, huh?

619
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,040
Until it's fully charged.

620
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,560
Charged? Nah.

621
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,200
All I did was give you a place to rest your head.

622
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,160
What are you talking about? I was talking about my phone.

623
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,080
Until my phone is charged, I mean.

624
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,120
Ugh, you said you'll study after a short break.

625
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,120
You habitual study skipper.

626
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,760
(Share wireless battery)

627
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,720
(Share wireless battery)

628
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,080
Ugh, is this the only way?

629
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,560
Can't I become a cop solely with my power?

630
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,720
I told you.

631
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,080
There are professional investigation consultants,

632
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,480
but even such civilian experts have a Master's or Ph.D.

633
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,040
This terrible world only cares about diplomas.

634
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,720
That needs to be fixed first.

635
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,560
Still, the detectives are all dying to work with you.

636
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,760
Yesterday, Chief Nam told me to bring you,

637
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,400
but I stopped him, saying that you have to study.

638
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,520
What kind of case was it?

639
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,440
What??What are you doing here?

640
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,040
We arrested two homeless people

641
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,120
hiding in a deserted house.

642
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,960
Recently, someone's been going around

643
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,440
to the homeless to sign them up for life insurance.

644
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,000
It seems that they sign up for the insurance

645
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,160
for a tiny amount of money to buy some soju.

646
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,760
What they don't know is that they just got paid for their lives.

647
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,840
Why are you so obsessed with the homeless?

648
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,640
Kang Geun-taek wandered around without a job all his life by

649
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,680
fabricating the IDs of the homeless, too.

650
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,560
But he never spoke about how he got money

651
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,240
to live day-to-day.

652
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,000
I think this is how.

653
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,280
Stealing the identities of the homeless.

654
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,120
Kang Geun-taek did it for himself.

655
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,920
Dragon Head Hunting was organized.

656
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,160
I'm sure there's a big gang behind it this time too.

657
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,720
Hey, hurry up and put it on.

658
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,080
I have a police exam coming up soon, remember?

659
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,760
Here, smell it.

660
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,160
Ugh, what is that?

661
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,040
Ugh, that smell??

662
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,520
We're all set.

663
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,320
Okay then, scatter and lie down.

664
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

665
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,240
Should I drink a bottle of soju?

666
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,680
Do I have to put this on?

667
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,280
(Seoheun Police Station)

668
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,120
What??What happened to you two?

669
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,200
Oh, my goodness, where did this

670
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,480
pretty beggar and??real beggar come from? Huh?

671
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,080
Sook-ja, I'm starving.

672
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,120
Catching bad guys is a good thing, but look after yourself first.

673
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,320
Dad, since we cleared your name,

674
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,000
should I just quit? Huh?

675
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,360
Being a cop is a lot harder than I thought.

676
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,320
Don't say what you don't mean.

677
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,400
If we lose you, we lose our team.

678
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Don't say that.

679
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,960
Did you hear that, Dad? I'm a big deal.

680
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Go wash up and get changed.

681
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,960
The smell is filling the entire house.

682
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,760
Ugh, good grief. Ugh.

683
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,840
What the heck?

684
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,320
Why is Chief Nam's clothes at our house?

685
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,840
Huh? This is??uh??This is yours, Tae-ha.

686
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,080
That isn't mine, Sook-ja.

687
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,760
It??It isn't?

688
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,000
Sook-ja.

689
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,400
Looks like there's no perfect crime. So let's just??

690
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,600
What are you talking about?

691
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,280
Uh??Get out and wash up.

692
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,760
You, too. Go wash up!

693
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
My underwear is missing.

694
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,000
Ugh, just wash, and??put on whatever.

695
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,040
This jerk Dae-bong isn't answering.

696
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
Hey!

697
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,440
Wow.

698
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,880
Hey, long time, no see.

699
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,040
How are things at the station?

700
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,800
What do you think it's like after a demotion?

701
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,800
Ah, if you "see" any decent cases,

702
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,240
call me right away.

703
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,320
You'll co-investigate them with me, okay?

704
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,640
- Okay. - Promise me.

705
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,120
I'm not doing this because I have something to hide.

706
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,760
- Bye. - Goodbye.

707
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,040
What the heck? That Lee Dae-bong.

708
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
Where is he?

709
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,560
Why are you here every day? What about the gas station?

710
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,320
Hey, the gas station does fine without me,

711
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
but they can't do anything without me here.

712
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,080
When I go in, the crying child just stops crying.

713
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,480
- Give me the car key. - Ah, tomorrow's the exam, right?

714
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,320
Besides the exam,

715
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,960
I have to go somewhere.

716
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,120
Okay. Have a safe trip.

717
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,160
Hey, Lee Dae-bong.

718
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,520
What are you doing?

719
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,560
Oh.

720
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,080
Bye.

721
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
I hear about you from my mother sometimes.

722
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,600
I heard that you're on the investigation team.

723
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,200
It's unofficial for now.

724
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,880
You expected this day to come, didn't you?

725
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,720
So you came back to me, even after you left me,

726
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,480
you made me and Jae-in meet,

727
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,720
and asked Jae-in to train my power.

728
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,400
After that day,

729
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,400
the me who wanted to become human

730
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,280
and the me who was a natural born monster

731
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,120
kept fighting in my head every day.

732
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,360
Sung-mo, I've missed you.

733
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,840
I wondered how betrayed you'd feel

734
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,200
if you knew that I, a murderer, saved you.

735
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
I felt like a monster

736
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,680
as I stood in front of you after I did such a thing,

737
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,000
but at the same time, I was worried about you,

738
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,880
and I missed you, too.

739
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,720
I didn't plan all this

740
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,120
when I returned to you.

741
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,160
Perhaps when I saved you,

742
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,360
when you got that power,

743
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,320
I started.

744
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,080
I wish someone could tell us.

745
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,200
That it's enough.

746
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,600
Resentment, hate,

747
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,360
and self-blame.

748
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,480
That those things can stop now.

749
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,360
(The 1st 2020 Police Officer Examination)

750
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,080
Lee Ahn, did you forget that we're supposed to meet today?

751
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,840
Where are you? How did you do on the exam?

752
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,960
Exam went fine.

753
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,040
I got an urgent call from Dr. Hong, so I came to see her.

754
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,360
I'll come right afterward.

755
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,120
Dr. Hong?

756
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,920
Hey??I told you to not touch dead bodies.

757
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
You stay right there.

758
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
If you die, I'll kill you.

759
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,120
Wow, you came here flying, Senior Officer Yoon?

760
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,440
Dr. Hong, I told you.

761
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,360
If he keeps touching dead bodies, he'll die.

762
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,160
I know.

763
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,080
And I'm not going to be calling him over for a while.

764
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,320
She wanted to give me some books on legal medicine.

765
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,160
Dr. Hong is going on a long trip.

766
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,680
A trip?

767
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,200
I'm a bit tired.

768
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,080
The work isn't fun, either.

769
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,880
If I go and take some time off,

770
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,600
I'm sure I would want to return someday.

771
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,640
So, Senior Officer Yoon, train him until then

772
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,960
so nothing happens if he touches a dead body.

773
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,160
Okay?

774
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Wow, this is great.

775
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,440
Good water pressure, too.

776
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,080
Did you always have money to buy such a house?

777
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,160
Hmm??

778
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,040
I think I can buy two-thirds of it with my money.

779
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,600
Then what about the rest?

780
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,760
Ah??With a loan?

781
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,000
No, with your money.

782
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,840
- What? - Ah??You can get a loan, too.

783
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,480
Uh??I, too, was??thinking of getting a house

784
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,480
with my dad's indemnity, but??

785
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,040
See? You have to move out of the police station, too.

786
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,360
You've been staying there for a long time.

787
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,080
So?

788
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,160
You??want me to live with you??

789
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
There are three rooms.

790
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,120
One for your father, one for me, and one for you and your aunt.

791
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,080
And I poked around,

792
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,120
it seems like your aunt will be moving out soon.

793
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,440
She is just trying to figure out the right timing.

794
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,840
No??with Chief Nam?

795
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,120
Let's live together, Jae-in.

796
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,240
I don't want to live alone. It's lonely.

797
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,720
If my power is going to make living with me uncomfortable??

798
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,080
No, I'm not uncomfortable at all.

799
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,640
Yes, sure, I love it.

800
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,600
Wow, I have a house now.

801
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,320
Do you know what the opposite of noradrenaline,

802
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,080
the thing that stores bad memories in your brain, is?

803
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,000
Hmm??

804
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,280
I don't know.

805
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,080
Beta-Endorphin.

806
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,520
As you smile and laugh more,

807
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,080
it stores good memories in your brain.

808
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,840
Oh, Lee Ahn, look at you. You know so much.

809
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,400
Dr. Hong must be

810
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,000
having a hard time because of her memories of Ji-soo, right?

811
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,640
I hope she doesn't stay lost for too long.

812
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,560
You should stop being lost, too.

813
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,520
I know that you've been only been studying

814
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,280
and not jumping into cases.

815
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,320
It's been more than 416.666666667 days already.

816
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,440
You should stop now.

817

01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,120
I beg you.

01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,440
Hey.

822
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,440
Do you think you can understand medical jargon

823
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,160
that doctors use?

824

(Thank you so much for watching)

825
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,120

(Hahahahaha)

834
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,160
(Director's idea to have Ji-soo unable to enter the autopsy room)

835
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,080
(Ugh)

836

(Lee Ahn giving a tremendous acting performance)

842
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,400
(The perfect final point as well)

843
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,520
Cut.

844
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,760
(Heeheeheeheehee)

845
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,360

(Hahahahaha)

851
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,760
(Landed safely)

852
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,280
(Jin-young is practicing)

853
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,120
(an awesome entrance for Lee Ahn)

854
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,560
Right.

855
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,040
It works.

856
