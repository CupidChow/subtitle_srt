1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,720
(He is Psychometric)

2
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,160
(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,560
Isn't a Christmas tree a bit too early?

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,400
Pretty things are good enough to enjoy for a long time.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,080
Right?

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,640
Ugh, where should I put this star?

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,160
You should put the star on top.

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,840
On top?

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,040
Wow, I should, right?

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,080
There.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
- Is it done? - Yes.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,280
Huh?

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Dad, he's limping again.

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Hey.

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,320
You moved to unit 701 a month ago, right?

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,360
Didn't you go to the hospital yet?

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm fine.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,600
That must've hurt. Your wound festered.

19
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
That would hurt, Dad. Go easy.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,920
How did you get hurt?

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,560
The shape of your wound is??

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
While??

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,200
While I was playing.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,120
I don't know what happened,

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,400
but if you neglect wounds like this without treatment,

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,920
it festers. Underestimating them might be fatal.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
It didn't hurt, so I didn't know.

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,040
You wait here for a moment. I'll go buy some medicine.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
I have to go home.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Then I should go to the police station instead of the pharmacy.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,320
- What? - You have a weird wound,

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,840
but you'll neither go to the hospital nor take medicine,

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,400
and I've never seen your parents since you moved in.

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
Perhaps you're being abused??

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,640
My mom would never do that.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,440
Could you please buy me medicine? I'll take it.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,560
- Jae-in, wait for a moment. - Okay.

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,040
Isn't it pretty?

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,320
Pretty.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Adjective.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,080
The visuals are beautiful, and it's good to see with eyes.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,560
The behavior or gestures are lovely or cute.

43
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,840
So that's how it is, right?

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,520
"Adjective."

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,880
I don't know about such a difficult word,

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,160
but "pretty" means??Um??

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,200
This?

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
You smiled.

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
(PSYCHOMETRY A combination of Greek words)

(He is Psychometric, Episode 7)

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,480
Enough with the silence and get on with it.

55
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
They don't know about it yet, right?

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,240
About their connection.

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,240
Well, it's only a matter of time until they find out.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
Why do they have to find out about it?

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,080
Why are you making them stay together?

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,840
If Ahn reveals something through psychometry,

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,160
I think it'd be that incident from 13 years ago.

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,920
Officer Yoon Jae-in thinks that her father isn't the real culprit,

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,960
and Ahn wants to solve it with his power.

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Is the answer good enough?

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,000
If Officer Yoon finds out that her father

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
killed Ahn's parents??

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
No,

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
if Ahn finds out that Officer Yoon's father

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,120
killed his parents??

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Damn it, which one of them would get hurt more?

71
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,080
I didn't know what it's like to be

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
hurt from a broken heart.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,640
- What? - But even if we get hurt,

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,120
there are truths that we need to know.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,160
Do you think that Officer Yoon's father isn't the real culprit?

76
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,040
If so, is the one who stabbed Ahn, the real culprit?

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Just who is that person anyway?

78
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Trying to solve a mystery I wasn't able to solve

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,480
my entire life all at once is greedy.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,720
Is it okay for me to solve it, anyway?

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
If I tell you not to, will you not solve it?

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,640
If you tell me not to, then I'll solve it even more.

83
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Where's the bus that goes to my house?

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
I want to take a taxi.

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,480
But we're going to take a bus.

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Did you forget? I hate buses.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
I hate crowded places.

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
So you need to take it even more.

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
I purposefully plan on holding the next lesson at

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,040
a place you hate.

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,480
Hey, I was just overworked with psychometry

92
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
and collapsed.

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,080
I knew that you bleed from your nose when you're focused,

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,520
but do you even collapse when it's too much?

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,280
I collapsed for the first time today.

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Would I die, if it gets worse?

97
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,280
Hey, don't you need to go to a hospital and get a checkup?

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
What checkup? On my brain?

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,080
Ugh, you don't always come up with a good idea, though you're smart.

100
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,840
Did you forget?

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,000
This brain of mine has an extraordinary power.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you afraid that NASA will take you and investigate you?

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,080
Perhaps NASA might dissect my brain and put it in alcohol.

104
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,000
You've read too many comic books.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,680
Hey, how can you say such a horrible thing like it's nothing?

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,040
What I saw earlier while I was in a coma was more horrible.

107
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,800
The pain really felt like I was being hit on my head.

108
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,400
Ah, so, please just let me take a taxi home, okay?

109
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,120
Alright.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
Today's taxi ride is a reward.

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,120
From tomorrow on, I'll only pick the things you hate

112
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
on purpose and train you, so brace yourself, okay?

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,600
Sure. Anyplace is fine, except for the library.

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,360
Hey, you try hailing a taxi too.

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,400
Why did he kill them?

116
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,240
And why did he die?

117
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,200
- What? - He killed two women.

118
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
That man named Kim Gap-yong.

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,040
And then he was killed by someone.

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
About the fake Kang Hee-sook, you saw with psychometry

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,280
at the autopsy room for the first time.

122
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,000
The one wearing a ring.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
Do you remember anything else about her?

124
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
It's been

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
two years already.

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,480
It'd be weird if I actually remember something.

127
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,040
But I remember everything about you from two years ago.

128
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,360
What??do you mean??by that?

129
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,640
Because you were so peculiar.

130
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,280
Ah, ah??

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,040
Hi, Auntie.

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't get shocked and listen to me.

133
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Tae-ha??

134
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,480
No, your dad??

135
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Taxi??

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Taxi!

137
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
Taxi!

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,080
What happened?

139
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
I have to go now.

140
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
Is it that thing again? Hyperventilation?

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,040
A bag, do you have a bag?

142
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't.

143
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,560
Don't worry.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
I won't touch you until you allow me to.

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,440
You'll be able to breathe if I do this.

146
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll go by myself.

147
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,160
Wait here.

148
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,120
Dad, please??

149
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,640
Dad, please don't die.

150
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Go.

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,720
Your dad died as of today.

152
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,480
Now live your life, pretend that you don't have a dad.

153
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
Don't you feel like it's unfair that you have to live like this?

154
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,840
It'll be more unfair if you waste your life

155
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,280
because of me.

156
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,120
My life is over already.

157
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,560
It's not over yet.

158
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,160
Ugh, I was just about to begin. Why are you doing this?

159
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
Why do you sound so defeated?

160
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,320
Dad.

161
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,520
You told me.

162
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,520
That if you neglect a wound, it will fester.

163
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,760
That you may die from a small wound.

164
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Dad.

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I??

166
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,120
I will do it.

167
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
So, please

168
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,120
don't be so defeated.

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Huh?

170
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Is it for me?

171
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
Well done, little one.

172
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,360
Alright, one is for you, and the other one

173
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,080
is for the prettiest girl out there, okay?

174
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,920
She's really sad right now,

175
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,040
so it'd be great to hug her, but??

176
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,320
Hmm??

177
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,400
But if you don't want to do it, you don't need to do it, okay?

178
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,600
You can go hug her.

179
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm asking you to do it because I can't.

180
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,160
Can't I just eat two, like you?

181
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,760
Then you'll get cavities in all of your teeth, you brat.

182
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Have you been to the dentist?

183
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,000
You'll realize that the children's hospital is heaven.

184
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,120
Well done.

185
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,000
- Go. - I hate the dentist too.

186
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, hi.

187
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Let's just go home.

188
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Okay.

189
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,760
Here, take them.

190
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Take all of them.

191
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
You, you can have two.

192
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,400
- I want a green one. - I want a red one.

193
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
Is your dad okay?

194
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,840
Ah, I just saw you say??"Dad."

195
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
I don't know anything else.

196
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,920
He's okay.

197
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,520
And thank you.

198
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,080
By the way, we did both theory and practice on the first day, right?

199
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,320
By the way, I've been curious about this for a long time.

200
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,200
Where should you touch for good psychometry?

201
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,280
Huh? First??Hands, I guess.

202
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,440
Perhaps because the skin on fingertips is the most sensitive.

203
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Sensitive skin??

204
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
So it's about touch.

205
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,080
By the way, didn't we have this conversation before?

206
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,360
No? It's my first time asking this.

207
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,320
If so??The most sensitive part is??

208
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,080
But the most sensitive part is??

209
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,560
The lips, right?

210
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,320
How about it?

211
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,160
Want to try psychometry?

212
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,000
The most sensitive part would be??

213
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
- the lips? - The index finger?

214
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
Right. It would be the index finger.

215
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
What are you thinking of?

216
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,360
I know, right? Silly me??

217
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Right, that's why E.T. shared his feelings with that very finger.

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,040
I'm leaving. Bye.

219
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
- Be careful on your way home. - Okay.

220
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Are you done talking to Ji-soo?

221
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,040
Are you going to be late again?

222
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,480
Don't wait for me, and go to sleep.

223
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
Did you forget that I collapsed today?

224
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Aren't you even worried about me?

225
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,280
You're making me solicit all the time.

226
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,280
You mean solitary.

227
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Yeah, you know about it and you're doing this to me?

228
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,760
Make sure you come home today.

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,120
I won't let you get away with it tonight, so brace yourself.

230
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
You keep avoiding touching things by instinct,

231
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,120
so your power isn't improving.

232
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Even if you hate performing psychometry on random things,

233
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,840
if you are going to conduct an investigation with that,

234
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,720
don't avoid touching things.

235
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,080
Alright, alright.

236
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
(Unlocked)

237
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
It's okay, it's okay.

238
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,920
You were scared, weren't you?

239
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,840
Right. Was it like??7 o'clock?

240
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,000
We got a complaint call about a dog barking very loudly.

241
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,960
- At 7 o'clock? - Ah, yes.

242
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
Uh??Is anything??stolen by any chance?

243
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,440
Can we check the CCTV, please?

244
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,560
- Sung-mo. - Ah??About CCTV??

245
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,520
They were going to run some tests,

246
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
so the recording has stopped for a while.

247
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,000
- CCTV tests? - Ah, yes.

248
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
Was this scheduled?

249
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,560
No, somebody just reported that it was broken.

250
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,760
I see.

251
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,760
It's him, Sung-mo. I'm sure.

252
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,120
I checked here and there.

253
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
But there isn't anything??gone??

254
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,040
There is.

255
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,280
Did he take your photo?

256
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,360
Yes.

257
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,000
You know who this person is, right?

258
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
- No. - He took your photo.

259
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,200
And you say you don't know who he is?

260
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,840
Don't you feel like it's unfair that you have to live like this?

261
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,840
It'll be more unfair if you waste your life

262
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
because of me.

263
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,560
When did you get here?

264
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,200
"Are you okay?" "Is it painful?" and "Don't worry."

265
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,160
Let's skip all that, Auntie.

266
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,040
I've heard all that too many times over the years.

267
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,400
Have you eaten?

268
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,040
I've heard that even more.

269
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,080
Let's go inside, okay?

270
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,040
Do you remember the day I left you?

271
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,320
Sung-mo, I've missed you.

272
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,160
I got these because I knew you were coming.

273
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,080
Ta-da!

274
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,040
Have you been studying hard?

275
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Yes.

276
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,360
Ahn.

277
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,520
I don't think I can come here for a while.

278
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,960
Why not?

279
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
I have to go far away to study.

280
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,600
Can I, can I come with you? Huh?

281
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Why are you sorry?

283
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,320
You're going to come back. You're going to come and see me.

284
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,760
Sung-mo.

285
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,320
My plan at that time was to never return to Korea.

286
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Never.

287
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,880
Why?

288
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
Because of him.

289
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,160
Did you run away from him?

290
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,040
Then, why did you come back?

291
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,040
Because it seems like I have to find him now.

292
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,640
I will find this person

293
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,040
and kill him.

294
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,040
Hmmm, it's nice and cozy.

295
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,360
Would you like something to drink??

296
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Who are you living here with?

297
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,680
I heard that it was office-residence.

298
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,720
I live with my aunt.

299
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
You wish to work on a criminal team?

300
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Yes.

301
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,120
I've heard about your father from Prosecutor Kang.

302
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,000
Can you please tell me about what happened on that day?

303
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Everything you remember.

304
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,680
My father, who is now the Commissioner,

305
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,880
was in charge of investigating the Yeongseong Apartments fire.

306
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,960
My dad says that there were no mistakes in that investigation,

307
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,920
but you never know.

308
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,760
I don't have clear evidence about

309
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,280
my dad being innocent, but??

310
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,000
The only evidence that proved my dad was the culprit.

311
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,920
That bothers me.

312
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,120
The only evidence??

313
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
You mean the bloodstained security guard uniform?

314
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,120
Yes, that's right.

315
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,080
What I remember is that he put

316
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,080
the uniform over me before he went over there.

317
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,480
Stay inside.

318
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
- Okay. - Okay.

319
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Stay inside.

320
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,800
To you?

321
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,240
Yes, but it was when I was really young,

322
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,160
so I'm not sure if it's my memory

323
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,040
or my imagination.

324
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,720
If it's a false memory, then??

325
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
Then my father must be the real culprit.

326
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
But if it isn't my imagination,

327
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,400
then I will find out.

328
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
About who took that uniform.

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,920
So you want Ahn to get a reading of that day.

330
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Yes.

331
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,080
I will find this person

332
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
and kill him.

333
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,680
I think Prosecutor Kang

334
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,760
wants to ask you for help, for some reason.

335
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,360
He's the only person whom your psychometry doesn't work on,

336
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,920
and that might mean that he totally shut down his heart.

337
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,040
And I'm sure he's been lonely as much, too.

338
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,880
There must be a reason for that as well.

339
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,000
I will find that bastard

340
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,560
no matter what.

341
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,400
(Running)

342
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Where did I park my car?

343
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
Ah, I don't have a car, right?

344
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Get in.

345
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
What the heck?

346
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Still, running made me feel a little bit better.

347
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,120
That's a lot of cash.

348
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,360
You found this??In front of the daycare?

349
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,400
Is there an ID in there?

350
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,480
ID?

351
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,920
There's no ID.

352
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,680
The credit card says??

353
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,760
Lee??Dae-bong?

354
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,120
Good morning.

355
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
Or not.

356
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,720
- Hey, Lee Dae-bong. - Huh?

357
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,000
Did you drop your wallet in front of the daycare?

358
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
My wallet??

359
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah.

360
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,080
So-hyun found it in the morning. Here.

361
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,160
So-hyun?

362
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,240
Kim So-hyun, Kim So-hyun!

363
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,080
He must be so happy.

364
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,520
Looks like he dropped it on purpose.

365
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,840
Why would he drop it on purpose?

366
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,680
I saw tons of coupons for

367
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,840
Dae-bong's gas station in So-hyun's car.

368
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,680
But what do coupons have to do with the wallet?

369
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,080
Because you want to do anything for the one you love.

370
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,440
If Dae-bong's feelings from two years ago are still there.

371
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,280
So-hyun.

372
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,120
Kim So-hyun, wait.

373
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,960
- Why? - Thanks for finding my wallet.

374
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,280
No need to thank me. The Police Station is right there.

375
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,000
Still, if someone else found it,

376
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,600
he or she might've taken it. I'll reward you.

377
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,120
I saw it on a courtroom show, I have to give you one-tenth.

378
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,040
You think I'm some kind of a beggar?

379
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,640
I saw that coming.

380
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,120
So, are you thinking that

381
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,160
Dae-bong dropped his wallet on purpose so he can

382
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,240
give reward to So-hyun?

383
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,520
Isn't it obvious?

384
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,080
He left it on the path where So-hyun takes

385
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,680
in front of the daycare, so obviously.

386
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,120
I bet both of my hands on the fact that

387
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,240
Dae-bong isn't smart enough to be so calculating

388
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,640
and drop his wallet on purpose.

389
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,480
Hey, those hands aren't yours anymore.

390
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,040
You can't just bet with them like that.

391
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,120
If they're not mine, then whose are they?

392
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,520
Let's say that they're public properties for a while.

393
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
Public??propellers??

394
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
Not propellers.

395
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,520
I know, I know.

396
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,240
Then what is it?

397
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,440
I know.

398
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,200
(Park Soo-young / Kang Hee-sook)

399
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,240
Don't these three look alike?

400
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,640
Park Soo-young, Kang Hee-sook,

401
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,240
and the fake Kang Hee-sook.

402
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,080
- Do they? - Look closely.

403
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,640
If Kim Gap-yong killed both Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook,

404
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,360
then my guess is that this woman is

405
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
also connected to Park Soo-young.

406
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,320
Ah, so you mean the fake Kang Hee-sook might've

407
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,160
lived as Park Soo-young before she lived as Kang Hee-sook?

408
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,320
Exactly.

409
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
I think so, too.

410
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
Park Soo-young had been locked up in a mental hospital

411
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,440
for a long time, as a Jane Doe.

412
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,240
But from 2009 to 2013, there are credit card transactions

413
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,320
and a record of her entering and exiting the country.

414
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,400
There's no record after she entered Korea in 2013.

415
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,240
I think she changed her identity once more around that time.

416
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,720
- From Park Soo-young??- To Kang Hee-sook?

417
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,440
By the way, what's the ground for Kim Gap-yong

418
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,880
murdering Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook?

419
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,760
- Huh? - Was evidence found on the body?

420
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,520
You went to the autopsy room yesterday, and then suddenly

421
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,040
you told me to look into Kim Gap-yong as he's the culprit.

422
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,200
Ah, that.

423
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,160
There was a witness.

424
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,280
Who is it?

425
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,080
I don't see any witnesses in the materials I received.

426
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
An anonymous reporter.

427
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,720
Are you sure that this is trustworthy?

428
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, it's even more trustworthy than you.

429
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,120
So, what about the materials on Kim Gap-yong?

430
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,240
Uh, you see??I don't know why we should dig into Kim Gap-yong??

431
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,360
So you didn't do it yet?

432
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,960
I will start right now.

433
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,320
Ugh, I really wonder how he got into special investigation team.

434
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,320
Today, you'll read books about psychological laws and crimes.

435
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,120
Yeah, sure, they'll all be beneficial to me.

436
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,880
And this.

437
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,080
(New Age Korean Dictionary)

438
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,400
Aren't you looking down on me a little too much?

439
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,960
And don't forget to write your opinions in the notebook.

440
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,040
Ugh, Korean dictionary??

441
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,360
(Public Property)

442
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,000
A property shared by two or more people.

443
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Aha, I see.

444
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
I might be ignorant, but I knew that at least.

445
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,280
But why is she sharing my hands?

446
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,720
What the heck?

447
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,360
Hey, should I go and apologize?

448
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,040
Yikes, that scared me. Are you still here?

449
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,480
So-hyun seems pretty angry, right?

450
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,200
Did you drop your wallet on purpose?

451
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,280
What? You think I'm crazy?

452
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,760
Still, it'd be better to go and apologize, right?

453
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,240
Go away. Can't you see that I'm studying?

454
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,080
So much for studying. You're here for Yoon Jae-in.

455
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,360
In order for me to be upgraded as quickly as possible,

456
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,000
I need to be polished, tightened and oiled,

457
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,720
so you go back to the gas station.

458
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Ah??What't the use of making money? I can't spend it.

459
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,240
You can spend it. Spend it on me.

460
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,480
Am I nothing to you?

461
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,160
Hey, ugh.

462
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,840
You keep it.

463
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,880
I love you, Lee Dae-bong.

464
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,960
I really, really love you.

465
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,280
You jerk, you dropped it on purpose.

466
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,080
Were you always such a sly jerk who uses cheap tricks?

467
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,680
- No. - I cancel "I love you," you jerk.

468
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,160
Wow.

469
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

470
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,760
(Name of the finder of a lost item: Kim So-hyun)

471
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
Wow, Officer Yoon, did you solve one today already?

472
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm not sure if this can be said that it's solved.

473
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,680
Those are all the necessities of human lives.

474
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,440
I caught drug criminals, robbers,

475
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,560
gangs and anything else you can imagine,

476
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,880
but they're that special.

477
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,400
So much for gangs.

478
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,320
It's true. It is.

479
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,680
This is what's true. Genuine.

480
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,040
Lieutenant Nam, let's see.

481
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,120
Wow, how could your whole life be full of knock-offs?

482
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,200
Does it even tell time? Hm?

483
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,080
Auntie, he helped you when you were a victim of fraud.

484
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,800
- Don't do that. - Right.

485
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,920
Ma'am, you still don't know how dangerous

486
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,160
what you did was at the time.

487
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,760
Such bluffing.

488
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,640
You just caught some jerks at the employment agency.

489
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,480
You see, cases begin with small things.

490
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,080
I began investigating it after receiving your report,

491
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,440
but it wasn't an employment agency. It was a gang hideout.

492
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
At that moment, I had a hunch as an expert,

493
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
I had to risk my life for it.

494
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,160
Now, comes the 17:1 battle.

495
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,480
It was 23:1.

496
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
You were one of the 23, huh?

497
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,840
Just eat your food.

498
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,600
Stop it.

499
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,080
Ah, Auntie, my friend is at the library,

500
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,040
- so I'll take this with me. - Okay.

501
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,360
You were crying as you said that they took your ID

502
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,200
and everything. And then snot kept dripping into your mouth

503
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
and got mixed with your saliva. Do you have amnesia?

504
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
So, would you like me to serve you as my savior?

505
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
Oh, the savior of my life.

506
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,960
Of course, you should.

507
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Those gangster jerks fabricated people's identity and sold them.

508
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,440
There was a rumor about them murdering people, too.

509
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,800
Fabricate people's identity?

510
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,360
So, what happened to those gangs?

511
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,440
Isn't it obvious?

512
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,960
The greatest sweep in the history of the police took place.

513
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,360
By who? By me.

514
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,120
What kind of gangs were they specifically?

515
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,280
Please tell me in detail.

516
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,320
This is Kim Gap-yong's file.

517
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,000
And he has quite the history.

518
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,320
Fraud, violence, blackmailing.

519
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,960
Most of them ended as suspension of indictment, though.

520
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,160
- Thank you so much. - Don't you remember?

521
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,800
It turns out that you met him as an assailant

522
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,760
when you were a new prosecutor.

523
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
- Really? - You'll remember if you see him.

524
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,480
Dragon Employment Agency, where Kim Gap-yong was

525
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,040
an action-taker at, was a new type of human trafficking gang,

526
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,520
active in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do.

527
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,320
Most of the victims are the old and the weak,

528
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,880
the homeless, the vagrants, and the debtors.

529
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,160
They sent men to islands or fishing boats,

530
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,040
and sent women to prostitution.

531
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,120
They made false passports and burner phones

532
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,440
by stealing their IDs to acquire a secondary profit.

533
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,280
Which means, they did all kinds of crap.

534
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,640
This sounds like a big gang, even bigger than I thought.

535
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,320
Yup, we only cut off their tails, every time we caught them,

536
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,600
so it must've grown into an unimaginable size by now.

537
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,440
I, too, have experiences in only cutting tails off when I was new.

538
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,000
It means they're a group we shouldn't act hastily with.

539
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,680
Well, at least, let's think that

540
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,000
their head is still out there.

541
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
At least one of them must know something about

542
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
Kang Hee-sook and Park Soo-young.

543
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,880
If we're lucky, we'll make a sweep and receive commendation?

544
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,960
Yes, Detective Lee.

545
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,640
Let's survive and receive commendation together.

546
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,960
Does that mean we may die?

547
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,000
If so, I'd like to apply for leave, starting today??

548
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,720
Let's go and see what kind of bastards they are.

549
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,960
We're not on our way to shut down a small shop.

550
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,040
Wait.

551
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:16,960
"If a psychopath and a sociopath fight,

552
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,560
which one would win?"

553
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,280
Look at that handwriting.

554
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
(Difficulty in expressing emotions, "Alexithymia")

555
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,200
What is this?

556
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,480
Alexithymia?

557
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
Difficulty in expressing emotions?

558
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,080
Can't feel emotions?

559
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,040
Wow, what a weirdo. Damn it.

560
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

561
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I would like to borrow these too, please.

562
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,440
Korean dictionaries aren't available to be borrowed.

563
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,320
But can't you borrow all the books in here?

564
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,040
These are the exceptions.

565
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,160
That's weird.

566
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,040
Yoon Jae-in said that I can borrow all of them.

567
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,440
Wait.

568
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,480
I really, really love you.

569
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,040
If you have any social prejudice about me and that's why

570
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,280
you won't let me rent it, then it's a misunderstanding.

571
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,680
It's not social prejudice. It's conventional wisdom.

572
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,040
That two-timing is bad.

573
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,120
Ugh, that's the misunderstanding. Prejudice or wisdom.

574
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,840
I live with my "brother" at an office apartment,

575
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,680
and that guy was my friend,

576
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,880
and she is the one I like??

577
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,720
Hey, Lee Ahn. Come out. Now.

578
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,920
I just heard something really important.

579
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,680
You heard?

580
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,680
You should hear something like that while receiving flowers.

581
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
- Were you surprised? - There was a huge gang

582
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,120
called Dragon Employment Agency that bought and sold identities.

583
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,280
It has been disintegrated now,

584
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,120
I mean, the gang broke up and the members scattered,

585
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,960
but anyway, their headquarter still remains.

586
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,360
Dragon Employment Agency?

587
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,000
Don't you feel something?

588
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,120
Kang Hee-sook, Park Soo-young and Kim Gap-yong.

589
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,960
They sold and bought identities.

590
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,920
Ah, Kim Gap-yong?

591
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,680
What is with this boring reaction?

592
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
What is this important thing you mentioned before?

593
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,280
Nevermind. I'm glad that you didn't hear it.

594
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,400
So, where is this remaining headquarter at?

595
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,400
Ugh.

596
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,680
- What is this? - Why? Can't you shoot it well?

597
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,160
Give it to me.

598
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,360
I once entered a shooting competition

599
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,480
and won an award in my heyday.

600
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,720
Watch.

601
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,400
If I shoot 10 bullets, then I make 11 hits.

602
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,600
Wow!

603
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm even better with a bow and arrow.

604
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,240
Okay, watch carefully.

605
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,280
Lick it first.

606
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,760
Ugh, it's dirty.

607
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,000
No, it's not dirty.

608
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,680
Okay, do this, and??

609
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,360
See? This is who I am.

610
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,760
One hit, knock-out.

611
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,480
Oh, my.

612
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,320
Ma'am, did my students do it?

613
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,000
I told you not to shoot it at people.

614
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,040
Ugh.

615
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,360
At least it's cute when kids do it.

616
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,000
So much for an award at a shooting competition.

617
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
I even won an award at a running competition.

618
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,160
Ugh, how frustrating!

619
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,760
- Is this the place? - Yes.

620
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,880
Lieutenant Nam said that Dragon Employment Agency is here.

621
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,240
Here it is.

622
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,120
(DRAGON HEAD HUNTING)

623
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,880
Ah??okay??I see.

624
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,440
Do they use this entire building?

625
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,520
Are you sure we're at the right place?

626
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,520
Dragon Employment Agency or Head Hunting. Same difference.

627
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,400
I heard they failed, but looks like they're still in business.

628
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,760
Ah, something doesn't??feel good.

629
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,000
Are you going to start predicting the future now too?

630
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,240
Le'ts just take a peek and go.

631
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,720
Having a touch would be better.

632
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,600
Yeah, I'm better in practice than theory.

633
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,480
Ugh, if this gang didn't break up,

634
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,360
then I could've done something.

635
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,040
Welcome.

636
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,080
Is this your first time at Dragon Head Hunting?

637
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,320
- Yes. - Please come this way.

638
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,960
Is this what you consider "disintegrated?"

639
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,080
This isn't disintegrated.

640
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,240
This seems like a misunderstanding.

641
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,040
You don't want a regular backup troop,

642
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,760
but a full-scale backup troop?

643
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,120
Everyone knows that this gang

644
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,960
has something fishy behind them.

645
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,880
So, why do you have to sweep that gang right now?

646
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,280
Aren't you two investigating about the luggage murder case?

647
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,120
For now, I will only tell you that the luggage murder case

648
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,440
and that gang are connected for sure.

649
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,960
So, I just need to know about that for now, huh?

650
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,000
We're not at the stage to explain it right now.

651
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,960
Why can't you explain it?

652
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,000
I heard that the two bodies found at the stream

653
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,720
were murdered by Kim Gap-yong, the action-taker of that gang.

654
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,200
Kim Gap-yong is the witness in the Hanmin case, right?

655
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,120
Who told you that?

656
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,200
It's still classified.

657
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,600
Well said. What's weird

658
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,400
about me knowing about classified information? I'm the Commissioner.

659
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,960
I'm not an outsider. I'm an insider. You jerk.

660
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,480
Wow??

661
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,560
You sent a spy after your daughter?

662
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,400
- Uh??Detective Eun? - Yeah, I did. So what?

663
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,120
- Commissioner. - I will not provide any backup

664
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,960
until you bring concrete evidence and witnesses about

665
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,400
the two women being murdered by

666
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,800
that gang, so keep that in mind.

667
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,760
Detective Eun, the meticulous, must find the spy first.

668
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,080
I don't need to find the spy.

669
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,440
It's obviously Detective Lee.

670
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,840
I could smell privileged employment from him.

671
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,040
You speak of privileges, as the daughter of the Commissioner?

672
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,000
I got her on my own, come on.

673
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
Anyway, we can't make Commissioner Eun understand

674
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,520
the connection between the luggage case and Kim Gap-yong.

675
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,000
I know.

676
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,480
We can't tell him that Ahn can do psychometry.

677
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,760
Ugh, but we can't just break into that place unarmed.

678
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,000
Give me some time.

679
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,200
I will think of a way.

680
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,680
Welcome.

681
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,080
Do you have a Dragon Head Hunting membership?

682
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,120
This is my first time here.

683
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,920
Oh, may I see your ID, please?

684
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,880
I didn't bring it??

685
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,640
Ah, I'm 25 years old,

686
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,720
and my name is Yoon Jae??soon.

687
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,080
Yes, I'm 25 years old, too.

688
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,600
I'm Lee Ahn??dong.

689
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,560
You should be working hard at that age.

690
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,240
Are you two dating?

691
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,960
- No. - Yes.

692
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
- Yes. - No.

693
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,040
It's the perfect age to work and date, right?

694
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,320
Here, this is the membership application.

695
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,760
There's no fee to sign up.

696
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,720
And the fee for the first brokerage is free, too.

697
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,520
Well, we're always recommending jobs

698
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,080
that fit our members well.

699
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,120
Read it carefully and if you don't want it,

700
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,880
then you don't have to fill it out.

701
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,560
Can someone with bad credit??join too?

702
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,360
Oh, you two are??delinquent with debt?

703
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,320
Both of you?

704
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,240
Huh? Ah??yes??

705
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,120
If you're in that situation, you should work harder.

706
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,120
There's someone else in charge of that department.

707
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,480
Here.

708
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,920
Excuse me for a moment.

709
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,080
Please wait and have these.

710
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,200
What the heck?

711
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,960
At this rate, we might really get jobs.

712
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,320
Looks like we got the wrong place.

713
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,680
Let's take a quick look, leave this place,

714
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,520
and consult with Prosecutor Kang and Detective Eun.

715
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,880
What is this?

716
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,080
- Wow, those bastards. - What is it?

717
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,600
That bastard added something to our drinks.

718
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,800
Sleeping pills?

719
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,840
Maybe.

720
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,880
It is that gang Lieutenant Nam told me about.

721
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,560
It wasn't disintegrated. It became more organized and systematic.

722
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,760
Let's get out of here now.

723
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,280
(VIP Consulting Room)

724
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,960
Where are you two going?

725
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,640
We'll go get our IDs.

726
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,040
Will you come with Prosecutor Kang

727
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
and Detective Eun next time?

728
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,400
Let's take a quick look, leave this place,

729
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,240
and consult with Prosecutor Kang and Detective Eun.

730
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,320
Damn it, we can't leave here quietly anymore.

731
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,240
What should we do?

732
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,760
Who the heck are you guys?

733
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,880
Can you fight?

734
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,200
You know I'm always number one in everything, right?

735
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,880
I was the top graduating student at the police academy, too.

736
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,320
You need to fight well.

737
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,360
If not, I might have to touch you

738
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,960
in order to save you.

739
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,360
Whatever.

740
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,080
I don't want to stop you that much anymore.

741
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,000
What?

742
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,520
What do you mean?

743
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,080
Alright, alright.

744
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,880
You two look so cute together,

745
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,080
but can you please focus on us right now?

746
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,480
There are too many of us for you to ignore.

747
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,400
Hey.

748
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,080
Something really important came up all of a sudden.

749
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,160
Well, now that we're here,

750
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
if you know Kim Gap-yong, raise your hand.

751
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,760
Anyone that does will be my only target.

752
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,520
Katalk.

753
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,960
Come on, I said it's okay now.

754
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,000
It's an instinct. An instinct.

755
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,120
Damn it.

756
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,280
You bastard.

757
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Yoon Jae-in, let's go.

758
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,960
Move out!

759
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,640
Scram!

760
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,760
Hurry.

761
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,120
Hey, what the heck?

762
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,400
Get them all!

763
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,160
Don't let a single one go.

764
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,040
Detective Lee, don't let a single one go.

765
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,240
What is going on?

766
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
The police?

767
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,760
How did she find out about this place?

768
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,080
Did you contact her?

769
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,320
Why would I?

770
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,480
Damn it.

771
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,720
If she finds out that we came here alone, we're doomed.

772
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,320
- Let's get out of here. - Okay.

773
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,920
Hey, what the heck?

774
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,400
I'm a cop.

775
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,160
Why am I running away from the cops?

776
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,120
Would you please let go first?

777
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Ah.

778
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,120
Let's see how this place is cleared before we go.

779
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,120
Sure.

780
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,360
If they find out that we came here all by ourselves,

781
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,720
then the points I earned at the autopsy room will be gone.

782
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,160
46.

783
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,320
47.

784
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,880
What on earth did I do?

785
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,560
You jumped into a pit of fire, unarmed.

786
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,120
My biggest fear came true in the end.

787
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,760
- What is it? - Being dumbed down

788
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,600
to your level while trying to improve your power.

789
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,800
You're the one who asked me to come here.

790
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
I know.

791
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,000
Ever since I met you again,

792
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,960
I became impetuous.

793
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,160
Actually, I??

794
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,160
I confessed to you.

795
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,720
Confess?

796
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,760
I said that I will never run away again

797
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,800
if I ever meet you again,

798
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,760
as I left that rooftop.

799
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
Lee Ahn.

800
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,120
By any chance,

801
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,480
if you do psychometry on me right here, right now,

802
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,800
then I wanted to tell you.

803
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,200
That your words about helping me

804
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,720
gave me strength, even for a moment.

805
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,040
Make your power great and awesome!

806
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,480
If you do, when I'm confident,

807
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,600
I will go look for you.

808
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,520
I heard that confession already.

809
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,080
- Really? - I told you.

810
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,080
My psychometry works well when I'm with you, for some reason.

811
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,880
That's such a mystery.

812
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,520
I am a mystery myself.

813
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,120
You didn't come to find me,

814
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,240
but we met by coincidence.

815
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,040
I was waiting, thinking you might run away again if I'm pushy.

816
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,720
Well, I can't really say that I made my power great and awesome.

817
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
That's true.

818
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,320
But??

819
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,000
I've decided to do it for sure.

820
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,280
So you want to do it today?

821
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,320
Right now? Right here?

822
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,440
Yes, before I change my mind again.

823
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,560
Let's do the practice on me, today.

824
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,360
Uh??no.

825
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,200
Was this the most sensitive part?

826
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,280
Hey, what are you doing?

827
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,040
This is totally awkward, you know.

828
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
You're wrong.

829
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,880
That's not the part.

830
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
I told you.

831
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,080
The most sensitive part is

832
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
right here.

833
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,120
(He is Psychometric)

834
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,120
- Where? - Text the address to me.

835
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,640
That's where today's class will be.

836
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,040
My daughter, your shoelace is untied again.

837
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,000
Dad??

838
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm going there because I have someone to beat to near-death.

839
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,880
Let's do the practice on me.

840
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,480
They don't know about it yet, right?

841
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,400
She acted so haughtily, but she's a pervert.

842
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,560
Hi. Call me if you need my help.

843
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,760
Don't forget about me telling you that you will be in danger.

844
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,400
I want to start with this woman.

845
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,840
If someone precious to Kang Sung-mo

846
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,480
is in danger, then it isn't me.

847
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,640
Be careful, going back.

848
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,080
Hey, the murderer is dead. What do you need to hide?

849
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,280
We got caught.
