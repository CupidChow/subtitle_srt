(He is Psychometric)

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
You told me you wouldn't kill them if I came to see you.

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,760
I just did what Kang Sung-mo did.

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,960
Like my son.

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,720
If your effort made him human,

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,800
then I should've become human as well.

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,120
What are you trying to say?

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,840
The murder at Yeongseong Apartments.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm telling you that I didn't do it.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
An emotionless child

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,160
like me

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
would've been able to do it, don't you think?

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
That's a lie.

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,800
That can't be.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,920
Kang Geun-taek lied, right?

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Right?

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,840
Tell me that Sung-mo didn't do it! Tell me!

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Did Sung-mo tell you about my power, too?

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,680
I told you.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,600
I already figured out

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
all the places you could hide.

30

I told you that man did all of it.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
So he can take me.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Then why was Sung-mo at Hanmin Nursing hospital?

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,800
That never happened, and it never could've happened.

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,480
I haven't seen Sung-mo! Not even once!

35
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
Then how did you know about Kang Geun-taek

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,400
and Sae Ki Dong Station Basement Floor 3?

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,160
You didn't know about it before, how do you know now?

Lee Ahn.

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Stop it.

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,920
Take her away.

41

Do you think this place is for you to let your anger out?

44

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
trick you sometimes.

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
To be more favorable to you.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,880
Even if it's painful,

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,920
if you don't look into them straight on,

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,800
the same mistake will be repeated again.

50
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,520

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
telling the truth is the only way to

52
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,640
save you and Prosecutor Kang.

53
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Sung-mo couldn't have done that.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,240

- Come here, you're so dead. - Wait??Wait.

70
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,920
Why can't I solve it on my own?

71
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
When I have this!

72
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,320
Wow, okay, okay.

73
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,640
Everyone knows that you like Sung-mo.

74
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,280
Ugh, this is embarrassing.

Thank you so much, Ji-soo.

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,400
- Don't come this way. - Please, drop the knife!

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,120
No!

84
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,160
Ji-soo, wake up!

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,560
We found your mother.

86
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
So let's go back.

87
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,360
Please??

88
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,440

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,920

93
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
What's all this?

94
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,440
We found them at Sae Ki Dong while looking for Kang Geun-taek.

95
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,680
Are the results from NFS out?

96
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,760
They are out, yes, but??

97
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
Please take a look.

98
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,160
They all belong to Kang Geun-taek.

99
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,760
This jerk has been going around all the ghost stations, huh?

100
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,280
I thought so in the beginning, too.

101
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,880
But Ahn said that Prosecutor Kang

102
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,120
left these objects.

103
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Prosecutor Kang?

104
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,800
How did that brat find that out?

105
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
What did NFS say?

106
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,800
Did they find Prosecutor Kang's fingerprints or something?

107
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,720
These chains are the evidence for the confinement in Gangnyeong

108
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,880
and the murder of Kim Gap-yong.

109
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,080
And this knife is the evidence for Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

110
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,040
I checked with evidence management

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
and they said Prosecutor Kang took them a long time ago.

112
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,280
All of this evidence is related to the cases?

113
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,480
Are we to actually solve all these cases properly now?

114
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
We'll have a meeting with everyone tomorrow morning. Officer Yoon,

115
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,040
prepare the meeting.

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,880
- Yes, sir. - I will prepare the meeting.

117
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,600
I have understood enough about this case as well.

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,080
No, understanding it "enough" isn't good enough.

119
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
We need to do it perfectly.

120
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
What about Ahn?

121
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,080
Can Ahn join the meeting, too?

122
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,600
If he's going to get upset and go off like that,

123
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,920
I don't need him, even if he sees more than memories.

124
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,320
- Memories? - Bring him when

125
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,600
you can calm him down.

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
What memories??

127
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,960
What's his deal anyway?

128
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Lee Ahn.

129
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Just where did he go to?

130
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,200
The things found in the bag from Sae Ki Dong Station are

131
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,080
pieces of evidence from the confinement case,

132
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,520
the Hanmin case, and the Kim Gap-yong case?

133
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes.

134
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,800
It feels like Prosecutor Kang

135
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,440
keeps dragging us into past cases.

136
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,360
By the way, why were you so upset

137
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,880
at Kang Eun-joo earlier?

138
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,240
When Kang Geun-taek met Kang Eun-joo at Hanmin

139
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,400
Nursing Hospital, he told her about Yeongseong Apt.

140
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
What?

141
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,160
He said that he did prepare the fake body of Kang Eun-joo

142
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,880
and thought about setting the place on fire,

143
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
but he didn't do it, and the one who did it

144
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
was Sung-mo.

145
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sure it's not true.

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Prosecutor Kang wouldn't do such a thing.

147
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,040
Since Kang Eun-joo heard that from Kang Geun-taek,

148
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,320
it seems that she keeps lying for Sung-mo's sake.

149
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,800
Regardless of whether it's true or not.

150
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
We need to find the evidence to prove that Kang Eun-joo has been

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,120
meeting Prosecutor Kang while she changed her identity to

152
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Park Soo-young, Kang Hee-sook, and Kim Song-hee.

153
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,520
Why do you even need evidence? I saw everything.

154
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,320
The memories you saw won't hold up in a court of law.

155
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,720
If we want to utilize it in the investigation

156
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
and make Kang Eun-joo speak, we have to find something concrete.

157
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,400
Even though my power improved, it's still not helpful, damn it.

158
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,000
So, is that why you've been here all alone?

159
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
I went to the autopsy room.

160
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,960
Ji-soo always had been warm,

161
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,880
but she was so cold, and it was terrifying.

162
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,880
I wish that she could've left with good memories only.

163
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
Did she remember the murder scene, too?

164
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Kang Geun-taek did kill Ji-soo.

165
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,880
And even though Ji-soo asked Sung-mo to come back,

166
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,880
and even though those were her last words, Sung-mo disappeared.

167
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,480
I keep having bad thoughts. This seems like a bad omen.

168
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Ahn, let's forget about what Kang Geun-taek

169
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,360
said to Kang Eun-joo at Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

170
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,000
Perhaps he lied to her, so he can take her.

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,160
I want to believe that too,

172
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,320
but everything I saw

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,760
makes me doubt Sung-mo.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Lee Ahn.

175
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,160
These are the small clues you saw.

176
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,200
Which word do you think you can make with these?

177
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,920
"Deot." (=Trap)

178
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Yes.

179
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,920
This is obviously "trap".

180
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Something that can tie you up.

181
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
But what if I

182
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
do this?

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
It becomes "doht." (=Sail)

184
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,640
That makes a boat move forward.

185
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,960
But this can also turn into

186
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,480
"dat (=anchor)," which stops the boat.

187
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,080
Trap,

188
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
sail, and??

189
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
anchor.

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
We have to get to the end to see

191
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,720
what kind of word will be completed,

192
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
so if you give up now,

193
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
we can't complete any words.

194
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Wait.

195
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,320
The case materials Sung-mo left in the room.

196
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
There was one more case, besides the panhandling case.

197
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
(Murders of the Homeless)

198
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,000
So he left the materials on the murder of the homeless

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,760
on purpose as well?

200
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,160
Like the case materials for the panhandling case?

201
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
Didn't you see anything weird from here?

202
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,800
I just assumed that Kang Geun-taek fabricated his identity

203
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,040
by using the homeless.

204
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Fabricating identity??fabricating identity.

205
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
Wait.

206
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,960
Wasn't this case involved with Dragon Head Hunting?

207
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,360
You mean the one Lieutenant Nam swept?

208
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,880
The Dragon Employment Agency case?

209
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Yes, I was in charge of that case.

210
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,040
It was a gang that fabricated identities by using the homeless,

211
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,920
the vagrants, and even resorting to murder,

212
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,760
but Kim Gap-yong was released due to lack of evidence.

213
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,960
The police and the prosecution covered them, so I couldn't win.

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,800
If Prosecutor Kang was in charge of this case,

215
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,360
that means he knew of Kim Gap-yong, who helped

216
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,320
Kang Eun-joo fabricate her identity.

217
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,400
If Sung-mo knew that Kang Eun-joo was alive, for a long time,

218
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,480
I'm sure Kim Gap-yong was the person he needed most.

219
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,120
But Prosecutor Kang

220
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
acted like he knew nothing about Kim Gap-yong.

221
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,920
Things are not going pretty.

222
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
I'm sorry,

223
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
but that person doesn't want any more trouble.

224
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,640
I can kill you right here,

225
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,800
but without you,

226
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,040
I'll lose my VIP client.

227
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
Lieutenant Nam.

228
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,640
Please allow me to meet Kang Eun-joo once more.

229
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,760
What?

230
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,360
I swear I won't yell at her and force her to say things.

231
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,080
If Sung-mo instigated the murders of Park Soo-young

232
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,800
and Kang Hee-sook and the Yeongseong Apt. case too,

233
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,720
then I'm sure Kang Eun-joo is confused now, like me.

234
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
The one who can understand Kang Eun-joo the best

235
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
at this moment, is me.

236
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,400
It has been revealed that the murder of a detective at

237
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,080
a ghost station is connected to the murders at Yeongseong Apt.

238
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,400
and Hanmin Nursing Hospital, shocking many.

239
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,440
It is already day 3 of the case,

240
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,680
but the suspect Kang Geun-taek is still nowhere to be found.

241
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,680
The police put Kang on the wanted list

242
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,160
and formed an exclusive team to search for him,

243
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
but it is reported that the investigation isn't progressing.

244
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,640
What is this place?

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Do you know the first thing I learned

246
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,000
after I got out of the basement?

247
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
I've learned that relationships between people

248
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,480
aren't as simple as they were in the tales

249
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,160
my mother read to me.

250
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,760
Relationships.

251
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,880
Out of all those relationships, if someone wants something

252
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,080
they pay the price to get what they want.

253
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,160
What are you trying to say?

254
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,120
The fact that you're an undocumented criminal

255
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,480
was a hole in the administration of the country.

256
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,320
So the investigators

257
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,800
quietly sealed that hole.

258
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,720
Our wounds weren't

259
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,000
at the top of their priority list.

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,080
Are you saying that it wouldn't have come this far

261
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,160
if I got caught at that time?

262
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,960
I became a prosecutor

263
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
to protect Mother and find you,

264
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,240
I've been thinking about it over and over again.

265
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,000
About whether I should let you get punished by the system,

266
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,400
or if I should have my hands covered in blood.

267
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,840
Are you saying that you'll pay me back in kind?

268
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,680
Exactly how you and Eun-joo suffered?

269
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,720
Doing to you what you did to us would be meaningless revenge.

270
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,120
It'll only be true revenge if you suffer more than we did.

271
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,080
The wound will soon start to throb and fester.

272
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,760
And then it'll slowly rot.

273
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,800
Oh, but you see,

274
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,160
I still don't really know what pain is.

275
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,520
Don't worry.

276
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,720
I will make sure that you feel it.

277
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,800
Kang Geun-taek, the suspect who confined

278
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,560
Kang Eun-joo and Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo for nine years

279
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,960
is assumed to have been held captive by a panhandling gang

280
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,040
when he was young, and as a result, he remained undocumented,

281
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,000
with no confirmable name.

282
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,520
In 1996, at the time of her escape, Kang Eun-joo said that

283
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
Kang Geun-taek had alexithymia, difficulty in expressing emotions,

284
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,080
and he locked her up because he was obsessed with her,

285
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,160
whom he felt emotions for the first time.

286
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,680
She also claims that he is behind the Yeongseong case

287
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,840
and the Hanmin case as well, because of that motive.

288
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,320
We'll have a general meeting tomorrow morning.

289
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,880
I'll leave only the minimum amount of officers on duty,

290
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,040
so go meet her during that time.

291
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,600
Kang Geun-taek has been following around Kang Sung-mo, his son,

292
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,160
in order to find Kang Eun-joo, who had disappeared.

293
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
He harmed and kidnapped those around Kang Sung-mo

294
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,080
in order to pressure him,

295
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,720
which led to the murder of Detective Eun Ji-soo.

296
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,760
As of right now, all of the circumstantial evidence

297
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,080
are pointing to the suspect, Kang Geun-taek, but??

298
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,440
But?

299
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,480
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo, Kang Eun-joo's son,

300
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
cannot be left off the suspect list.

301
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,560
What do you mean?

302
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,840
Why is Prosecutor Kang a suspect?

303
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,080
Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo knew that Kang Eun-joo was alive.

304
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,560
And there are circumstances that show he was involved with

305
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,040
Kim Gap-yong, who was fabricating Kang Eun-joo's identity.

306
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,440
So, what's the direction of the investigation?

307
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Currently, Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo is tracking down Kang Geun-taek,

308
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,200
and his final goal is murder.

309
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,120
I think it'd be faster to track down Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo

310
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,960
rather than Kang Geun-taek.

311
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,160
Ugh, what is she talking about?

312
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,120
Didn't Prosecutor Kang

313
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
become a prosecutor to catch Kang Geun-taek?

314
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,440
So he should just catch him and lock him up.

315
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
Why would he kill him?

316
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
Catching him and locking him up would've ended it,

317
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
but who lost him, again?

318
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,480
Ugh, how can I go against someone who was able to

319
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,080
suddenly uncuff himself and choke me?

320
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
You think you could've done better?

321
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,120
That's why Prosecutor Kang doesn't trust

322
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,120
the law, the police, or justice.

323
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,760
The confinement case remained as a cold case,

324
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,080
and the body that wasn't the real Kang Eun-joo

325
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,400
was there during the fire at Yeongseong Apartments,

326
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
but those truths were never uncovered.

327
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,720
No, rather,

328
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,640
there was no desire to uncover those truths.

329
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,880
I'm not sure where I should start??

330
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,000
I always go straight whenever I see a path,

331
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,680
and I don't know how to go around.

332
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,320
I'll be honest and tell you that I'm here to persuade you.

333
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,760
My head was about to explode because I couldn't understand,

334
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,040
but I've decided not to come to any conclusion

335
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
until I meet Sung-mo and hear it from him directly.

336
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,120
Whatever Sung-mo did

337
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,400
was all for me.

338
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,600
Sung-mo didn't do anything wrong.

339
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,120
If so,

340
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,040
isn't it the time for you to do

341
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,400
something for Sung-mo, Ms. Kang Eun-joo?

342
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,680
I saw you telling him not to kill that man

343
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
in the basement.

344
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,040
I, too, want to stop Sung-mo from committing murder.

345
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
Forgiveness, understanding, or resentment.

346
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,080
I've decided to think about all that later.

347
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Sung-mo??

348
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,600
Sung-mo did know that you were alive, right?

349
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,120
So,

350
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
this is all because the police did a crappy job, huh?

351
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,480
You're really straightforward to your senior officers.

352
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,160
She's at that age, where her passion is at its peak.

353
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,120
So don't pay her any attention.

354
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,720
Pay attention and feel it in your bones.

355
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,880
Haven't you two as cops, ever put the puzzle pieces

356
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,720
of a case together, the way you want, just to be done with it?

357
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Haven't you ever turned a case into a cold case by giving up?

358
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,120
If you have never, raise your hand.

359
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm not positive I can either.

360
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,920
I'm sure you've done it before, you're just hiding it.

361
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,080
Don't get caught and be embarrassed,

362
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
just do it right this time. Go.

363
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,000
Officer Yoon, go to Lee Ahn

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,440
and see if he has heard anything from Kang Eun-joo.

365
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes, sir.

366
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,840
The memories you saw won't hold up in a court of law.

367
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,480
If we want to utilize it in the investigation

368
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,160
and make Kang Eun-joo speak,

369
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,920
we have to find something concrete.

370
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,280
Something concrete??

371
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,160
We have to find proof, huh?

372
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,720
My plan at that time was to never return to Korea.

373
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,360
His plan was to never return to Korea?

374
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,520
Did Kang Eun-joo say anything?

375
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,040
Don't beat yourself up.

376
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,680
This is just the beginning.

377
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,480
Jae-in.

378
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,920
Can we find out Kang Eun-joo's entry and departure record

379
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
when she was Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook?

380
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,520
Yes, if we find the certificate of entry and departure??

381
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
I'll call you.

382
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
(Republic of Korea Passport)

383
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Here it is.

384
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I found it.

385
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,720
When Kang Eun-joo lived with the identity of Park Soo-young,

386
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,320
she was in Canada from January 2009

387
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,640
to December 2013.

388
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,000
I was right.

389
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,720
Sung-mo went to Canada as an exchange student at that time.

390
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,560
He returned in 2010, but he'd been going

391
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,000
to Canada a lot of times even after that.

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
And the last date of entry was

393
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,880
December 1, 2013.

394
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,000
For Kang Eun-joo, it was December 2.

395
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
They entered Korea, one day apart from each other.

396
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,000
She would've been safe if she stayed there.

397
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,480
Why did she return all of a sudden?

398
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Lieutenant Nam.

399
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,680
Did you investigate Kim Gap-yong's gang for

400
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,800
the murders of the homeless in the winter of 2013?

401
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,880
That's right. Winter of 2013.

402
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,480
It seems like she returned out of the fear that her identity

403
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
might be revealed, as the police investigated the gang.

404
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,680
And she changed her identity again to Kang Hee-sook.

405
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,200
And Kim Gap-yong killed the real Park Soo-young

406
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,880
and Kang Hee-sook, to tie up loose ends?

407
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,120
"That person" mentioned by Kim Gap-yong??

408
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,200
was Sung-mo.

409
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,600
I saw you telling him not to kill that man

410
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
in the basement.

411
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,160
I, too, want to stop Sung-mo from committing murder.

412
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Isn't it the time for you to do

413
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,120
something for Sung-mo, Ms. Kang Eun-joo?

414
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm sure you all remember the case of a detective

415
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,560
being murdered at a ghost station.

416
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,120
The murder of the detective at the ghost station is connected to

417
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,680
not only the arson cases at Yeongseong and Hanmin

418
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,120
but also the confinement case in Gangnyeong, Gangwon-do, 1996??

419
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,480
I mean, why is there something new every day?

420
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,960
A confinement case?

421
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,440
So that's related to

422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,640
Yeongseong Apartments, right?

423
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,560
If so??Is Jae-in investigating all of those cases?

424
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,320
The Yeongseong Apartments case, too?

425
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,680
She is,

426
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,560
but the Yeongseong Apartments case was a long time ago.

427
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,720
And that confinement case or whatever

428
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,480
happened more than 20 years ago.

429
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm afraid she might just suffer even more.

430
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,320
I should ask my dad once more.

431
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,040
And check if it really was Jae-in's dad

432
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
who put the security guard uniform on me.

433
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,560
You??You don't talk to your dad anymore.

434
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,840
But if I don't take action when there's a re-investigation,

435
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,240
it might be covered up again.

436
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,000
Really? Could you do that for us?

437
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
Okay, here's your receipt.

438
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,000
And uh, here??

439
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Yes, uh??You've seen the news, right?

440
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,840
My friend is investigating this case.

441
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,800
If you see anyone like this,

442
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,240
please call the police right away.

443
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,440
Thank you.

444
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,040
Ugh, aren't you going a bit overboard?

445
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,880
Hey, how is this going overboard?

446
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
If you know what a precious "sister" the murdered detective

447
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
was to my friend, you wouldn't say that.

448
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
You see, this man

449
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,120
had been following one woman for his entire life,

450
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,880
and killed those around her, and set buildings on fire.

451
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,160
Ugh, that's ridiculous.

452
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,000
How can anyone do that for love?

453
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,400
If the one you love thinks of you as sick and terrible,

454
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,600
then the right thing to do is to turn around and walk away.

455
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
That's the right thing to do.

456
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,000
Let's just think of the facts.

457
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
The facts I saw.

458
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,440
Sung-mo knew that Kang Eun-joo was alive

459
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,160
at the time of the fire at Yeongseong Apartments,

460
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,840
but made her live as a dead person.

461
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Kim Gap-yong changed Kang Eun-joo's identity,

462
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,200
going so far as to killing Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook.

463
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,120
That person doesn't want any more trouble.

464
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,000
And Sung-mo rescued Kang Eun-joo from Hanmin Nursing Hospital.

465
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,000
And the next thing is??

466
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,080
Damn it??

467
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,040
(Passport)

468
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
Yes, this can be the evidence

469
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,280
that shows Prosecutor Kang knew that Kang Eun-joo was alive.

470
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,880
How about we use a lie detector?

471
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,160
If it's proven that Kang Eun-joo is lying,

472
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,240
we can extend her period of detention, can't we?

473
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,880
The period of investigation under detention is going to end

474
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,320
and she's a flight risk.

475
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,000
Furthermore, Kang Geun-taek hasn't been arrested,

476
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,600
so it'd be more dangerous if she gets freed.

477
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,720
A lie detector test barely holds up in court.

478
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,120
And there's no point in gathering new information,

479
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,760
while we already know that

480
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,360
Kang Eun-joo is lying.

481
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,080
Then can we keep her with her current charges?

482
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Forgery of official documents, use of said documents,

483
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,920
and obstruction of justice. Can we apply for a warrant with that?

484
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,120
We can try, but I'm not sure about the results.

485
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,520
A woman who was locked up by a man for 9 years is alive.

486
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,960
And that bastard has not been caught yet.

487
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,360
And with the national petition asking for the release

488
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,640
of Kang Eun-joo and the arrest of incompetent cops,

489
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,040
the public sentiment is pretty bad right now.

490
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,480
Found it.

491
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,640
I found the footage of Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo

492
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,480
coming out of the hospital where Detective Eun was at.

493
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,280
The time he left the hospital was 5:45.

494
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,160
There's footage of him going to the opposite side of the hospital.

495
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,600
Search thoroughly along the timeline.

496
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,840
This isn't an alleyway near Seoheun Police Station.

497
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,480
How can he avoid CCTVs in town, when he's not a ghost?

498
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,600
Focus, and find him. Hurry.

499
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,360
Ah, I found Prosecutor Kang.

500
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,320
6:10. He's going toward Bangji 3-ro.

501
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,000
Hello, this is the police. Are you the owner of the car 3344?

502
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,560
You parked at Bangji 3-ro three days ago, right?

503
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
We'd like to check your black box.

504
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,600
I found him. 7:20, in front of HQ Convenience Store. 4 o'clock.

505
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,920
Check Kang Kook 3-dong A3, A8, and H.

506
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,240
I found him going into Seongwoon Motel, at 8:35.

507
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,040
- What time did he leave? - 10 minutes after.

508
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
All of you, keep tracking down Kang Sung-mo's whereabouts

509
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,040
after he left Seongwoon Motel.

510
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,560
- Alright, let's go, Officer Yoon. - Yes, sir.

511
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,480
Ahn, we found the traces of Prosecutor Kang.

512
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,600
Where?

513
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,480
The owner said Prosecutor Kang stayed here for three days.

514
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
It's been cleaned already.

515
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,240
This is why I hate clean places.

516
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,160
I'll go check where they took the trash out.

517
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,120
You go see if there are any potential clues here.

518
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
Here?

519
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,320
If he came here in the middle of everything,

520
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,080
that means there was something he needed from this place.

521
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,960
Okay.

522
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,680
Can he read memories from objects, too? Not just from people?

523
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,080
- Yes. - Wow, he's incredible.

524
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,720
The trash?

525
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,560
I left it in front of the door.

526
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm sure the garbage truck took it already.

527
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,960
There it is. Officer Yoon!

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,080
What is this?

534
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,640
It looks like a pill bottle.

535
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,760
Looks like these pills were in here.

00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440

Okay, hold on.

547
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,440
Jungyi-dong Apartments are here.

548
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,200
And Uinam Villa is around here??

549
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,920
Oh, Uinam Villa.

550
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,560
I found Uinam Traditional Market and Koo Yang National Hospital.

551
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,880
Wait.

552
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,800
Uinam Traditional Market was on fire 2 months ago, and it's empty.

553
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,720
Jungyi-dong Apartments are under redevelopment as well.

554
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,240
That means all of these places

555
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,080
don't see a lot of people.

556
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,560
I patrol this area all the time, so I know the area well.

557
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,520
Detective Kim, look into Koo Yang Natl. Hospital and Uinal Villa.

558
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
Yes, sir.

559
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,960
Are these places all close to Kang Kook Station?

560
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
Yes, that's right.

561
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,640
Looks like Sung-mo thought that Kang Geun-taek was hiding

562
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,160
in one of these places.

563
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,040
Was it in case he lost Kang Geun-taek at Kang Kook St.?

564
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,360
Take a photo of the map and send it to me,

565
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,960
and split up to search the areas.

566
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Okay, where should we go to?

567
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,760
It's been a while, let's use our hunches.

568
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,600
We should go check the place closest to Kang Kook Station??

569
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,040
No, we should check Koo Yang National Hospital.

570
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,120
Right? You had a hunch about that place too, right?

571
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,840
Because Kang Geun-taek was shot and wounded.

572
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,240
Yes, a restroom still has remains of poo, even if it's cleaned.

573
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
So I'm sure he went to that hospital

574
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,880
to find some medicine he can use.

575
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I think I gave Eun-joo and you

576
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,000
the medicine you needed, at least.

577
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
Yes, you did.

578
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,120
I didn't even know what pain was,

579
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,040
but Mother had to beg for medicine

580
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
whenever something seemed wrong with my health,

581
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040
and had to do what you wanted her to do as the price.

582
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,520
I protected you and Eun-joo

583
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
from the dangerous world,

584
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,400
and this is how you repay me?

585
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,120
What protected Mother

586
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,800
was the hope that she could, one day, escape.

587
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,080
But when she did come out,

588
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,120
she lost that last bit of hope as well.

589
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,480
She blamed herself, even though it wasn't her fault.

590
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,440
'Why did so many people have to die because of me?'

591
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,360
We later learned that Mother, the victim, bore all the pain

592
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,240
because the assailant

593
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,000
wasn't punished.

594
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,320
Why don't you let Eun-joo

595
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,120
see my body rot instead?

596
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,880
If this is how it's going to end for me,

597
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,680
I want to see Eun-joo one last time,

598
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,640
even with a rotting body.

Sung-mo is here, too.

Yes, I see.

It seems that Sung-mo found Kang Geun-taek and took him away.

You're doing quite well.

633
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm sure Detective Eun thinks so as well.

634
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,920
So you haven't found traces of Prosecutor Kang yet, right?

Kang Sung-mo's fingerprints were found from the container.

And this medicine in fluvoxamine,

641
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,240
and it's a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

642
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,120
In other words, it's a medicine for impulse control disorders

643
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,000
and intermittent explosive disorder.

644
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,560
You mean Sung-mo's been taking medication

645
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,920
for controlling his anger, not for headaches?

646
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,280
Does that mean Sung-mo no longer

647
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,960
suffers from alexithymia?

648
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,680
I don't think this is something to be happy about.

If Prosecutor Kang threw away this medicine,

650
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,720
it means that he doesn't want to

651
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,160
control his anger anymore.

652
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,000
Do you think I'll feel pain if you continue doing this?

653
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,440
It's better than doing nothing.

654
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,920
But you see,

655
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,920
it seems that brat who thinks of you as his savior

656
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,000
started to doubt you.

657
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,120
When doubt grows, it'll turn into conviction,

658
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,960
and conviction will soon turn into anger.

659
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,040
He will be desperate to find you and me.

660
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,400
Though I'm not sure you'll be able to survive until then.

661
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,280
It's not easy to investigate.

662
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,400
The superiors are pressuring us.

663
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,480
Because of the fact that the suspect Kang Geun-taek

664
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
is an undocumented individual,

665
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,880
Ministry of the Interior and Safety is in total chaos,

666
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,640
and the press is starting to whisper about

667
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,800
the poor construction of Yeongseong Apartments.

668
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,480
Soon the special prosecution team targeting YSS Construction

669
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,000
will be formed.

670
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Dae-nam.

671
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,560
When someone else takes my place, this investigation will be over.

672
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,080
I will have my hands cuffed after this case is closed,

673
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,840
so until that happens, keep pushing.

674
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,120
I'll try my best too.

675
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,240
I know it sounds like an excuse,

676
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,000
but at first, I really thought Yoon Tae-ha was the culprit.

677
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,920
I was positive.

678
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,040
To the stairs!

679
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,560
Take the stairs!

680
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,200
Lower your bodies!

681
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,360
Lower your bodies as much as you can!

682
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,720
- Oh, Mr. Kim, this way! - One of the residents

683
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,160
showed me a bloodstained security guard uniform,

684
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,080
saying that Yoon Tae-ha gave it to him so he can cover his mouth.

685
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Mister. You're fired as of today!

686
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,720
There was testimony about him fighting Women's Society, too.

687
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,240
Everything was going smoothly.

688
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,360
Mr. Eun Byung-ho.

689
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,240
I'm from YSS Construction.

690
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,480
They said that the money was just pure incentive

691
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,320
to wrap up the case quickly.

692
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
It wasn't much either, so I didn't think it was dirty money.

693
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,200
Because that investigation had nothing to be ashamed of.

694
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,240
But??

695
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,000
Did you look for the person I told you to look for?

696
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,160
I told you, there was no such person.

697
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,120
I saw him with my own eyes.

698
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,960
He was looking in the direction of our house,

699
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,400
across from the apartment building that day.

700
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,200
Kang Sung-mo came to see me a few times,

701
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,600
saying that the culprit is someone else.

702
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,920
I heard about the confinement case in Gangnyeong as well.

703
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,600
I'm sure you couldn't re-investigate.

704
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,800
Even the assemblypeople who turned a blind eye on

705
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,040
YSS Construction's poor construction

706
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,400
were busy bribing and pampering me, shaking out of fear

707
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,600
that I might re-investigate the case.

708
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,080
(Detective Eun Ji-soo's watch)

709
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,200
Do you know what came to my mind when I heard that the police

710
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,000
lost the bastard who killed Ji-soo?

711
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,160
There's no way for arms and legs to function

712
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,720
when the head is rotten.

713
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,160
(Evidence in the murder of Kim Gap-yong??

714
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
So that's it.

715
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,520
My psychometry notebook.

716
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
You knew about it?

717
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Yes.

718
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,280
Why did Prosecutor Kang??

719
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,800
give this to me?

720
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,120
If I look at it as the "trap" you mentioned,

721
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,080
perhaps he wanted to tame me and use me in investigations.

722
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,240
What if you think of it as the "sail?"

723
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,320
Because he was sorry?

724
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Because he was sorry?

725
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,000
In the end, the fire happened because of his mother.

726
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
And because of that, you and I

727
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,960
became victims.

728
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Then I'd like to

729
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,160
think of it as this.

730
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,920
(Anchor)

731
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,040
- Anchor? - That Prosecutor Kang??

732
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,440
wants us to stop him.

733
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,320
Ugh, let me take one photo, please. Prosecutor Kang Sung-mo.

734
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,000
If not, we'll go for a third round.

735
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,680
You've never taken these before, huh?

736
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm sure Prosecutor Kang has never taken these before.

737
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,240
I don't take photos like this.

738
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,760
Hey, Cyborg.

739
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,120
Smile.

740
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,200
I said smile. Like this.

741
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Uh??

742
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,080
Yeah, you know how to smile.

743
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,000
Smile!

744
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,440
One, two, three!

745
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,840
Hey, Kang Sung-mo.

746
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,680
Why do you have so many secrets?

747
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,080
You've been thinking and worrying all by yourself for two years.

748
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,880
I'm telling you, I will help you.

749
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,480
Am I that unhelpful to you?

750
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,360
What a disadvantageous relationship we have.

751
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,560
I clearly show my thoughts,

752
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,840
and you show nothing, unless you say it.

753
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,800
It seems that you've become more positive,

754
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,720
but I don't know why I'm still anxious.

755
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,360
You did change for sure.

756
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,360
I wanted to make you change.

757
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,360
Killing that bastard

758
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,160
won't heal your wound.

759
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,560
It'll only become a bigger wound.

760
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,040
So

761
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
please??

762
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,120
Come back with me.

763
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,320
Kang Sung-mo.

764
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,120
I'm sorry I came late.

765
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,200
Like you said,

766
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm going to go back now.

767
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,080
(Seoul Seoheun Main Police Station)

768
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,080
How does this make sense?

769
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,440
The investigation isn't over,

770
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,240
and Kang Eun-joo is still lying??

771
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,560
What's going on?

772
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,480
Then please let her stay until the end of her detention.

773
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,120
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

774
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
Prosecutor!

775
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,120
The prosecution called us and told us to release Kang Eun-joo.

776
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,720
No way.

777
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,120
Kang Eun-joo doesn't have a clear residence,

778
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,240
and she can be in danger again if she gets out.

779
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,080
Don't worry about that, Officer Yoon.

780
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,800
- Sung-mo. - Prosecutor Kang.

781
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,400
I'll take my mother with me,

782
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,920
so she'll be safe.

783
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,040
But I think I should testify

784
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,640
before I take my mother.

785
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Are you kidding me?

786
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,240
You come out of nowhere and now??What?

787
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,360
You'll testify?

788
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,600
You have a lot of questions to ask me as well.

789
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,560
I'd like Officer Yoon to interrogate me.

790
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,080
Will that be okay, Lieutenant Nam?

791
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,120
Lee Ahn, before anything else,

792
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,680
deliver this to my mother.

793
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,160
What is this?

794
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
My first gift for you.

795
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,320
Promise me that you'll forget about the past

796
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,120
while wearing this.

797
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,120
Don't have nightmares,

798
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,040
and don't be anxious.

799
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,680
And don't feel guilty.

800
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,600
Okay, I will.

801
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,720
I have a gift for you, too.

802
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,040
Sung-mo is here?

803
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,080
Here, you mean?

804
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,080
Yes.

805
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,440
And,

806
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,080
he told me to deliver this to you.

807
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,000
Did Sung-mo catch him?

808
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,080
Did he??

809
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,760
Did he kill him by any chance?

810
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,440
Before we begin the interrogation,

811
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,480
I must say this first.

812
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,480
I'm sorry I couldn't help you when

813
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,120
you were kidnapped by Kang Geun-taek.

814
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,720
Thanks to the map you left,

815
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,080
Ahn found me quickly.

816
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,360
Thank goodness.

817
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,880
I wish I could've been able to tell you about my past earlier,

818
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,080
but as you know, it's not a heartwarming story.

819
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,840
I understand.

820
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,400
I, too, had a hard time about

821
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
talking about my father.

822
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,960
Okay then, where should we begin?

823
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,760
I'll ask you point-blank.

824
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,440
Where's Kang Geun-taek?

825
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,000
Exactly on what grounds are you assuming

826
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,360
that I know where Kang Geun-taek is?

827
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,880
That's??

828
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,040
That's because we saw you anesthetizing

829
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,680
Kang Geun-taek in an abandoned hospital.

830
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,240
I want to know exactly.

831
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,080
Was there a witness?

832
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,160
Or was it from psychometry?

833
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,520
Psychometry?

834
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,320
- What is that? - What is he talking about?

835
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,640
Shut up, all of you!

836
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,640
I'm sure you know that even if you saw the incident with

837
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,680
such an unscientific method,

838
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,360
it won't hold up in court.

839
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,320
Alright.

840
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,000
Then let me start with Yeongseong Apartments.

841
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,040
Fire and murder at Yeongseong Apartments.

842
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,080
Who did it?

843
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,880
The Yeongseong Apartments case, the Hanmin Nursing Hospital case,

844
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,280
and the murder of Kim Gap-yong.

845
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,200
All with the same cause of death.

846
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,400
According to the circumstantial evidence,

847
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,040
I think Kang Geun-taek is behind them.

848
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,240
Are you saying you have no connection?

849
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,040
They do have something to do with me.

850
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,280
It was me who made my mother

851
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,120
run away from Yeongseong Apartments before the fire.

852
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,480
There are a cell phone and money in here.

853
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,680
I'm the only one who knows its number,

854
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,120
so go and hide until I call you.

855
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,120
Sung-mo.

856
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,920
So that means you've known

857
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,160
that Kang Eun-joo was alive from the beginning?

858
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,680
Yes, I have been protecting her.

859
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,240
I got out of unit 701

860
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,720
and went to unit 1501 to meet the police officer who

861
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,240
offered to help me, but it was empty.

862
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,440
And then I found out about the fire.

863
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,840
Lee Ahn, is he telling the truth?

864
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,040
I'm not sure.

865
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,320
I'm not sure if he's telling the truth or not.

866
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,440
I tried to go to my house to check what happened,

867
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,400
but I couldn't, because of the smoke.

868
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,800
And at that moment, I met Yoon Tae-ha

869
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,640
and Lee Ahn in front of the elevator.

870
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,360
I'm sure you and Ahn both know the rest.

871
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,680
Then why??

872
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,960
Why didn't you say that your mother was alive?

873
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,440
Is it because the law never protected you two?

874
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,040
You and I have a lot in common, Officer Yoon.

875
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,080
Both of us cannot trust the law or the police,

876
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,160
but we chose them as our professions.

877
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,680
So we can solve things on our own.

878
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,640
Did you fabricate Kang Eun-joo's identity through Kim Gap-yong?

879
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,040
Yes, but I didn't think that Kim Gap-yong would murder

880
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,200
Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook.

881
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,760
Kang Eun-joo returned from Canada under the name of Park Soo-young

882
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,480
when Kim Gap-yong was being investigated for

883
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,080
murdering the homeless.

884
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,520
And after that,

885
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,400
she changed her identity again to Kang Hee-sook.

886
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,120
And are you saying you didn't know "that person"

887
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,040
mentioned by Kim Gap-yong was you, Prosecutor Kang?

888
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,480
"That person??

889
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,280
I'm telling you again, but psychometry performed by Ahn

890
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,120
cannot be entered as evidence or testimony.

891
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,920
You seem like a different person, Prosecutor Kang.

892
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,240
Why are you acting like this?

893
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:32,040
I'm telling you that there's no evidence that proves

894
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,720
that I instigated the murders of Park Soo-young and Kang Hee-sook.

895
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,360
But the fabrication of identity is a clear fact.

896
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,320
Ah??So you'll accept the charge of identity fabrication?

897
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,680
Since he's a prosecutor, he knows how to get away.

898
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,160
At most, it will be probation.

899
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,600
If he gets extenuated, he won't even get that.

900
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,240
- Did you go to Hanmin Hospital? - Yes.

901
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,640
I rescued my mother, thanks to Kim Gap-yong.

902
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,400
And you turned a blind eye to

903
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,760
Kang Geun-taek committing murder again.

904
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,640
I asked Kim Gap-yong to look after my mother

905
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,680
before she woke up and left.

906
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,360
About what happened at that time

907
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,760
has been investigated based on Kim Gap-yong's testimony.

908
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,000
Kim Gap-yong stated that Song Hee-jeong, a patient,

909
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,200
killed all of the people and committed suicide.

910
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,320
Are you telling me that you believed that ridiculous story?

911
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,480
Everyone believed in it.

912
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:33,440
Even the Police Commissioner and the prosecution at the meeting.

913
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,000
Only one person didn't believe it.

914
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,960
The one who was curious about the truth.

915
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,080
Detective Eun Ji-soo.

916
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,080
She was the only one.

917
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,040
If there's a crime I need to be punished for, I'll gladly accept.

918
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,000
That's the reason why I came back.

919
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,200
Prosecutor Kang.

920
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,680
I must be on my way now.

921
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,040
Having my mother stay behind bars

922
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,120
is too cruel.

923
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,920
What on earth are you thinking?

924
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,160
I just want to reveal the truth.

925
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,000
Then why did you look for Kang Eun-joo

926
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,040
after the Hanmin Nursing Hospital incident?

927
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,120
Was it??all a lie?

928
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,000
Did you show me nothing but lies?

929
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,600
After the incident at Hanmin Nursing Hospital,

930
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,240
Mother disappeared.

931
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,000
I'm going to hear why when I see her now.

932
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,240
Kang Eun-joo didn't meet you

933
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,400
because Kang Geun-taek told her that you were behind

934
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,240
the murder at Yeongseong Apartments.

935
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,440
Are you sure you didn't do it?

936
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,800
If I tell you I didn't do it, will you believe me?

937
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,000
No.

938
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,280
I can't believe anything anymore!

939
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,440
I can come back, any time if you have more questions.

940
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,360
Sung-mo.

941
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,120
Please don't kill me.

942
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,480
I know it seems shameless,

943
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,240
but I don't want to die here.

944
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,840
I'm sure that person is watching.

945
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,000
The only person

946
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,160
who can save you.

947
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,960
(He is Psychometric)

948
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,120
What are you doing

949
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,120
on your precious day off? That'll give you a headache.

950
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,400
- Want to try? - No, thanks.

951
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,920
You shuffle it, and you solve it.

952
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,120
How ridiculous.

953
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,880
There.

954
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,800
If you know the formula, it's easier than you think.

955
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,080
Don't think of just matching one side,

956
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,360
but do it one by one, thinking that you're matching

957
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,120
all six sides at once.

958
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,840
How can I think of all six sides at once?

959
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,080
Thinking of only one side would work??

960
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,000
Thinking of only one side would be convenient.

961
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,920
But I want it to be complete

962
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,920
both on this side

963
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,680
and that side,

964
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,600
without any flaws.
