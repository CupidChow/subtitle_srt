1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,352
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,647
Great, he's awake.

3
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,316
What are you doing?

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,069
Didn't we agree on this?

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,238
Didn't you say you'd spare my life...

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,552
I'm trying to save your life

7
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,281
Squid Game 3

8
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:20,163
Episode 2: Starry Night

9
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,586
Depend on

10
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,229
Is everyone hidden?

11
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,064
I'm coming to find you

12
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,288
What are you doing?

13
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,754
that is...

14
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:15,552
Give yourself something to increase your confidence and strength

15
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,721
Thanos the bastard

16
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,348
I bought him so many drinks at the bar, that bastard

17
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,143
But you treat me like a fool

18
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,728
He always calls me "Nanxiu" That's enough

19
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,522
"Hey Namsu" "It's Namkyu"

20
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,023
"Nanxiu" "I said it was Nankui"

21
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,985
"Nankui"

22
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,489
I told that bastard so many times
His ears should be calloused by hearing so much

23
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,199
Son of a bitch

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,246
BenQ God

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,914
Want one?

26
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,040
Need not

27
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,459
I'm so generous because you killed Thanos

28
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,545
I said no

29
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,549
Don't ask me for it later.

30
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,053
Come with me and we'll wipe out half of humanity

31
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,982
Are you sure you can find the exit?

32
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,067
Shh!

33
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,904
I don't know the way by eyes.

34
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,869
Instead, follow the voices of the souls who died here.

35
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,707
Trust me and follow me honestly

36
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,168
If you don't believe me, get out!

37
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,505
No I don't believe you!
I'll follow you no matter what!

38
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,048
- Me too
- Me too!

39
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,759
Me...Me too

40
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,300
I was scared to death!

41
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,803
Why are you just standing there?

42
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,013
My key won't go in.

43
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,390
Can't insert it?

44
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
Get out of the way

45
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
Walk

46
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,139
Can I see your keys?

47
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,976
Can you lend me this?

48
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,496
Let me take a look

49
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,625
What's wrong?

50
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,836
The shape of the keyhole is different for each door

51
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,506
I think there are three kinds of circles, triangles and squares

52
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,759
We three each have a shape

53
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,885
Mine is a circle

54
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,138
Chunxi's is a triangle and yours is a square

55
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,641
How lucky we are to be together!

56
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,060
Of course

57
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,773
After we went to the bathroom together
I knew we were a good match.

58
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,109
- Right?
- yes

59
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,405
In this case
You should take our key, Hyun Joo

60
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,867
That way the action is more efficient

61
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,035
Is that okay?

62
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,424
Please forgive me

63
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,805
No. 310 eliminated

64
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,183
Clearance No. 260

65
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,444
calm!

66
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,822
I also arrested people.

67
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,675
This side

68
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
Depend on!

69
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,200
You go that way

70
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,455
Oh shit

71
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,717
Come if you have the ability!

72
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,981
Son of a bitch

73
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,653
What are you standing there for?

74
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,947
Help me kill him!

75
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,949
Kill him now!

76
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,499
Come here asshole!

77
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,466
Please forgive me

78
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,636
I have a wife and children, please help me

79
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,721
knew

80
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,349
etc.

81
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,101
What's wrong?

82
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,437
If you kill him
You can pass it, but I can't.

83
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,772
Can't we just kill one more?

84
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,651
How can I be sure you'll help me kill the next person?

85
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,653
You'll be through then.

86
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,406
So what do we do?

87
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,283
Kill at the same time

88
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,453
Stab him at the same time?

89
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,420
Wow, you are so wise

90
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,008
one two three

91
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,807
No. 235 was eliminated

92
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,028
This way!

93
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,448
You...

94
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,083
Mingji, did you see the look in his eyes when he died?

95
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,921
Slowly losing its luster

96
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,385
As hollow as a doll
Exactly the same as that bitch Shimei before she died

97
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,429
Really touching, isn't it?

98
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,640
what you do?

99
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,269
We can use this to open the door

100
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,442
stand up

101
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,278
We killed half of them.

102
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,284
You are really wise

103
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747
Wait for me

104
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,635
No. 105 was eliminated

105
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,387
Clearance No. 96

106
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,820
Damn, you saw that, didn't you?

107
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,822
But you're shrinking like a dead mouse
Stand aside and watch?

108
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,740
You should help her.

109
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,117
That bitch likes you.

110
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,080
So please be a man this time, Min-soo, okay?

111
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,056
Chunxi

112
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,019
Chunxi

113
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
Get out of the way

114
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,319
I just need to kill that girl.

115
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,951
Why don't you give me that old woman?

116
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,316
Depend on!

117
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,531
No

118
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,045
It's a triangle. You open it.

119
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,254
It's a triangle. You open it.

120
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,465
Get out of the way

121
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,723
Where is this exit?

122
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,392
- Wait a moment
- Oh shit

123
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,520
No! Wait!

124
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
Depend on!

125
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,758
let me see

126
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,886
Can you walk?

127
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,849
Let's go. Someone will hear the noise and come over.

128
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,480
careful

129
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,441
No. 232 was eliminated

130
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,861
Clearance No. 349

131
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,601
That's it you see!

132
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,230
These puppet-like eyes

133
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,360
Isn’t it super exciting?

134
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,657
No. 411 was eliminated

135
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,620
Clearance No. 124

136
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,374
Clearance No. 333

137
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,626
He cleared the level

138
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,128
who?

139
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,131
- My friend
- Your friend?

140
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,426
The one who switched teams with you?

141
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,305
I told him that he would come to help me after I cleared the customs.

142
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,058
Don't count on it. It's not easy to find us.

143
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,560
He promised me

144
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,436
He will come

145
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,688
BenQ God

146
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,648
where you go?

147
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,526
I'm looking for someone

148
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,904
The girl you were having an affair with?

149
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,825
So what if you find her? You want to protect her?

150
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,536
Then I will protect that pregnant woman with you.

151
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,415
If you dare to touch her, I will kill you.

152
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,462
The person who has always been so rational has now become a drama queen.

153
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,052
You're not just having an affair, you're in love with her

154
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,430
Boy, you're in love with her.

155
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,058
You really love her.

156
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,854
When we met and got to know each other, love grew wildly

157
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,066
You and I will become unforgettable memories

158
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,568
This cliché love...

159
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,486
I'll help you find her

160
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,071
I don't need your help

161
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,908
If you're looking for her
What about meeting someone from the blue team?

162
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,993
What are you going to do?

163
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,207
Who cares? I've already cleared the game.

164
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,543
No, you softie.

165
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,630
BenQ Master of MG Token
Otherwise you'll go bankrupt.

166
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,427
Chunxi! Chunxi...

167
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,147
No. 400 eliminated

168
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:13,193
We have to kill the BenQ master
Every blue team member we saw

169
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,111
Think about it

170
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,322
The rule is to kill one person to pass the level

171
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,992
But it doesn't say we can't kill more.

172
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,661
So if we kill more assholes

173
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,706
Then the Red Team won't have that many people to kill.

174
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:31,002
That is to say, every time we kill one more blue team
Eliminate one red team

175
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,922
That way there will be two more bonuses.

176
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,176
Do you understand?

177
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,888
What do you think?

178
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,098
Pretty sensible, right?

179
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,100
No. 394 was eliminated

180
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,729

Depend on!

182
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,181
Hold on a little longer

183
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,352
This side

184
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,691
Sit down for a while

185
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,902
Let me see

186
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,907
Sprained?

187
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,369
Possibly a broken ankle

188
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,830
What to do?

189
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
She shouldn't walk on that ankle anymore.

190
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,920
Let's stay here for now and see what happens.

191
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,882
Don't do this for me

192
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,678
I'm hiding here by myself

193
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,555
Go find the exit.

194
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,390
I...

195
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,850
Stay here with her

196
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,270
- What?
- Let's go, Hyun Joo

197
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,692
We've already been a burden to you.

198
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,497
- Oh my god
- What's wrong?

199
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,873
Oh my god.

200
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,416
My water broke

201
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,503
What...what to do?

202
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,835
Please don't kill me

203
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,134
Sir, don't you remember me?

204
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,219
When playing "Find a Friend"

205
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,389
The three of us entered the room together

206
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,058
You came with your mother, right?

207
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,811
I also have a sick mother outside

208
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,274
She has cancer and is now lying in a hospital bed

209
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,198
Please forgive me

210
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,431
Go to hell!

211
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,779
No. 172 was eliminated

212
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,949
Clearance No. 203

213
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,206
Take a deep breath and then exhale

214
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,541
1.2

215
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,335
Ouch, shhh

216
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,379
- Hey! Stop!
- One, two, three, push hard

217
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,550
That's it. Just do it again.

218
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,053
Hyun Joo

219
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,180
Come and hold Chunxi's hand

220
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,765
good

221
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,143
Are you ready? Try harder.

222
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,481
one two three!

223
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,413
I think we've been here before.

224
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,832
Can you actually hear those voices?

225
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,918
Shh!

226
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,844
That's the door!

227
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,809
I heard the dead calling me from there

228
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,276
Circle

229
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,156
My keys are shaking

230
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,658
This is the exit!

231
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,369
I believe you, Dragon Palace Fairy

232
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,048
Miss?

233
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,185
Elimination of number six

234
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,105
No. 447 was eliminated

235
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,472
You disgusting bastard.

236
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,225
You think you can hurt me?

237
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,483
Don't do this

238
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,985
I will eliminate all your bad karma.

239
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,904
you...

240
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,699
You are looking for him, right?

241
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,910
The one who betrayed you

242
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,663
I saw him

243
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,500
He was just outside

244
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,877
He hurt his leg

245
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,339
I went there and left a trail of blood.

246
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,218
Go kill him

247
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,222
Go kill him

248
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,977
If you kill him, all the bad karma will be eliminated.

249
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,673
I saw the head

250
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,924
Come try harder

251
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,554
one two three!

252
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,810
No. 440 was eliminated

253
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,355
Clearance No. 192

254
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,898
Excuse me

255
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,026
Have you seen Shimei?

256
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,487
Tall with short hair

257
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,158
Nan Kui wants to kill her and I must find her!

258
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,828
I must find her please help me find her!

259
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,943
Gods of Heaven and Earth...

260
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,613
(exit)

261
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,698
Thanks

262
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:23,338
When we met and got to know each other, love grew wildly

263
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,092
You and I will eventually...

264
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,309
When we met and got to know each other, love grew wildly

265
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,729
You and I will eventually...

266
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,405
You and I will become unforgettable memories

267
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,659
Hey, are you asleep?

268
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,328
Wake up

269
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,332
Hey, wake up.

270
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,001
Let's play together. I'm so bored.

271
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,837
I'm telling you to wake up!

272
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,797
Let's go

273
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,970
Are you pretending to sleep?

274
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,222
Go quickly

275
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,975
Let me wake him up first.

276
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,352
Never mind you

277
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,437
Hello!

278
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,859
BenQ God, I just want to play a little bit

279
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,799
Is there really an exit?

280
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,551
It was the gods of heaven and earth who led me to find it.

281
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,137
Then why didn't you go out?

282
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,974
Collect all three keys to open the door

283
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,433
I have circles and you have triangles and squares

284
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,601
You can open the door now.

285
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,812
are you sure?

286
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,690
Otherwise, why would I bring you along?

287
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,900
etc.

288
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,569
How do you know the way back there?

289
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,488
I think the road looks the same.

290
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,282
You stupid idiot

291
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,661
I don't see the road with my eyes

292
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,457
But listen to the voice of the gods of heaven and earth

293
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,850
- It will be fine soon. Try harder.
- One more time

294
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,036
A little princess

295
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,755
Hyun Joo holding her baby

296
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,903
Chunxi

297
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,393
Depend on!

298
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,496
(exit)

299
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,507
Hyun Joo!

300
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,758
I found the exit

301
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,677
We can go out together.

302
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,346
Come on, come on

303
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,382
BenQ God!

304
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,926
Did you take down another one?

305
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,390
right

306
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,020
What's wrong?

307
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,521
Is there anyone else inside?

308
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,857
No

309
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,194
- MG Token My Servant I am Thanos
- Let's go the other way.

310
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,365
We're going to wipe out half of humanity.
But we're running out of time.

311
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,993
Hyun Joo said she found a way out

312
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,662
It must be not far away

313
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,457
Can't we just stay here and wait until the game is over?

314
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,709
That's too dangerous

315
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,879
Others will come to us when they hear the child crying.

316
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,899
There is really an exit

317
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,866
idiot

318
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,494
I said it all

319
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,954
Collect all three keys to open the door

320
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,551
Thank you, God of Heaven and Earth

321
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,347
Stupid Bitch

322
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,141
No!

323
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,895
God damn bastard!

324
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,690
You will burn in the fire of hell for eternity!

325
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:13,112
The gods of heaven and earth will smash your head
Shatter your spine

326
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:17,535
Grind your internal organs into mud!

327
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,788
Excuse me

328
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,091
Have you seen Shimei?

329
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,471
Bro I...

330
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,683
I really wanted to argue.

331
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,519
I...

332
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,606
I was never in the Marines, this is all made up.

333
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,067
I never even served in the military, never even touched a gun.

334
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,654
Even my tattoos are fake

335
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,366
I tell these lies just to become brothers with you guys.

336
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,244
I feel like I'm with you guys.

337
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,289
I am a loser...

338
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,001
Maybe I can be tough for once

339
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,463
It's all your fault

340
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,551
elder brother

341
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,347
I'm really going to bring the magazine with me, I swear

342
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,643
I have collected them all and I just need to bring them over.

343
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,607
But suddenly...

344
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,362
Suddenly I was scared

345
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,534
It's all your fault!

346
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,954
You killed them!

347
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,540
You killed them!

348
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,751
It's you!

349
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,257
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

350
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,592
Please spare me!

351
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,679
Please don't kill me

352
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,183
You bastard!

353
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,162
No. 350 Elimination

354
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,290

355
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,850
(exit)

356
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,771
Nan Kui wants to kill Shi Mei

357
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,817
I have to find her

358
00:44:55,484 --> 00:45:00,364
I must find Shimei

359
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,286
Please help me find her. I must find her.

360
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,664
I have to find her

361
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,583
Help

362
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,547
You should have died long ago.

363
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,428
But he survives by sucking the life out of others

364
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,804
You shameless...

365
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,473
Waste stuff

366
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,478
Are you just standing aside and watching?

367
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,109
That bitch likes you.

368
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,405
You are so brave!

369
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,950
Who do you think I am?

370
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,995
Get lost!

371
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,753
You are so brave!

372
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,298
Who do you think I am...

373
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,601
Minxiu

374
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
- Shimei
- No. 380 was eliminated

375
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,243

378
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,923
Hold the child.

379
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,112
Mother-in-law

380
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,453
Is it my fault? Blame me?

381
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,580
What about you?

382
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,167
How come you are the only one who came back alive?

383
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,218
It's you

384
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,263
You planned this all yourself, didn't you?

385
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,641
Playing dirty tricks on us just to win the game

386
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:40,023
You killed them
You killed them all you bastard!

387
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,722
Rongzhi

388
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,068
No

389
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,154
Get out of the way

390
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,157
Rong Zhi, no, you can't do this.

391
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,159
Get out of my way. I can't do it.

392
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,537
I couldn't get anybody to do that.

393
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,915
So I'm dying.

394
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,917
Mom, I'm dying.

395
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,169
I'm dying

396
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,504
I'm dying and I can't kill anyone.

397
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,715
No one was killed

398
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,509
Then you stab me.

399
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,804
I've lived long enough.

400
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,433
Rongzhi

401
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,644
Stab me with a knife

402
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:04,191
In this case
You, Chunxi and her child can all survive.

403
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,798
Don't come over here

404
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,230
Go to hell!

405
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,639
It's all your fault

406
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,394
Blame you...

407
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,597
How can I...

408
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,268
Mom, how could I do this to you?

409
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,353
Yong Shik, listen to me.

410
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,106
It's okay

411
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,441
Please...

412
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,942
Please just kill me

413
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,486
Chunxi, go!

414
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,528

- One minute

415
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,739
- Yong Shik, let's do it
- One minute left

416
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,575
Just let her stab me.

417
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,340

418
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,110

419
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,803

420
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,317
It's all my fault

421
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,429

Please spare my son!

427
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,224
I killed him!

428
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,560
