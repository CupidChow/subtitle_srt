1
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:42,792
Please clean up the eliminated players

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,420
Repeat

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,466
Please clean up...

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
OMG...

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,860
Oh my god, it's thrilling

6
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,322
Luckily I like hunting.

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,656
I owe you a favor

8
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,284
You're welcome. It was really enjoyable.

9
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,203
Come

10
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,920
Looks like you two are having a great time.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,339
A little trouble for you guys?

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,382
We’re just getting started

13
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,259
I heard more upstairs

14
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,511
- Yeah?
- right

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,846
Let's go

16
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,414
Squid Game 3

17
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:10,505
Episode 3: I Don't Blame You

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,152
Hello

19
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,864
Have you seen my necklace?

20
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,366
The cross necklace contains medicine

21
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,411
- No
- are you sure?

22
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,290
I didn't see

23
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,252
Where did I lose it?

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,297
Depend on...

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,264
I left something in the playground and I have to find it

26
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,311
I...I want to find it quickly.

27
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,607
No, you can't go back.

28
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,068
Really! You just...

29
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,738
Please, ok?

30
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,073
I can't do anything without that.

31
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,662
Damn it! I have to find that thing!

32
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,561
Please bear with us, we don't have time.

33
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,438
But...

34
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,566
Why on earth are you helping me?

35
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,279
If you want to live, do as I say.

36
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,167
Oh baby, I know baby

37
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,171
She's just hungry.

38
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,135
Do you want to try it?

39
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:43,383
Congratulations to everyone for making it through the fourth game

40
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:48,014
Now announce the results of this round of games

41
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,733
A total of 35 players were eliminated in the fourth game

42
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,153
There are currently 25 players left

43
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,948
The total amount of prize money accumulated so far is 43.1 billion won

44
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,995
Each participant received 1.724 billion won

45
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:17,168
Now for a general vote
To decide whether to continue the game

46
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,850
I have always been a spectator.
I like it very much

47
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,397
But putting on the uniform and participating in it
It's a brand new experience

48
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,148
How can I describe this feeling?

49
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:45,488
Like Maasai warriors stalking the African wilderness

50
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,410
Although I have hunted many times in Africa
But this time it's definitely another realm

51
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,995
Depend on me...

52
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,206
Am I the only one who didn't go?

53
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,625
That damn helicopter was late.

54
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,003
I spent so much money on that piece of junk.

55
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,507
Are you sure it's the helicopter?

56
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,218
Or were you too drunk to wake up?

57
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:08,928
Did you know?

58
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,597
When you don't speak

59
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,933
Quite charming.

60
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,102
No wonder Chairman Wu gave you the power.

61
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,105
You've done an excellent job here.

62
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,107
Let us enjoy the fun of watching the game

63
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,234
Gives a sense of participation

64
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,572
I am just carrying out Chairman Wu's legacy.
Let VIPs get a more extreme entertainment experience

65
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,243
Let's raise a glass
Let's remember the legendary President Wu, right?

66
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,663
- Dear President Wu
- President Wu

67
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,958
Sir, I am Administrator Number Four.

68
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,469
explain

69
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,638
We've lost contact with the operating room.

70
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,600
Go down and check the situation yourself.

71
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,885
(Director Choi)

72
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,680
Hello?

73
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,141
Officer Huang turned out to be just as I expected.

74
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,561
I did some research
Captain Park's identity is somewhat suspicious

75
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:45,273
First of all, no one around here knows his background.

76
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,276
I asked the vendors and fishermen in the market

77
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,820
I want to know where he is from and whether he has a family.

78
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,155
Which school did you graduate from?

79
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,949
It seems no one knows

80
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,160
In addition, his resident registration book
It says his name is Park Young-gil

81
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,246
But no one knows anyone with this name.

82
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,166
Everyone asked me if I remembered the name wrong.
Do you think it's suspicious?

83
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,586
We still can't tell.
He killed the drone operator.

84
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,799
I know but this person is definitely a ghost

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,677
More than that
Remember the tall captain on the other ship?

86
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,180
Captain Park introduced himself as a native of Wujin

87
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,934
Still no one knows this person!

88
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,271
Even my local brothers have never heard of this person

89
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,855
He is a ghostly figure.

90
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,149
Come soon!

91
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,443
Saw the island

92
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,028
I have to hang up and call you back

93
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay, I'll investigate further.
Just be careful, Captain Park.

94
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,204
Let's go

95
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,134
Lower the drone's altitude

96
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,930
It's time to vote

97
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,682
It seems

98
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,144
What do you think about this year's voting process?

99
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,228
Looks really exciting

100
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,731
Voting is more exciting than the game itself

101
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,359
1.7 billion won is more than one million US dollars

102
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,902
For people like them, this is an astronomical figure.

103
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,446
They should want to stop here, right?

104
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,909
The following players who have survived to this day
But they all killed their way here.

105
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,370
Most people are probably thinking about

106
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,250
"How much more can I get if more people die?"

107
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:32,173
Now among the remaining 25 people
16 people have already worn the circle

108
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,799
After the riot after the black light

109
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,346
Those people dare not easily go against the majority

110
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,515
The player with the lowest number will vote first.

111
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,769
Please vote for No. 39

112
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,738
To continue the game, press the circle button

113
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,493
If you want to end the game, press the cross button

114
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,088
No. 84

115
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,846
No. 96

116
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,354
No. 100

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,403
No. 124

118
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,835
No. 125

119
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,622
No. 149

120
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,804
No. 163

121
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,455
No. 192

122
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,506
gentlemen

123
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,593
Let's just stop here, okay?

124
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,639
Please have mercy on me, an old woman. Please

125
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,605
Please everyone

126
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,943
Please, let this all end.

127
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,406
If you think the money is not enough

128
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,910
I'll give you all of mine.

129
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,248
I can give you all my money.

130
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,135
listen to me

131
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,389
I've lived long enough

132
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,812
It doesn't matter if I die here.

133
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:24,905
But we can't
Let the child and her mother die?

134
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,827
Please, everyone.

135
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,204
I beg you

136
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,833
Please vote for No. 192

137
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,379
Please sir!
Please save that child and her mother.

138
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,090
Please have mercy on me, an old woman!
Please!

139
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,969
Please let this child and her mother out!

140
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,055
Please let them out...

141
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,874
Confirm identity

142
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,565
(Scan No. 5 completed)

143
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,776
Who are the dead?

144
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,194
This is number seven.

145
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,571
This is number 25

146
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,538
Follow these soldiers

147
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,585
There are cameras in your room, so be careful.

148
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,193
It's the last person's turn to vote.

149
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,823
No. 456 Please vote

150
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,918
No. 456 has abandoned the vote

151
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,337
Among the 25 voters

152
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:51,050
16 people voted for the circle, 8 people voted for the cross, and 1 person abstained from voting.

153
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:56,889
According to your free and democratic voting results
We will play the next game tomorrow

154
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,560
Hope you all have a good time tonight

155
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,104
Thank you for your hard work.

156
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,601
The organizer was indeed very good at predicting things

157
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,812
The difference in tickets is bigger than I expected.

158
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,149
Hearing the old woman's speech
I almost cried.

159
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,151
How touching!

160
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,696
Do you think she really wants to?
Give up all your money?

161
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,616
She is probably getting old and confused.

162
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,495
This is a crazy woman who can even kill her own son

163
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,749
Just to save a
A woman and a child I just met

164
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,460
I can understand her.

165
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,380
After all, I wanted to bury my son alive many times.

166
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,562
What's happening?

167
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,234
Deaths of No. 5, No. 7 and No. 25

168
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,361
Who did it?

169
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,946
There was a gunfight

170
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,864
It looks like it was done by No. 16

171
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,533
Number 16?

172
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,535
The doctor who was responsible for the organ harvesting?

173
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,832
The only thing missing from the scene was his body.

174
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,359
Show me the status of the soldiers on standby

175
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,030
No. 5, No. 7, No. 11

176
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,658
The 25th hasn't come back yet.

177
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,994
What about number 16?

178
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,454
In the room

179
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,592
The tide is going out

180
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,596
Let's go now while the tide is still low.

181
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,308
Let the drone fly back

182
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,643
yes

183
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
etc.

184
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,315
Fly the drone back to shore

185
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,778
How come you saw something?

186
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,866
I seem to have been to this coast before

187
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,119
Captain Park tried to get to the shore

188
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,705
There are too many reefs and it's too dangerous

189
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,083
Please, I need to confirm one thing.

190
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,273
Eat it

191
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,616
Even if it's hard, you still have to eat.

192
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,370
If the mother lives, the child can live

193
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,720
Drink more water, you will feel thirsty.

194
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,056
sorry

195
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,435
It's all because of me

196
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,272
Don't think like that

197
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,651
Start now

198
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,029
Just take care of your children.

199
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:28,203
Don't think about anything else except yourself and your children.

200
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,462
Okay?

201
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,654
Bring number 16 to me after lights out

202
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,075
Track location 11 and report back

203
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,827
Yes, sir.

204
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,414
Number 11 is coming

205
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,266
You did what happened in the operating room?

206
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
Why?

207
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,732
We just from these
Just taking some organs from the scum who are destined to die

208
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,400
What are you playing at?

209
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,738
You are the one who is playing with your life

210
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,531
What do you want?

211
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,993
Arrange me and No. 16 to patrol the perimeter tomorrow

212
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,871
That doctor?

213
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,624
Do you know each other?

214
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,044
Get us another boat.

215
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,172
It's not easy to escape from here.

216
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
You know it well

217
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,764
I heard the VIPs are coming.

218
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:16,645
If we disappear quietly
Good for you too

219
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,106
Isn't that right?

220
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,374
Junhao

221
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,585
Follow me

222
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,614
This is where I got shot.

223
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,449
Are you sure?

224
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,409
To determine

225
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,662
Their island must be nearby.

226
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,705
knew

227
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,832
It's getting dark, let's go back to the boat

228
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,585
I will start searching again tomorrow morning.

229
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,463
The island must be nearby and we will definitely find it.

230
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,924
- Check your surroundings
- yes

231
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,336
Do you blame yourself for everything?

232
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,523
No matter how you look at it

233
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,695
This world is unfair

234
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,199
Bad people do bad things

235
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,453
But they blame others and live freely

236
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,749
Good people blame themselves for every little thing

237
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,213
Self-suffering

238
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,135
This is my appearance.

239
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,513
He is so soft-hearted and stupid

240
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,392
He blamed himself for the company's bankruptcy

241
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,104
The creditor beat him up and he blamed himself

242
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,858
He blamed himself for being cheated in the casino

243
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,360
Even the most trusted friends

244
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,779
He only blames himself for running away with his money.

245
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,159
He was extremely drunk that night

246
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,538
One day I finally had enough of his wimpy behavior

247
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,709
I couldn't stand it anymore so I yelled at him

248
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,129
“I really regret it
I suffered so much to give birth to you.

249
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,758
I'll just pretend that I never gave birth to you.

250
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,220
Get out of here you complete piece of shit!"

251
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,435
That night...

252
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,730
He overdosed on medication

253
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,526
The suicide note left behind reads
He's sorry for being such a loser.

254
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:40,200
I pushed him to the hospital.

255
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,577
I pray to God

256
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,539
I swear I'll save my child.
I'm willing to do anything

257
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,043
Even if I have to jump into the fire pit, I will do it

258
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,343
But guess what?

259
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,850
in the end...

260
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,940
I killed him.

261
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,324
I personally...

262
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,871
Killed his own child

263
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,809
gentlemen

264
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,313
Please can you help...

265
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,068
Sun Hee and her child?

266
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,786
I still believe
You are here to save us all.

267
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,584
sorry

268
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,046
I...

269
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,677
Not the one you're looking for

270
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,307
I didn't know I'd end up like this at my age.

271
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,187
It's because I've lived my life wrong.

272
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:38,818
Or is it because of those evil people upstairs that you mentioned?

273
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,281
But the kid is completely innocent.

274
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,744
It's not her fault that she was born in this hell.

275
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,830
Please, sir.

276
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,877
Please help Chunxi and her child survive

277
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,506
My son and I are no longer safe.

278
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:05,011
Please save Chunxi and her child.

279
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,138
Please, sir.

280
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,850
I beg you

281
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,852
Please, sir.

282
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,279
- Hello, stop the car
- good

283
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,870
It should be that house.

284
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,997
- But brother
- how?

285
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,125
What exactly are you looking for?

286
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,172
Evidence of Captain Park's evil intentions

287
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,674
- But brother
- Um

288
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,385
Do you have to go to this extent?

289
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,970
You're breaking into someone else's house?

290
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,848
This is not very authentic.

291
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,601
I won't force you to come in with me.
You just stand guard outside.

292
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,687
elder brother

293
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,106
Is this a real gun?

294
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,441
That's right, that bastard used this gun.

295
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,986
Killed the boss

296
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,446
Keep watch

297
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,591
Park Young-gil, that's right.

298
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,056
Oh shit

299
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,184
What does he think?

300
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,460
Damn it!

301
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,957
A new day begins

302
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:43,461
Roll call in ten minutes

303
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:48,256
Please get up and get ready

304
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,134
repeat

305
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,389
Roll call in ten minutes

306
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,352
Please get up and get ready

307
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,033
The sir has given her the keys to the ship.

308
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,705
Go back to the operating room.

309
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,665
Sir, is there a problem?

310
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,459
I always feel like something is not right

311
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,753
It doesn't make sense at all

312
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,424
Check again to see if there is anything you missed.

313
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,981
Granny Zhang...

314
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,008
No. 149 was eliminated

315
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,249
(Scan No. 16 completed)

316
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,839
Sir, I'm in the operating room.

317
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,257
Number 16 is dead

318
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,260
The doctor died?

319
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,681
- All soldiers line up immediately...
- I just scanned his chip and confirmed it's correct.

320
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,100
This must be the fault of No. 11.

321
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:31,022
She dressed No. 16 in sportswear to disguise him as a player

322
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,573
Who is that person in room 16?

323
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,620
It should be player 246

324
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,432
Today's tasks are as follows

325
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:11,561
Numbers 1 to 10 are responsible for monitoring the game area

326
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,815
No. 11 to No. 20 guard the outer area

327
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:20,780
No. 21 to No. 35 guard the inner facilities

328
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,543
Really

329
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,737
Rock Scissors Paper Take Back One

330
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,781
Disqualification

331
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,201
That bastard

332
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,329
Please note

333
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,499
The fifth game is about to begin

334
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,130
Please follow the staff's instructions

335
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,925
Repeat

336
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,348
The fifth game is about to begin

337
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,895
Please follow the staff's instructions

338
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,759
Oh shit

339
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,311
police!

340
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,191
Don't move

341
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,153
Stand up slowly

342
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,499
Chunxi

343
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,179
Give me the child

344
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,809
Need not

345
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,316
You might accidentally hurt your child.

346
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,226
Is number 222 too bad?

347
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,270
Her leg was injured.
Now with a child

348
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,439
She has too many obstacles.

349
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,192
Anyone betting on her to win the next game?

350
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,361
Only a fool would bet on her.

351
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,447
I bet

352
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,450
Can I ask why?

353
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,871
I was drunk and pressed the wrong number

354
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,332
Not surprising

355
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,710
But I'm not going to give up yet

356
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:56,674
Isn't there a saying
God cannot be everywhere, so he created mothers

357
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,761
Maybe No. 222 can make a difference

358
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,805
It depends on what the next game is.

359
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,352
Tell us, everyone is curious.

360
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,228
Then I'll show you

361
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,458
What is this?

362
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,885
I'm afraid if I don't keep this child

363
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,430
I'll be alone again

364
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,853
I think my children will be my family.

365
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,648
Will always be by my side

366
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,820
I know the road will be difficult

367
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,492
But I think I'll be happier if I have my own children

368
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,460
But because I...

369
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,757
Hyun Joo and Granny Jang both...

370
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,052
Because I...

371
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,688
Don't blame you

372
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,358
That's our choice

373
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,446
Granny Zhang, Hyun Joo

374
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,573
And you

375
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,284
We all made our own choices

376
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,332
I also have a daughter

377
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,255
I've never been a good father.

378
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:06,597
But after she was born and watched her grow up...

379
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,021
It's the happiest time of my life

380
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,400
Protect your children at all costs

381
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,487
I will help you

382
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,250
Oh shit!

383
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,794
This is bullshit.

384
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,838
No. 222's ankle is broken, what's going on...

385
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,256
What can she do up there?

386
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,716
Looks like you're screwed.

387
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,802
So may I make a suggestion?

388
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,595
Any suggestions?

389
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,390
Let the child and mother participate in the game together

390
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,935
You want to bring that kid into the game?

391
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,854
What good does this do me?

392
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,024
That sounds like an even bigger disadvantage.

393
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,278
As you said, a mother will do everything for her children.

394
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,571
Who knows?

395
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,575
This might make No. 222
Becoming a Marvel superhero?

396
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,077
Like Wonder Woman?

397
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,995
Wonder Woman is from DC

398
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,915
But anyway, this suggestion makes sense.

399
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,251
Do you want to try it?

400
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,418
I like

401
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,671
Sounds interesting

402
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,548
You should agree

403
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,467
No matter what, just do it this way

404
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,512
Anyway, I lose both ways, right? So...

405
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,931
Consider it a sacrifice...

406
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,975
To help you

407
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,061
- They're coming
- come on!

408
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,104
What the hell is this?

409
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,066
We should go to the other side.

410
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,698
Welcome to Game 5

411
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:35,287
The game you want to play is skipping rope

412
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:41,334
You have to jump rope while crossing the bridge

413
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:45,589
Reach the other side within 20 minutes

414
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:52,095
The order is determined by the player

415
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,432
Sit down for a while

416
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,242
Game Start

417
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,122
Dongdong

418
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,708
Who is it?

419
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,835
Your little friend

420
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,089
Come in

421
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:36,639
Children, turn around.

422
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,477
Children, children, bump into each other

423
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:46,649
Children, children, hop on one foot

424
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,571
Children, let's go!

425
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,016
We lived together

426
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,977
I will help you

427
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,272
What about my children?

428
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,191
The game is over in 20 minutes

429
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,945
You can leave the child here temporarily.
Come back to pick up the kids after crossing the bridge

430
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:37,159
All players must cross the bridge within the specified time.

431
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:43,415
All players who failed to arrive within the time limit
Will be eliminated

432
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,668
My child is not a gamer.

433
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:50,713
Everyone present is a player

434
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,423
No kidding.

435
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,760
Children have nothing to do with this game!

436
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:04,478
All those who fail to
All players who arrive will be eliminated

437
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,821
This game is worth watching

438
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:19,576
You can do it! Cheer up! No. 222

439
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,912
I thought you had given up

440
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,457
As Yankee great Yogi Berra said

441
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,210
“It’s not over until the end”

442
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,302
We can't keep wasting time like this!

443
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,306
Someone has to go first!

444
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,808
OK

445
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,186
Then you go first

446
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,484
You don't dare to just yell here.

447
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,028
So we just sit there and wait for death?

448
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,197
Someone has to go first

449
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,990
- Then you go.
- We still have time

450
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,200
Uncle

451
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,994
Let’s think clearly first

452
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,417
Please take my child with you.

453
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,051
Please

454
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,014
Nankui

455
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,517
How are you?

456
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,815
Hello

457
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,235
Get lost

458
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,779
Get out of here you piece of shit

459
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,539
Hey, is this why?

460
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,712
Damn! Give it to me

461
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,257
Get away! If you mess with me again I'll throw it away!

462
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,891
Listen to Minsu

463
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,809
Minxiu

464
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,025
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

465
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,652
Sorry, I really don't dare to go without it.

466
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,488
Please...

467
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:25,075
I'm so sorry I can't do anything without it

468
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,203
Oh shit!

469
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,082
If you want it, take it.

470
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,422
What the hell? Are you scared?

471
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,675
You stupid piece of shit

472
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,458
Great! Someone finally got on the bridge.

473
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,961
Come on!

474
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,670
No. 124 was eliminated

475
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,298
What a great start

476
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,504
I'll go there first and then come back to pick you up

477
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,174
It's okay. I can do it myself.

478
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,926
Your legs are definitely not in this state.

479
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,013
I will definitely come back

480
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,646
Excuse me

481
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,953
Wait why would he do that?

482
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,955
I really don't understand that guy.

483
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,125
It's crazy to come after winning.

484
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:24,005
But even so
If he helps No. 222, I will support him.

485
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,050
Come on No. 456!

486
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,649
Why doesn't he leave?

487
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:27,652
What is he doing?

488
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,904
There must be a gap in the bridge.

489
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:37,244
You can jump to number 456!

490
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,706
Just jump!

491
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,593
Great! Wow! Number 456 is awesome!

492
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,366
Clearance No. 456

493
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,160
- He did it
- I knew it!

494
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,411
I knew he could do it!

495
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,206
I knew 456 would work! Did you see it?

496
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,415
Saw it

497
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,462
Congratulations, kid, you're halfway there.

498
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:41,935
Chun Hee!

499
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,604
I'll pick you up right now!

500
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,749
Chun Hee!

501
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,667
fine

502
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,752
Just wait

503
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,193
- Cleared level 96
- You can do it!

504
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,695
Come on, jump again!

505
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,447
That's it! Come on up!

506
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,493
Oh shit!

507
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,328
No. 312 was eliminated

508
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,455
What are you doing?

509
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,500
What do you think?

510
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,711
I'm playing games

511
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:19,652
