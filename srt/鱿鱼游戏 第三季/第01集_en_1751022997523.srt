1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,108
Spare me...

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,327
Please forgive me

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,873
My daughter is very ill

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,052
Close your eyes

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,263
If you want to live, do as I say.

6
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,483
(Scan No. 246 completed)

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,069
No. 246 was eliminated

8
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,539
Squid Game 3

9
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:28,379
Episode 1: The Key and the Knife

10
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,979
Carry away

11
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,243
Why are you so cooperative now?

12
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,494
Not like your style

13
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,955
I thought about it

14
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,581
They're all going to die anyway.

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,876
It's not a bad thing to use their organs to save other people's lives.

16
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,963
That's the right way to think

17
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,966
I'm glad you finally figured it out.

18
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,636
I want to see

19
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,430
What are you looking at?

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,765
See how you do it

21
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,393
Why?

22
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,608
We are now
We are all on the same boat, aren't we?

23
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,611
We can't have any secrets between us, right?

24
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,795
Is he dead?

25
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,590
Still alive

26
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,551
Help me get him to the bed, quick.

27
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,552
good

28
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,014
Come and lift it to the bed

29
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,437
I can't see him near the boat.

30
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
How much did he drink last night?

31
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,943
Not to the point of being drunk

32
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,446
I counted the empty bottles and there were quite a few of them.

33
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,745
He probably came outside to throw up and fell into the ocean

34
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,622
The boat rocked quite badly last night

35
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,917
Could it be that I
Is this the noise you heard?

36
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,627
What did you hear?

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,589
I heard someone talking outside
Then there was a clang.

38
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,341
What time is that?

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,635
About three o'clock in the morning, right?

40
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,178
Yeah, almost.

41
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,847
So I went out to see what was going on.
Captain Park was already there

42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,268
We should wake everyone up and look for him together.

43
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,936
Let's search around first.

44
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,104
But Officer Huang

45
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,608
The current here is very fast.
He might have been swept away overnight.

46
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,278
If he got drunk and fell into the sea
That's definitely dead.

47
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,947
Do you have time to find a dead body?

48
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,283
Didn’t we say we had to find the island within four days?

49
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,414
We go to the nearest port
Find another drone operator

50
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,791
Let's go

51
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,523
Let's attack first.

52
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,692
Then we can't kill each other.

53
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,694
This will play into those people's hands

54
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,529
Do we have to endure small sacrifices for the sake of greater good?

55
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,700
Even if there are sacrifices now
This time, the game must be over.

56
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,327
Let's fight together and go home together

57
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,079
Those who are willing to go with us
Please come to the front

58
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,873
Why didn't you come with Zero One and bring me along?

59
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,166
After all, you are my friend

60
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,378
Mr. Cheng

61
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,301
Oh, Mr. Cheng

62
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,719
You are still alive

63
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,095
Fortunately you are still alive

64
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,723
Are you okay?

65
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,966
What about others?

66
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,019
What about positive times?

67
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,575
Take a good look at what happens when you play the hero

68
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,743
Qixun

69
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,233
A total of 35 players were eliminated last night.

70
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,777
There are currently 60 players left

71
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,489
The total amount of prize money accumulated so far is 39.6 billion won

72
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,409
Each participant received 660 million won

73
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:38,416
Now for a general vote
To decide whether to continue the game

74
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,255
Why didn't you kill me?

75
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,841
Why didn't you kill me?

76
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,135
Tell me! Why!

77
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,679
Why am I allowed to live? Why?

78
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,558
Shoot you bastards!

79
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,769
Shoot! Kill me too!

80
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,357
Why let me live?

81
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,445
What do you want me to do?

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,492
Why didn't you kill me?

83
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,287
You win!

84
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,416
Kill me now!

85
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,045
You win!

86
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,801
Please just kill me!

87
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,523
We are back in port for now.

88
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,692
They want to find another drone operator
Then return to the sea

89
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,614
Before the game ends
We must not let them discover this island.

90
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,740
clear

91
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,870
Hey Officer Huang! Contact me when you're ready to go.

92
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,374
-good
-Watch your step

93
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,714
What should I do if something goes wrong?

94
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,430
Kill them all

95
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,808
Don't let that policeman go either.

96
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:28,317
Now for a general vote
To decide whether to continue the game

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,114
Voting will be done in reverse order of player number

98
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,491
No. 456 Please vote

99
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,044
If you do not show your intention to vote by the count of three

100
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,046
will be deemed as a waiver

101
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,885
one two three

102
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:03,102
Player No. 456 gave up voting and was treated as abstention

103
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,355
Next, please vote for No. 448

104
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,835
Don't worry, no one will buy it, just invest with confidence

105
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,463
For random voting

106
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,008
No one is watching

107
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,371
We have eight administrators killed or wounded.
and 27 soldiers

108
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,957
Replace fallen soldiers with laborers

109
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,419
Repair damaged facilities as soon as possible

110
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,672
The guests will be arriving soon.

111
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,756
yes

112
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,340
Where did you learn to shoot?

113
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,219
I heard that all North Korean girls have to serve in the military.

114
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,303
Yes or no?

115
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,180
right

116
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,725
Why did you cross the border?

117
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,185
Are you too hungry over there?

118
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,604
Or

119
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,315
Are you in big trouble?

120
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,572
You said we are now on the same boat

121
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,241
Isn't it about getting to know each other better?

122
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,785
We'll meet outside alone when this is all over.

123
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,787
I'll tell you then

124
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
I don't want to wait that long

125
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,835
This is a good place for a date.

126
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,128
Do you want to stop by?

127
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,254
My story is a long one.

128
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
Let me see the operating room first.

129
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,924
All right

130
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,469
I know there's a place downstairs.

131
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,179
You will also like

132
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,188
According to your free and democratic voting results

133
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,274
We will play the next game tomorrow

134
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
Thank you for your hard work.

135
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,545
Hello No. 456

136
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,509
Is this all part of your plan?

137
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,388
You planned a rebellion to lure people out.

138
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,641
And then just kill them all in one fell swoop, right?

139
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,727
But he still looks like that

140
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,271
“Kill me!”

141
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,690
Is it just a show?

142
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,276
This person is so scary

143
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,820
That's right

144
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,198
They didn't kill him like they killed the others.
Brought him back here.

145
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,450
There must be a reason.

146
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:51,205
Anyway you let all those
The idiots with red cards all lost their lives

147
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,210
Thanks to you, the bonus is even bigger.
We also won the vote by a landslide

148
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,339
Let us thank him with warm applause.

149
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,592
Thank you so much!

150
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,345
It seems like you've been ours from the beginning.

151
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,725
You stupid idiot

152
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,519
What did I tell you?

153
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,146
You didn't come here voluntarily.

154
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,317
It's the vengeful spirits that are hovering over you
Lead you here

155
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,120
Did you hear that?

156
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,040
Your ears are ringing with the screams of your friends

157
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,255
No matter how you cover your ears, it won't help

158
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,383
The screams only get louder

159
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,889
Until the last moment of your life
These screams will be with you

160
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,943
-Let her go!
-let it go!

161
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,619
Are you okay?

162
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,649
How is it going?

163
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
Get some good stuff

164
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,532
Slow down

165
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,535
one two three!

166
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,834
It's okay, don't worry

167
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,088
Number 11 is ours now.

168
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,925
Is this guy doing well?

169
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,012
This is her gift to us.

170
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,431
Why did you bring her here?

171
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,395
Since we are all on the same boat

172
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,355
Isn’t it nice for everyone to get to know each other?

173
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,609
Those who came before us were

174
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,155
Misfortune comes from mutual distrust and concealment

175
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,367
But we trust each other
So there shouldn't be any secrets

176
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,453
So we agreed not to wear masks here.

177
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,040
Isn’t it?

178
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,683
Are you number 11?

179
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,478
Do you know how much money we lost because of you?

180
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,439
No time to talk about anything else

181
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
We have to hurry up to deliver on time. Let's get started.

182
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
come over

183
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,115
I'll tell you the process from the beginning

184
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,829
This is your gift

185
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,457
Is he still alive?

186
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,875
Yes, just in a coma

187
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,715
Okay, now we
Just open the gift for number 11?

188
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,722
-how?
-stop

189
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,057
What…what happened?

190
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,224
Put down the scalpel

191
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,893
-good
-Hey, why?

192
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,394
Back

193
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,146
Are you betraying me?

194
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,230
You crazy bitch!

195
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,715
Want to know why I crossed the border?

196
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,512
My commander is almost the same as you.

197
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,765
So I blew his head off

198
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,283
Spare me, I am not in the same group with these people.

199
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,578
I just want to make money.

200
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,498
Save this person

201
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,876
If he dies, you will die too.

202
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,890
Chunxi

203
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,021
Sweet potatoes have always been your favorite

204
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,096
Mr. Cheng

205
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,851
Eat something, even just a little.

206
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,526
I know

207
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:42,282
I know you want to save everyone's lives.

208
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,870
You just want to punish the bad guys and end it all

209
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,290
sorry

210
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,671
I should have found a way

211
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
I'll give you the magazine.

212
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,887
You have nothing to apologize for, Hyun Joo

213
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,348
Blame it on the tiger

214
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,520
I saw it, my mom saw it, everyone saw it

215
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,774
Dahu came to get the magazine but just as he was about to leave

216
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,278
He collapsed to the ground.

217
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,574
When Hyun Joo came to get it, a masked man broke in.

218
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,827
If my mother hadn't stopped me

219
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,122
She will die too.

220
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,665
Right Hyun Joo?

221
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,711
Being depressed won't bring anyone back to life

222
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,506
We who are still alive
Should we keep going? What do you think?

223
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,053
You have to eat, okay?

224
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,723
You will be thirsty so drink some water too

225
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,314
Oh, I feel like he has lost his soul.

226
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,089
(Motel)

227
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,175
(November 4, fourth day of search)

228
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,353
Is Officer Huang asleep?

229
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,396
Not yet

230
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,069
Since you didn't sleep,

231
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,322
Can we have a drink and chat?

232
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,991
OK, please come in.

233
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,497
I won't drink it.

234
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,875
Oh okay

235
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,717
What do you want to talk about? Please tell me.

236
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
right

237
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,390
that

238
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,975
It's Captain Park's business

239
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,271
You said he saved you.
You nearly drowned, didn't you?

240
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,234
Yes, I was shot on an island.
Fell into the sea

241
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,528
He rescued me and took me to the hospital

242
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,198
Do you remember anything else?

243
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,536
I woke up in the hospital
Then my mom told me that Captain Park saved me

244
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,038
What's wrong?

245
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,126
That's it

246
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,797
I said I heard some noise last night
So go out and check it out, right?

247
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,966
Yes, Captain Park also heard some noises.

248
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,760
I didn't think much about it at the time

249
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,516
But he actually held something in his hand

250
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,351
What?

251
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,519
screwdriver

252
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,020
Who is there?

253
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,398
Director Choi?

254
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,151
It's me, Captain Park.

255
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,695
screwdriver?

256
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,613
right

257
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,826
It's dark but I can definitely see it
He holds a screwdriver in his hand

258
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,953
Isn’t it strange when you think about it?

259
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,997
Why is he holding that thing in his hand?

260
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,040
Maybe he's fixing something.

261
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,628
But I remember when he came out
Said he wanted to sleep

262
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,798
Or maybe he grabbed a weapon for safety.

263
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,552
Yeah?

264
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,345
-But…
-Murphy

265
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,726
What do you think of the disappearance of the drone operator?
Related to him?

266
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,857
I have a pretty good instinct about this sort of thing.

267
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,651
Captain Park is a bit suspicious...

268
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,445
He saved my life

269
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,948
And he has been helping me search for that island for the past few years.

270
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,742
Even now it is still like this

271
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,327
I also know

272
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,331
I'm not saying he hurt the drone operator.

273
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,499
I just have a bad...

274
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,294
You last night
Did you drink with the drone operator too?

275
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,549
Yes I drank but not much, just a few glasses

276
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,221
We'll set off early tomorrow morning

277
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,014
Please go back to sleep.

278
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,143
Oh ok

279
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
And from tomorrow

280
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,982
No more drinking on the boat

281
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,112
good

282
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,218
The fourth game is about to begin

283
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,099
Please follow the staff's instructions

284
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,685
team leader

285
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,147
The VIPs have arrived

286
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,048
What you are seeing now is

287
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:18,053
Those who reject the democratic voting process

288
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:23,767
The fate of those who try to stop the game by violent means

289
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,272
We will not tolerate any

290
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:34,611
Irrational behavior that breaks the rules of the game

291
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,989
Such behavior
Will be punished according to our strict standards

292
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,994
Thank you for your cooperation

293
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,835
Welcome to the fourth game

294
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,548
This game will be played in two teams

295
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:01,012
Before starting the game, you must first divide into groups.

296
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:08,103
Please draw a ball from the gashapon machine in front of you one by one

297
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,988
The bullet did not hit any major organs or arteries.

298
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,990
I stitched him up but...

299
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
But what?

300
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,619
He lost a lot of blood

301
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,163
He needs a blood transfusion but there is no blood available.

302
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,168
Use my blood.

303
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,795
What is your blood type?

304
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,004
Blood Type O

305
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,507
That should be fine.

306
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,220
It doesn't matter
We don't even know what game to play.

307
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,933
If you play tricks, you're dead.

308
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,006
The next game to be played is hide and seek

309
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,340
hide and seek?

310
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:29,387
The Blue Team must find the exit and escape within 30 minutes.

311
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,641
Or avoid the Red Team before the time runs out

312
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,101
What about the captors?

313
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,853
Just like when we were kids

314
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,982
We just need to catch them?

315
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:46,070
The red team, the arresters, must

316
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,656
Find the blue team members and kill them

317
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,579
Kill them?

318
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,747
That's right

319
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,626
The Red Team must find the Blue Team and kill them

320
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,503
If you fail to kill any opponent
will be eliminated

321
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,256
These people are going to kill us?

322
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,215
Yes

323
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,239
What's this?

324
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:36,287
What you get
It is the key to each room in the game room.

325
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,625
This key can open the door

326
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,629
But once the door is opened, it cannot be locked again

327
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:49,050
So they can
Find a place to hide and use the key to escape

328
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
Then it would be too easy for them to win!

329
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,095
-That's right!
- Much easier than us.

330
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,348
We have to kill them.

331
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,725
And only with bare hands

332
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,937
Yeah, that's not fair.

333
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,482
They won't come to us and ask us to kill them.

334
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,361
Do you expect us to kill people with our bare hands?

335
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:12,490
We understand your concerns

336
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:17,704
So the red team also has a small gift

337
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,999
Please open the box to view

338
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,630
Thanks

339
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,157
This knife can be used to attack blue team members

340
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,369
But the arresters are not allowed to attack each other with knives.

341
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,789
Could you at least give us some protective gear?

342
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:06,377
Give them a knife and let us run around empty-handed?

343
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,754
that is

344
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,547
You also have to give us equipment.

345
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,260
We only have one key.
This is not fair!

346
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,389
But you can use the key to open the door and escape.

347
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,474
That's right

348
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,852
Just hide.
It's easier for you!

349
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,896
-yes
- It's just easier for you.

350
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,773
Brother Zheng

351
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,485
Isn't that what you are good at?

352
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,446
Hiding like a mouse

353
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,364
Before the game starts

354
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,118
You have one last chance to change your fate.

355
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:44,373
If someone is dissatisfied with the team he is in

356
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,543
You can switch teams with others before the game starts

357
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,462
And exchange vests and props

358
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,173
What? Interchangeable?

359
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,257
That's right

360
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:59,347
Props and vests can be exchanged if both parties agree

361
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,850
But after the game starts

362
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:08,356
It is strictly forbidden to take off or exchange the vest

363
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,485
Please choose carefully

364
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,927
This is our new drone operator.

365
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,053
Nice to meet you all

366
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,597
It's not easy to find him here, so treat him well.

367
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,682
-yes
-yes

368
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,227
Thanks

369
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,939
Okay, put on your life jacket first.

370
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,732
No more accidents.

371
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,442
Did you hear that?

372
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,527
Heard

373
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,738
Where are you? Come quickly, we're leaving.

374
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,366
Officer Huang, you guys go ahead. I won't follow you.

375
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,243
What are you talking about?

376
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,037
There's something I need to check.

377
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
Are you still struggling with that?

378
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,378
My intuition is usually right.

379
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:16,299
If I find anything I'll call you.
Until then, be careful and pay special attention to Captain Park.

380
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,258
Director Choi…

381
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,596
Okay, let's go.

382
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,056
- Let's go
-good

383
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,243
What on earth is wrong with you? You suddenly appeared

384
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,871
And called me early in the morning

385
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,916
I'm so busy and exhausted

386
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,462
The boss is dead

387
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,964
What?

388
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,342
He died? How did he die?

389
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,677
It’s a long story

390
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:07,266
Wait then why didn't you call me?

391
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,519
Because I'm on the right path now...

392
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,313
He is not like that...

393
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,110
You know
A game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Take Back One"?

394
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:22,031
-Know
-We played this game and...

395
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,911
All he needs to do is take back another...

396
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,707
never mind

397
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,710
Let's go drink some hangover soup.

398
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,380
Finish what you're saying, then what?

399
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,174
I'll tell you on the way.

400
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,052
I really don't understand you

401
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,136
(Wujin Interior Design)

402
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,390
How can someone die playing rock-paper-scissors?

403
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,352
None of you are leaving here alive.

404
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,937
Then I should...

405
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,649
Only I am the fairy of Dragon Palace

406
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,901
Can guide you in life

407
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,903
- We trust you, ma'am.
-We will follow you

408
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,196
Gods of Heaven and Earth...

409
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:08,452
From here you can see all the paths to the other side

410
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,206
It is not seen with the eyes!

411
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,084
Gods of Heaven and Earth

412
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,921
Holding my hand and leading the way!

413
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,426
Those who follow me will have eternal life

414
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,844
Minxiu

415
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,932
-Anyone who stands in my way will surely die!
-Have you ever killed anyone?

416
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,979
Hey, no time.
If you can't do it, change teams.

417
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,315
You are quite good at hiding.

418
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,319
Minxiu, I looked for you everywhere last night.

419
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,154
But I just can't find it

420
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,906
Where are you hiding?

421
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,660
Are you afraid of me?

422
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,541
You hid it well. Good job.

423
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,004
That bitch thinks she's Wonder Woman

424
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,133
That bitch treated me like a fool and she actually...

425
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,975
Did you see it?

426
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,104
Damn, you saw that, didn't you?

427
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,316
But you're shrinking like a dead mouse
Stand aside and watch?

428
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,903
That bitch you're supposed to help likes you

429
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,657
Minxiu

430
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,869
I like the way you look now

431
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,916
Just keep it like this when you are having fun.

432
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,381
Thanos the bastard is dead

433
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,217
The rest of our little group is dead.
It's just you and me

434
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,261
I'd be alone if you died too.

435
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,476
So please be a man this time, Min-soo, okay?

436
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,272
You can do it brother Minxiu

437
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,816
Minxiu

438
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,111
See you later Minsu

439
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,739
Chunxi and I exchanged

440
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,199
You take the key

441
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,368
That way we can all live

442
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,246
Mind your own business.

443
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,705
I will take care of myself

444
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,042
How can that be?

445
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,503
I know you can't do anything with a knife

446
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,296
Stop pretending to know me well.

447
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,048
Maybe I don't understand, but there is one thing I know...

448
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,010
You can't kill anyone.

449
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,308
Give me the knife

450
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,772
I'll kill the others as soon as possible and then come to you

451
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:47,027
I will protect you and the child, Chunxi

452
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,907
Do you think killing is easy?

453
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,036
if only

454
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,749
I can take you and the money away from here
I'd kill them all.

455
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,043
To protect my children
I can do anything too.

456
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,298
That…

457
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,430
You kill me.

458
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,226
I'll find you when the game starts

459
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
Stab me and get out

460
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,320
That way you and your child can survive.

461
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,995
Give me the knife

462
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,877
I'll switch teams with someone else.

463
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,505
We can stay together...

464
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,048
mom

465
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,925
You have a bad knee

466
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,803
Once inside

467
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:59,391
Those people will rush over with knives raised

468
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,102
If we stay together

469
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,897
Both must die.

470
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,568
No, you can't do it.

471
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,572
How could you possibly kill someone with this?

472
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,620
When we were kids, you always

473
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,332
Like a fool, let people beat me

474
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,336
You never hurt anyone, not once.

475
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,629
What about you?

476
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,966
Can you kill someone with a knife?

477
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,302
Dad always beat you but you never fought back

478
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,852
I'll come

479
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,190
I try my best

480
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,327
Thanks

481
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,495
pretty

482
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,796
Thank you very much

483
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,303
The one you are willing to exchange with me...

484
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,357
listen to me

485
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,817
If you switch teams with me

486
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,321
I'll stay with you
I'll protect you till the end, okay?

487
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,533
But then you have to kill people too.

488
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,993
Could you…

489
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:45,331
Just leave it alone

490
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,958
I'll still stay with you

491
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,754
Please believe me, I will keep my promise.

492
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
Okay?

493
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,758
Okay?

494
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,286
Oh shit

495
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,042
What? You have something against me?

496
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,253
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

497
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,175
You want to blame everything on me?

498
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,635
What terrible mistake have I made?

499
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,055
We can't win

500
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,392
We can't win anyway.

501
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,230
Damn it, stop looking at me like that!

502
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,606
It's not my fault!

503
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,278
If we had fought those bastards in the selection circle

504
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,613
Maybe we can win

505
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,741
We may win the battle
Then win the vote!

506
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,868
It's all your fault

507
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,580
They are all because
Your ridiculous plan is dead!

508
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,667
It was you! You killed them!

509
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,472
The game is about to begin

510
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:32,187
Blue team, please prepare to enter the game field

511
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,107
Repeat

512
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,694
The game is about to begin

513
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,035
Where is Director Cui? Why didn’t he come?

514
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,873
I spoke to him on the phone before.

515
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,624
There was an emergency at home.

516
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,002
So sudden?

517
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,379
yes

518
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,839
Maybe he was afraid

519
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,051
He acted tough and yelled

520
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,928
In fact, the most cowardly

521
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,223
That's fine.

522
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,435
He's just a freeloader and drunkard.

523
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,925
Hide it well, mom

524
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,220
I'll hurry up and find you.

525
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,014
I will find you and protect you

526
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,433
Rongzhi

527
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:56,313
Your dad always threatens to kill me when he gets drunk.

528
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,899
But who died first?

529
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,109
It's Dad

530
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,446
So you really think I'm going to die here?

531
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:11,036
I also have a weapon just in case.

532
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,748
So don't worry about me

533
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,292
Do your own thing

534
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:25,050
Survive at all costs
Then let's get out of here together, okay?

535
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,775
Don't lose your words

536
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,708
I will definitely go find you

537
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,345
Depend on…

538
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:38,415
The arrester will enter in two minutes.

539
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,918
Listen up everyone

540
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,588
In order to avoid being discovered, everyone dispersed and looked for an exit.

541
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:49,509
Who finds the exit first?
Just shout it out and tell everyone!

542
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,597
Great idea!
Let’s help each other get out alive!

543
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,894
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out the little tail

544
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:04,942
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out the little tail

545
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:10,530
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out the little tail

546
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:15,202
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out...

547
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,411
Do you want to cooperate?

548
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,996
What?

549
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,835
Do you think they'll let you down easily?

550
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,253
Of course not

551
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,297
They will fight back with all their might

552
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,842
It would be much easier if we attacked together.

553
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:39,518
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out the little tail

554
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,727
Are you okay?

555
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,437
Jinzi Granny Chunxi

556
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,691
Follow me

557
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:51,029
Come out, come out, sooner or later you will find out the little tail

558
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,115
-careful
-good

559
00:49:55,701 --> 00:50:00,414
I'm not going to have a love affair with you.
It can be said to be a "one-night stand"

560
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,754
When you stabbed Thanos

561
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,923
So cool

562
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,009
Come out, come out...

563
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,929
Red team, please enter the game field

564
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,265
Let's join forces

565
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,859
Let’s get started!

566
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,960
It's all your fault

567
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:31,208
