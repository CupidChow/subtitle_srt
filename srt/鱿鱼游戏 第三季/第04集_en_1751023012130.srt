1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,514
What are you doing?

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,351
What do you think? I'm playing games.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,811
Think about it

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,981
If they didn't come
Then it's just the two of us.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:28,736
Next time we vote, we'll choose the cross
Then take the money and leave here

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,280
22.7 billion won per person!

7
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,660
You son of a bitch!

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,997
No. 276 was eliminated

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,415
Now no one can cross the bridge!

10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,877
Game over assholes!

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,590
stop

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,592
What hand?

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,386
Come and help me hold them off!

14
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,013
Come on!

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,433
If you want to die, come here!

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,810
Come on, bastards!

17
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,776
No. 209 was eliminated

18
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,498
Wow, it's getting more and more interesting

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,930
I can't jump anymore, please move forward.

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,808
How to go? He has blocked the road!

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,893
What are you waiting for?

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,605
Just push him away!

23
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,608
Move forward or we'll all die!

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,235
Come on!

25
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,946
Let me pass!

26
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,740
I'll give you half of my bonus!

27
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,202
Then help you block others!

28
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,203
You bastard!

29
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,747
I'm going to kill you

30
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,666
Let go!

31
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,044

32
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,506
No. 442 was eliminated

33
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,052
Turn around and go back?

34
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,096
Yes, go back!

35
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,890
I...I can't do it

36
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,852
Otherwise we will die, go back quickly!

37
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,480
go back!

38
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,405
No. 377 was eliminated

39
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,042
Are you okay?

40
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,136
No. 349 was eliminated

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,392
What to watch?

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,064
I helped you guys.

43
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,090
Please spare me!

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,218
I can't jump anymore!

45
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,678
Then go die.

46
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,766
Get out of the way

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,311
Don't you understand yet?

48
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,689
You and I can swallow all the money!

49
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,609
I just need to push you from behind.

50
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,862
I saved even a penny.

51
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,658
Get out of the way

52
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,039
The rope speeds up! Hurry up!

53
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,713
Cleared No. 100

54
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,051
Clearance No. 336

55
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,495
Hurry and jump!

56
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,090
Chunxi

57
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,889
Let's go, we have to hurry or it will be too late.

58
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,395
So what are you going to do?

59
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,231
Just sit there and wait to die?

60
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,027
I know you're mad at me

61
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,195
Why did you do that?

62
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,742
For money?

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,332
That man saved me and my child.

64
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,300
But you killed her with the knife I gave you

65
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,218
I didn't know at the time, okay?

66
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,765
I didn't know you were together!

67
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
Chunxi

68
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,020
I've been looking for you

69
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,647
I want to protect you and the kids.

70
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,316
I didn't just think about myself

71
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,361
I did that so we could escape and start over.

72
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
Live a happier life, that's why I do that

73
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,242
let's go

74
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,497
We must survive, Chunxi

75
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,625
We have to get out of here with the kids.

76
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,504
I will help you

77
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,311
How can you help me carry it?

78
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,189
Can you do it?

79
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,540
The child is mine

80
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,461
My child has nothing to do with a scum like you.

81
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:06,134
Don't let us see you again, even in a dream

82
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,273
pay close attention!

83
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,861
What the hell?

84
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,746
You stupid idiot

85
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,624
This could have ended here.

86
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
I can't jump anymore

87
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,963
Please get out of the way!

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,426

Who is it?

99
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
Your little friend

100
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,146
Come in

101
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,734
Children, turn around.

102
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:52,739
Children, children, bump into each other

103
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,783
Children, children...

104
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:59,287

Children, let's go!

106
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:08,088
Children, turn around.

107
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,218
Children, children, bump into each other

108

I'll be right there!

112
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,963
Don't be afraid to jump! You can do it!

113
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,008
- hurry up!
- Walk fast

114
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,762
Tell you to go quickly

115
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,431
I'm leaving now

116
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,649
Save me

117
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,820
Help me!

118
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,614
Please

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,367
Help me! Please!

120
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,412

124
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,050
Uncle Cheng, donâ€™t do it!

125
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,720
No, don't come back

126
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,311
Don't be Chunxi

127
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,064
I'll be right there!

128
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,273
Don't give up!

129
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,193
Please stay where you are, uncle

130
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,741
If you don't make it, my child won't make it either.

131
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,329
Tell me...

132
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,707
I must protect my child no matter what.

133
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,966
I'm doing that now

134
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,179
Please help me

135
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,476

game over

Squid Game 3

139

Episode 4: 222

Soldier 18 Outer Area

141
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,922
(No. 11 Jiang Xia)

142
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,217
Soldier 11 Outer Area

143
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,936
(Today's mission outer area)

144
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,273
Soldier 16 Outer Area

145
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,872
Get the pursuit team in place

146
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,434
Follow me

147
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,374
What a brilliant idea to add kids into this

148
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,459
Drama and viewing experience doubled

149
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,044
Just like it

150
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,381
I didn't expect the game to turn out like this

151
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,342
Yeah, but the thing is
What to do with this child now?

152
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,012
Since mom has been eliminated, maybe...

153
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,723
We should also eliminate the children directly

154
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,559
disuse?

155
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:23,731
Wait, anyway, we all witnessed it.
That kid crossed the finish line didn't he?

156
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:28,112
Yes, eliminate one.
It's not fair to the person who crosses the finish line

157
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:34,617
You know, this is your first time.
She is so charming even when she speaks

158
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,454
Listen to me, this kid is not an independent contestant.

159
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,873
It follows number 222

160
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,959
So since No. 222 is eliminated

161
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,503
That child must also be eliminated

162
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,421
If that's the case

163
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,340
Last round should
Let the child follow the mother's actions

164
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,050
If we admit that this child and his mother

165
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,218
Crossing the finish line separately

166
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,221
Then this child is eligible to participate independently

167
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,476
Well, if everyone disagrees,
Why not ask the organizer?

168
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,817
Let this child in the next round
How about playing as player number 222?

169
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,694
Isn't that the child's mother's number?

170
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,903
right

171
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,155
What is your reason?

172
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,950
Soon players will vote on
Should the game continue?

173
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,953
So what will change if this child participates in the competition?

174
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,623
If the child takes over her mother's competition

175
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,835
Voting and gaming will become more interesting

176
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,337
I promise you

177
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,466
Since the organizer is so confident

178
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,467
Let's do this.

179
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,636
Good Agree

180
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,471
I agree

181
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,434
Thanks to her child, No. 222 came back to life

182
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,605
This reversal is more amazing than Jesus' resurrection

183
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,777
Awesome! No. 222 is invincible!

184
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,823
I knew it!
I knew you could do it! I knew it!

185
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
that

186
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,075
Can you count?

187
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,998
Now there are only eight of us left.

188
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,709
What about the prize money?

189
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,880
44.8 billion won divided by eight

190
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,048
That's 5.6 billion won

191
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,259
5.6 billion won?

192
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,928
5.6 billion won

193
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,934
That's enough for me

194
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,146
And you?

195
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,273
I've had enough.

196
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
Except that person he owes 10 billion

197
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,074
5.6 billion should be enough for everyone to pay off their debts.

198
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,787
In that case, the next time we vote we will...

199
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:39,761
Congratulations to everyone for making it through the fifth game.

200
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,850
Now announce the results of this round of games

201
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,357
A total of 16 players were eliminated in the fifth game

202
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,402
There are currently nine players left.

203
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,281
The total amount of prize money accumulated so far is 44.7 billion won

204
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,785
Each participant received 4.96 billion won

205
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,622
How come there are only nine people left?

206
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,706
There should be eight people.

207
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,418
Yes, obviously there are eight people.

208
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:17,757
No. 39, No. 100, No. 125, No. 203

209
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,760
No. 222, No. 333

210
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,055
No. 336, No. 353

211
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,848
and No. 456

212
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,935
Nine players survive

213
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,853
etc.

214
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,231
Number 222?

215
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,565
That girl?

216
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,484
She just died!

217
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,444
Did you all see it?

218
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,572
No. 222 jumped off the bridge!

219
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,659
No. 222

220
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,913
Right over there

221
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,259
What?

222
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,304
You mean that child is number 222?

223
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,807
That's right

224
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,809
no...

225
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,185
Is this reasonable?

226
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,688
A newborn baby
Suddenly became a contestant?

227
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,939
That's right

228
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,776
That child is number 222

229
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,529
So that child

230
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,284
Inherited her dead mother's number and bonus?

231
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,869
Thatâ€™s 4.9 billion won!

232
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,370
That's right

233
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,455
Go to hell!

234
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,499
What the hell is this rule?

235
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,584
That bitch is dead.

236
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,130
Now that she's dead, the money should be ours!

237
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,925
That damn kid didn't do anything.
Why get the bonus?

238
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,509
that is!

239
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,262
That's the money we earned by risking our lives in the game.

240
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,056
But this child appeared out of nowhere
Transformed into a player

241
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,642
Can you split the prize money with us?

242
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,185
Is this reasonable?

243
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,271
What kind of inheritance is this?

244
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,274
What if I die here?

245
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,820
Should the bonus also be given to my children?

246
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,489
My bonus is 700 million less because of that kid?

247
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,490
Is this reasonable?

248
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,410
Absolutely unacceptable!

249
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,703
that is!

250
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,705
Since the mother of the child is dead

251
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,249
Then this child should also be eliminated, right?

252
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,626
Must be eliminated!

253
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,045
Thatâ€™s right!

254
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,713
That child must also be eliminated

255
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,298
We have to kill that kid!

256
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,092
I will never allow this to happen!

257
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,512
That child must die! Must be eliminated!

258
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,849
- Must be eliminated!
- That child must die!

259
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,934
- No! That's bullshit!
- Don't even think about it!

260
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,936
- The child does not meet the entry criteria
- Eliminate that kid!

261
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,938
- The child doesn't even know how to spend money
- Grab the kid!

262
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,191
- Hand over the child!
- That's bullshit!

263
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,277
No. 456 Hand over the child

264
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,488
Give me that kid.

265
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,325
Hand it over or I'll kill you too!

266
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:58,168
From now on, violence between players is prohibited

267
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:04,091
We want to give every player a fair chance

268
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,010
Please cooperate

269
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,770
Congratulations on your advancement to the final round

270
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:21,274
We have prepared a special gift

271
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,905
Name?

272
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,325
Kim Woo-dong

273
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,327
"Kim Woo-dong"?

274
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,709
Resident registration number?

275
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,461
Mr. Choi Woo-suk

276
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,546
yes

277
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:48,552
Don't wink at him and answer my question.

278
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,556
Do you really know the owner of this house?

279
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,600
How many times have I told you that I know him well?

280
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,728
Captain Park is part of a criminal organization!

281
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,730
Isn't the evidence there?

282
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,026
These are the uniforms and masks they wear!

283
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,322
Hello

284
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,411
I've been dealing with gangs and drug cartels for 20 years.

285
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,788
How can a criminal organization wear pink uniforms like this?

286
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,000
And wearing this stupid toy mask?

287
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,751
I am telling the truth!

288
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,755
Those assholes wear masks like this
Bring people to the island

289
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,217
Make them play children's games and then kill them!

290
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,471
Have you seen it with your own eyes?

291
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,681
Well...

292
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,309
I didn't see it with my own eyes

293
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,311
We have been looking for that island.

294
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,939
Once my team finds it
They will notify me

295
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,942
So what about this money?

296
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,405
The money he buried in the jar! That was obviously dirty money!

297
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,409
There are many people here

298
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,453
Especially the elderly don't put their money in the bank.

299
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,539
They hide their money in jars or under mattresses

300
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,584
There's nothing suspicious about this.

301
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,296
- What the hell...
- No wait

302
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,090
Do you see this?

303
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:14,471
This is Captain Park.
The guy next to them is their guy.

304
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,850
He played cards in the subway station to lure victims into the trap.

305
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,145
He looks like an ordinary person
But he's actually a cold-blooded killer.

306
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
That bastard...

307
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,234
Force me to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Take Back One"

308
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,905
Then I shot and killed the man who was like a brother to me.

309
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,997
So who is he?

310
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,750
I just said that he was playing cards at the subway station...

311
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,461
no!

312
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,255
Didn't ask this

313
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:53,051
His name, age, address, occupation, etc.

314
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,430
What are you asking me for?

315
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,435
Isn't this what you police officers do?
All the tax money was given to you in vain?

316
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,106
yes

317
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,692
So I checked your background

318
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,736
To ensure your tax dollars are not wasted

319
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,407
Brother, you have a lot of criminal record.

320
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:20,579
Kidnapping, illegal detention, assault, threats, extortion

321
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,831
Nine counts in total

322
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,377
Now add burglary and animal protection violations

323
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,006
Your criminal record has officially reached double digits.

324
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,174
You shouldn't be checking me.

325
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,135
Go check Captain Park

326
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,514
That guy is extremely suspicious.
Have you checked his identity?

327
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,391
Captain Park Young-gil

328
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,228
Ten years ago, he was fined for illegal gambling.
That's all

329
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:50,775
I never committed any crime again.
Not even a parking ticket.

330
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,914
This is the island where I was shot.

331
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,835
I swam through the underwater cave from the playground
Used up a whole tank of oxygen

332
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,837
Just got here

333
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,633
A tank of oxygen can last about 40 minutes

334
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,261
Even if you count the thrusters you use

335
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,140
I'm sure the island is within a 20 km radius...

336
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,809
Somewhere on this map

337
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,854
From the time they took Mr. Cheng Qixun away to now
It's been five days

338
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,274
We only have one day left before the game ends.

339
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,946
It is impossible to search all these islands in one day.

340
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,532
Start with the most likely island.

341
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,077
Captain, what do you think?

342
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,541
If you ask me...

343
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,378
Not in this area

344
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,754
The water is rushing here

345
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,842
Coast guard patrols Chinese fishing boats

346
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,554
They wouldn't choose a place like this to host a game.

347
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,021
Then we will search this island at dawn.

348
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,693
We will take care of the south and let ship number two search the north.

349
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,778
good

350
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,239
good

351
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,198
That's it.

352
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,282
Hello, Officer Song.

353
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,035
- What's wrong, sir?
- Has Park Young-gil's location been confirmed?

354
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,579
He seems to be working at sea.

355
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,375
You have to call him.
His property was vandalized.

356
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,002
It's too late now
I was planning to call again tomorrow morning.

357
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,880
Fishermen don't sleep at night.

358
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,757
His dog just died.

359
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,592
You should call him and tell him about this.

360
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,594
It's the chief

361
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,305
Officer, I need to make a call too.

362
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,599
Who do you want to call?

363
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,144
My lawyer

364
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,272
Give

365
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,025
No, this won't work. Please give me my phone.

366
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,487
Your phone has been seized as criminal evidence.

367
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,574
If you need to make a phone call, use this

368
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,827
My friend is a lawyer
His number is in my phone.

369
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,537
Give me your phone!

370
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,830
I said no

371
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,584
Hello, is this Captain Park Young-gil?

372
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,209
right

373
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,670
Hello, this is Wujin Police Station

374
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,174
I'm calling to inform you
There has been a burglary at your residence

375
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,510
Someone broke into my house?

376
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,309
We received a call from your neighbor.
The intruder was caught at the scene

377
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,520
That's it. Thank you.

378
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,774
What does the other party want to steal?

379
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:41,237
He wanted to steal the cash and clothing you buried in your front yard.

380
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,535
Could you tell me the name of the intruder?

381
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,246
Okay, his name is Choi Woo-seok.

382
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,956
Man in his 40s

383
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,834
Maybe you know him?

384
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,254
I don't know, I haven't heard of it.

385
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,256
good

386
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:06,054
The problem is this guy keeps talking nonsense.

387
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,889
nonsense?

388
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,265
He said you are

389
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,227
Member of a criminal organization
Specializes in kidnapping people and taking them to an island

390
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,272
Force them to play a deadly game

391
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,858
He also said the money you buried in the yard was dirty money.

392
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,485
And that pink jumpsuit...

393
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,780
Give me your phone now!

394
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,199
My lawyer's number is in my cell phone!

395
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,787
You won't let me get my phone back.
It's a violation of my rights!

396
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:36,291
Is this how the police in a small place like yours handle cases?
Do whatever you want without following the rules?

397
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,127
OK! Then I want to see your director!

398
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,130
A good friend of mine
He's a big shot in Wujin!

399
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,717
I can make you all lose your jobs!

400
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,135
Okay, okay.

401
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,680
Calm down, okay?

402
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,599
I'll let you use your phone

403
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,477
Hurry up and grab it!

404
00:30:56,479 --> 00:31:00,566
Hello, sorry for being a little noisy just now

405
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,650
That's it, Captain Park

406
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,277
Waiting for you to return to the port

407
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,114
Please come to the police station immediately
Check if there are any other losses

408
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,949
in addition

409
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,660
I regret to inform you

410
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,914
Your dog died

411
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,375
It looks like Mr. Choi Woo-seok killed him.

412
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,128
OK, thanks

413
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,304
Who's calling you so late?

414
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,517
Oh, it's someone I worked with before.

415
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,396
He had a nightmare to remind me to be careful

416
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,900
What did he dream about?

417
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,866
His dog died.

418
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,912
In his dream

419
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,748
What's the password?

420
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,542
Of course the password must be kept secret.

421
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,837
I can unlock the face. Hold it up for me.

422
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,965
Let's take a picture of your face

423
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,389
- Hey! Catch him!
- Hello!

424
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,725
Siri called Officer Huang!

425
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,019
Hey! You...

426
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,605
Come in

427
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:25,275
I want to say a few words to Captain Gao of Ship No. 2

428
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,402
good

429
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,788
(Director Choi)

430
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,126
Hello, Director Choi

431
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,634
This is ship number one, ship number two, received, please reply

432
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,595
This is ship number two. Please speak.

433
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,554
We are exposed

434
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,933
Kill everyone on the boat immediately.

435
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,934
receive

436
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,728
Officer Hwang! Captain Park is their man!

437
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:02,896
What?

438
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,190
He's one of the masked men!

439
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,986
I found his uniform and mask at his house!

440
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,872
I also found
His photo with the guy in the picture! Damn!

441
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,543
Be careful, he knows I broke into his house!

442
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,753
Officer Huang! Be careful!

443
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,256
Officer Huang!

444
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,603
Does the captain eat instant noodles?

445
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,481
Prepare one for him

446
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,571
Where's Officer Huang?

447
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,285
Behind you

448
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,968
Who are you?

449
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,554
What do you want to do?

450
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,810
Why did you save me before?

451
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,436
I...

452
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,480
Just follow orders

453
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,441
Whose orders?

454
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:16,197
He told me to keep you alive at all costs.

455
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,332
Do you know where that island is?

456
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,839
Even if you rush over now, what can you do?

457
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,633
Look around you

458
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,095
No one can help you now.

459
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,848
Where is that island?

460
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,814
I should have died anyway.

461
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,901
But the captain gave me a second chance

462
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,237
Where? Tell me now!

463
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,868
Thanks to you

464
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,204
These days are very interesting

465
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,893
Please take a seat, everyone.

466
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,055
We have prepared plenty of food and drinks for you.

467
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,267
If you need more, please let us know

468
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,602
I'm a little worried

469
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,104
What are you worried about?

470
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,024
Although the kid diluted the prize money

471
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,027
But such a large sum of money
Most people would still choose to end the game, right?

472
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,194
Don't worry

473
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,407
The final game will definitely be played

474
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,158
How can you be so sure?

475
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,870
Just make sure you survive.

476
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,913
They have no reason to vote against it.

477
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,540
It seems you already have a plan.

478
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,419
Our hosts always have a plan.

479
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:06,384
Now for a general vote
To decide whether to continue the game

480
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,553
But before voting begins

481
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,350
We'll give you a hint about the final game

482
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,019
In the final game

483
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,191
You can choose the players to be eliminated

484
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,859
What?

485
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,030
We get to decide who gets eliminated?

486
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,365
That's right

487
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,702
If you can reach a consensus
Eliminate three players

488
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,457
The rest of the people can pass smoothly.

489
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,670
That means we only need to eliminate three people.
And we decide the candidates?

490
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,005
That's right

491
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:48,134
In the final game
You just need to eliminate at least three players

492
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,388
You said "at least three players"

493
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,600
Does that mean more than three people can be eliminated?

494
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,310
That's right

495
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,815
But the decision is up to you.

496
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,527
So we can also decide the number of people to be eliminated?

497
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,069
That's right

498
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,529
Oh shit

499
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,074
Could you please put it more simply?
What does it mean exactly?

500
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,992
Let me make it clear

501
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,788
At least three people must be eliminated

502
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:22,377
And we get to decide who to eliminate?

503
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,545
That's right

504
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:29,009
Final game elimination list
It's up to you to decide

505
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,262
If you eliminate three players

506
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,098
The remaining ones will be the final winners

507
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,726
and leave here

508
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,479
Start voting now

509
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,441
Voting order will be in reverse order of player numbers

510
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,445
No. 456 Please vote

511
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,305
Please vote for No. 353

512
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,910
No. 336

513
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,927
No. 333

514
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,681
No. 222

515
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,854
Player 222 is unable to make his own decision

516
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,148
will be deemed as a waiver

517
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,401
Does anyone have any objections?

518
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,570
I...

519
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,489
No objection

520
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,372
Can I have some more rice?

521
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,457
So everyone agrees, right?

522
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,875
- right
- I agree

523
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:11,171
Then vote quickly and enjoy your meal.

524
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,431
No. 125

525
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,565
Hello!

526
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,401
Go vote

527
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,367
No. 100

528
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,427
Last No. 39

529
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,305
Shall we just announce the result now?

530
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,893
Five votes in favor out of nine is a majority.

531
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,021
Do you still need to vote?

532
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,774
No

533
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,319
I was planning to cast a circle anyway.

534
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:06,077
Since five out of nine voted in favor

535
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,539
We're going to the end game

536
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,749
Thank you for your hard work.

537
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,590
Now that we have come this far

538
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:24,804
Let us
Cheers to trying your best to make it to the end

539
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,140
Everyone raise your glasses!

540
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,433
cheers!

541
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,310
- cheers
- cheers

542
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,609
Now enjoy!

543
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,861
Enjoy it everyone

544
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,157
Hey, bring me some barbecued ribs and mixed vegetables!

545
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,616
Bring me some more wine.

546
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,078
Our host was right again.

547
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,998
But I'm still curious
How will they decide who to eliminate?

548
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,125
This probably depends on the rules of the next game.

549
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,004
Sorry, for everyone's enjoyment

550
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,380
We will announce it tomorrow

551
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,300
I can't wait

552
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,385
Why not drink all night?

553
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,140
Wait for the sun to rise and the game begins

554
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,143
where you go?

555
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,060
I'm going to bed.

556
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:17,191
So early? Come and have a drink with me.

557
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,490
Wow, that sounds sexy, what does it mean?

558
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,786
Instead of drinking with you
I might as well drink with my footstool

559
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,096
The second team should have been eliminated as well.

560
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,938
The bleeding stopped

561
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,858
It's a penetrating wound, but I should be fine for now.

562
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,194
- Once we find that island...
- We should give up now.

563
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,072
We still have time

564
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,200
There must be people alive there.

565
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,037
You really just because of this
Want to find that island?

566
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,339
My brother is on that island

567
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,551
If you can't find it now

568
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,929
Maybe there will be no chance anymore.

569
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,682
Help me

570
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:41,441
There is no other ship
We can't possibly search the entire area alone.

571
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,132
Not in this area

572
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,967
The water is rushing here

573
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,722
Coast guard patrols Chinese fishing boats

574
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,976
They wouldn't choose a place like this to host a game.

575
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,899
That island must be here.

576
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,267
This is ship number two. All the people have been dealt with.

577
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,268
Where's ship number one?

578
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,314
Captain Park must have been captured.

579
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,781
Answer No. 11

580
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,493
I have nothing to say

581
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,413
How far do you think you can get in that boat?

582
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,416
It's not too late to turn back now

583
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,502
Bring him back

584
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,547
If you hand him over obediently
I can let you go

585
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,425
Don't look for us from now on.

586
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,553
It's better for you.

587
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,100
No. 246 Park Kyung-seok

588
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,019
I don't know how you know him.

589
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,899
But I might know where he's going.

590
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,321
Room 4104, Pediatric Cancer Ward, Seohyun University Hospital

591
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,156
How about it?

592
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,284
Do you want to come back now?

593
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,483
If you have to choose three people, it's easy.

594
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,944
Don't even think about it

595
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,572
Number 456 over there

596
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,241
The child number 222

597
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:41,746
And that drug addict No. 125

598
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,416
We can eliminate those three.

599
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:51,048
Wait until those three are eliminated
The remaining six of us got along well.

600
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,592
Divide the money and leave here

601
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,596
How much money can each of us get?

602
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,223
It is 7.6 billion won

603
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,855
So we have a deal now.

604
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,274
The six of us are a group

605
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,320
Only eliminate those three people

606
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,281
Then each of them left with 7.6 billion won

607
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,368
But the problem is
We don't know what the end game is yet

608
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,996
They also said that more than three people can be eliminated

609
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:27,667
That's right, but they say the elimination is in our hands.

610
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,879
So no matter what game
We all have the advantage

611
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,673
Okay, stop talking.

612
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,720
If you want to form a team, put your hands up.

613
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,685
Come on, brother, are you joining or not?

614
00:51:53,527 --> 00:52:00,367
Let that kid join the game
It's a good thing for us.

615
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,599
Why do you want to go back?

616
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,309
Full speed ahead to the north

617
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,979
Call the police when you get ashore

618
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,273
Your daughter is in danger

619
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,945
Do you know my daughter Nayeon?

620
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,490
Let's go

621
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,702
Escape as far as possible before the fog clears.

622
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,805
Sir, the ship has run away again.

623
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,395
Kill them both.

624
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,385
No. 456

625
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,847
He wants to see you

626
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,436
Sit down. We need to talk for a while.

627
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,828
I have a suggestion for you.

628
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,709
It's about your and your children's future

629
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,003
us...

630
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,131
Is there a future?

631
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,092
As you would expect

632
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:52,639
Next Game
Others will definitely target you and your child.

633
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,977
Isn't this you?
And what do your customers want to see?

634
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,691
You deliberately
Put a newborn baby into the game

635
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:09,532
Do you want to see people who are driven crazy by money?
Kill this child

636
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:14,329
I want to help you and the child.

637
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,378
Do you want to help us?

638
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,600
Take this knife back to the room

639
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:41,231
Kill all those bastards who want to kill you.

640
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,529
They had eaten and drunk enough and had fallen asleep

641
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:52,242
Even if you slit their throats one by one
No one will notice

642
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,126
Why do you come up with this idea?

643
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,648
Mr. Cheng Qixun

644
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,902
I'm sorry for Zheng Bei's death.

645
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,579
You want to kill me?

646
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,999
Then let's do it

647
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,376
There are only two of us here

648
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,755
No one is stopping you

649
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:52,469
But even if you kill me
Nothing will change

650
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,972
Someone else will replace me

651
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,100
And tomorrow's game will continue

652
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,436
Until then

653
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,732
You still have to face those
The bastard who wants you and your child dead

654
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,964
But if you kill them all now

655
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,218
You and the child will be the only ones left.

656
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,597
If there are only two people left, the next game cannot be played.

657
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,809
Then according to the rules

658
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,479
game

659
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,648
It will end

660
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,779
Then you and your child

661
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,823
You can get out alive

662
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,826
I promise you

663
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,837
They will try to kill you and the baby tomorrow.

664
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,008
You kill them first.

665
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,719
This is

666
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,681
Your current optimal solution

667
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,075
No. 456

668
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,874
Do you still believe in humanity?

669
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:36,836
