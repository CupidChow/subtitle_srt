1
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,262
What are you hesitating about?

2
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:25,311
They will come to kill you tomorrow

3
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,608
Kill those bastards with this knife

4
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,403
This is

5
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,489
Your current optimal solution

6
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,743
Uncle

7
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,669
don't want

8
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,048
Uncle, you...

9
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,051
Not that kind of person

10
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,201
Squid Game 3

11
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:34,125
Episode 5: ○△□

12
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,827
Did you see anything?

13
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,415
The fog is so thick that I can't see anything!

14
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,127
Watch your two points!

15
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,089
There should be some islands over there.

16
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,178
Officer Huang Junhao

17
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,391
Can you hear me?

18
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,898
able

19
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,025
You should give up now.

20
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,115
You should have killed me then.

21
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,494
If you look deeper into this game

22
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,371
You will die.

23
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,415
Then you have to kill me

24
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,415
Please note

25
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,753
The final game is about to begin

26
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:48,259
Please follow the staff's instructions

27
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,471
Repeat...

28
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,087
You came back by yourself?

29
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,634
I clearly asked you to bring him back

30
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,719
sorry

31
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,726
I thought I knew you better than anyone else

32
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,230
If this is true
You should know I won't do what you tell me.

33
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,734
What do you want?

34
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:34,073
Delete all records of No. 246

35
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,120
(No. 246 Park Kyung-seok)

36
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,666
(Do you want to permanently delete this document?)

37
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,752
Is that all?

38
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
right

39
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,216
The records on the master server are also included

40
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,678
I am afraid...

41
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,599
I'm also going to delete the record in your mind

42
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,478
There is another

43
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,148
Paper version

44
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,277
We must completely eliminate the presence of No. 246 here.
You have to destroy it too.

45
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Where?

46
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,494
In the Captain's Archives on the top floor

47
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,998
You know that not everyone can get in.

48
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,959
Besides the captain, I'm the only one who can enter.

49
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,186
Identity confirmation

50
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,147
Please select floor

51
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,483
Take your time

52
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,129
All players

53
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,259
Please go to the elevator in front

54
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,990
(Safety First)

55
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:14,043
Welcome to the End Game

56
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,836
The end game is

57
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,340
Air Squid Game

58
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,658
Why on earth did you do that?

59
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
I've seen the records

60
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,836
You and No. 246 were colleagues before

61
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,965
Do you like him?

62
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,677
If No. 246 dies...

63
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,975
His child died.

64
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,685
His daughter?

65
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,274
So you do all this
All to save other people's children?

66
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,112
This will relieve you
Guilt about abandoning your own children?

67
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,698
Please let him and his daughter go.

68
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
good

69
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,871
I understand you to some extent

70
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,164
But

71
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,917
You've crossed the line

72
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,961
Too far beyond the line

73
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
The reason why I think you are different

74
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,704
Not only because you are from North Korea too.

75
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,881
I thought you were better than anyone here.
They understand me better

76
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,308
Same as you

77
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,603
I also lost the most important person in that land

78
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,023
Just because I can't get a damn kidney

79
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,029
But here organs are readily available

80
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,413
Sir, this is the control room.

81
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,672
Sir, please answer this is the control room

82
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,892
explain

83
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,521
The game is ready and everyone is on standby

84
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,899
start

85
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,818
I'll be there soon

86
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
I misjudged you.

87
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,170
I should have thrown you into the game too.
Just like them

88
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,677
I thought you were different
Because you left your child there.

89
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,231
Stop worrying about other people's children.

90
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,568
You should go to heaven to accompany yourself.

91
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,863
I will let you go without pain

92
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,583
Running again?

93
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,836
Where to run?

94
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,593
You know very well

95
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,430
That elevator doesn't go anywhere.

96
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,725
You need my mask.

97
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,535
The rules of the game are as follows

98
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:05,542
Players will be in the square tower
Play games on triangular and circular towers

99
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,340
Play a push game on each tower

100
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,468
The first round will be held on the square tower where you are now.

101
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:20,348
If more than one player is alive and is pushed down

102
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:25,521
The remaining players will advance to the Triangle Tower for the second round

103
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,856
Similarly, if on the second round of triangle tower

104
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,401
Eliminate more than one player

105
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,780
Then advance to the round tower

106
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,616
The same is true for the final round of the tower

107
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,785
Push down more than one player

108
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,207
The remaining players on the tower are the final winners

109
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,212
Please note

110
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:55,091
If you fail to eliminate anyone within the time limit

111
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,345
All members on the tower will be eliminated

112
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,522
Well, it's clear which three people will be eliminated.

113
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,275
It depends on who comes first and who comes later.

114
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,708
Minxiu

115
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,425
Minxiu

116
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,971
Minxiu

117
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,684
I miss you, brother.

118
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,688
Save Me Min-soo

119
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,233
Do you want pills?

120
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,028
I'll give you

121
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,113
Please!

122
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,455
Got you, jerk.

123
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,123
You son of a bitch!

124
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,668
Hey, give me back the medicine.

125
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,048
Give me back the medicine!

126
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
My Brother Minsu

127
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,677
Min-soo, you can't stand it.

128
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,095
Give me back my medicine, you bastard!

129
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,431
You coward!

130
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,226
My medicine bastard!

131
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,487
What's wrong with him?

132
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,906
Rather than eliminating No. 456...

133
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:48,830
Please press the ground button to start the first round of the game

134
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,098
Game Start

135
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,476
You have 15 minutes.

136
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,936
Okay, listen.

137
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,065
Let's discuss this rationally.

138
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,609
If we push and shove and make a mess

139
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,529
In the end, they might all die, right?

140
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,698
- right
- right

141
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:28,202
Although it's cruel, one person is eliminated in each round

142
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,539
Seems to be the option with the least loss

143
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,623
What do you think?

144
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,167
- good
- You're right.

145
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:40,716
So how do we decide who to eliminate?

146
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,802
That's the problem, right?

147
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,013
Let's vote.

148
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:50,266
We used voting to decide before.
Is the game continuing?

149
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:55,314
So we should vote this time too
Choose who should be eliminated to maintain democracy

150
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,483
Good vote sounds good

151
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,901
I agree

152
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,988
Keeping democracy

153
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,700
Then nominate the people we think should be eliminated.

154
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,702
Discuss and then vote

155
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,787
This is the most democratic way

156
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,664
That makes sense

157
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,168
This person said that he was a teacher outside

158
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,337
Quite cultural indeed!

159
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,254
good

160
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,714
Since there is still enough time

161
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:26,011
Let's nominate the people we think should be eliminated first.

162
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,610
I think the one who should be eliminated the most is No. 222

163
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,154
Can you tell me the reason?

164
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,407
Frankly speaking, No. 222 was already out.

165
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,078
But her child took her place in the game

166
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,954
This is ridiculous.

167
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,291
It's not fair at all

168
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,042
I agree

169
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,962
It's unreasonable for No. 222 to return to the game

170
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,881
not to mention

171
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,842
Children cannot play games independently
No independent voting

172
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,886
Eliminating No. 222 will allow the subsequent games to

173
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:14,058
And the voting process is fairer for everyone

174
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,645
Stop saying those high-sounding words.

175
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:24,361
Even if that little meatball gets out alive

176
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,031
What happens next?

177
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,701
Mom is dead.

178
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,248
He doesn't seem to have a father.

179
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,334
Who will raise this child?

180
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,546
Unfortunately

181
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,465
The child can't survive.

182
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,178
Isn't it?

183
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,649
alright

184
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:08,612
If no one objects, then vote to eliminate No. 222.

185
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,698
etc.

186
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,742
I object

187
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,703
What's your problem?

188
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,205
This game has three rounds

189
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,208
We have to think long term.
Make smarter decisions

190
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,252
Could anything be more sensible than this?

191
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:28,216
I guess 456 will do his best to protect that child.

192
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,802
He might be protecting now.

193
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:37,308
But if we threaten to push him off
He will definitely abandon the child

194
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,059
After all, his own life is more important.

195
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,522
Think carefully about what this person said.

196
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,274
You all saw it

197
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,528
In the rope skipping level, he carried the child across the bridge

198
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,865
I don't know why
But he just wouldn't let go easily

199
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,494
Could it be that madman?

200
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,370
Is he the biological father of the child?

201
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,582
Fuck it

202
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,834
Just push them both down together.

203
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,877
That won't work.

204
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,379
If the six of us want to survive

205
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,382
Only one person can be eliminated per round

206
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,426
Don't you understand?

207
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,013
So how do we separate them?

208
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,767
If you want to push them down one by one
We have to separate them.

209
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,186
I'll figure it out then.

210
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:26,233
This round we can
Choose the easiest target first

211
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,177
You also know that No. 125 is a drug addict

212
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,638
It looks like he's in withdrawal now.

213
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,432
God knows what he will do.

214
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,728
So I suggest eliminating the 125 first.

215
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:08,316
Then find a way to separate No. 456 from the child.

216
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,653
Well, there's not much time left.

217
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,197
Let's vote

218
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:19,452
Please raise your hands if you agree to eliminate No. 125

219
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,123
Six votes passed!

220
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,761
Wow wait a minute

221
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,432
Looks like they changed the order.

222
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,102
etc.

223
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,145
sorry

224
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,648
Wait, yeah... I'm sorry.

225
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,190
sorry

226
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,359
knew

227
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,613
I know you're sorry
Then let go and jump down yourself.

228
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,656
Please forgive me

229
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,117
I'm just scared

230
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,786
I'm just afraid I might die.

231
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,538
- I didn't mean it.
- Listen

232
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,374
We discussed this as a democratic decision.

233
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,126
- Please forgive me this time.
- sorry

234
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,338
But we need you to die.

235
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
Fuck you!

236
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,387
What am I doing wrong?

237
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,182
What's wrong with me?

238
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,187
I'm just trying to survive

239
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,939
I don't know, okay?

240
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,691
I had no idea it would turn out like this!

241
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,860
Oh shit

242
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,987
There's no point in talking nonsense to him!

243
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,989
Just push him down!

244
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,701
Who's coming?

245
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,122
Go push him down.

246
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
I?

247
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,428
etc.

248
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,889
If I go

249
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,017
What if he grabs me?

250
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,398
You bastards...

251
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,528
Who will push him then?

252
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,825
If No. 125 resists desperately
It's not easy to eliminate him.

253
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,828
It's like "belling the cat"

254
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,124
There's no time left.

255
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,751
If we delay any longer we will all die!

256
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,504
Oh shit

257
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,641
Get out of the way

258
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,109
Why are you doing this?
What am I doing wrong?

259
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,279
Why is it always me? What have I done?

260
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,909
sorry

261
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,078
I don't want this either.

262
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,584

264
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,939
I...

265
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,275
sorry

266
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,446
Sorry, Shimei

267
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,031
Come with me

268
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,211
No. 125 eliminated

269
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:46,260
This rod is used for this.

270
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,556
This guy has a pretty sharp mind.

271
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,729
End of first round

272
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,442
Turn to two o'clock

273
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,622
All players please proceed to the next round

274
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,928
Alright ladies and gentlemen.

275
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,182
It's time to eliminate No. 222 and No. 456

276
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,434
They have to separate the two first.

277
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,606
No. 456 is a lunatic, it shouldn't be that easy

278
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,581
Please press the button to start the game

279
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,886
Slow down

280
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,183
It won't be too late to press it after separating him from the child.

281
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,981
That's good

282
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,525
Nominate the players to be eliminated first

283
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,985
Vote now

284
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,112
I nominate No. 222

285
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,447
- Any objections?
- No

286
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,364
No

287
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,993
Then it is decided to eliminate No. 222

288
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,752
I agree

289
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:11,882
Since six out of eight
Agree to eliminate player No. 222

290
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:17,472
Then according to the democratic vote
Player No. 222 will be eliminated

291
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,768
I understand your feelings

292
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,187
I know you can't bear to do that to your child.

293
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,981
I also have two children

294
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,732
That's right

295
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:33,278
We are human beings too and we don't want to do this.

296
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,864
That child has lost his mother.

297
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,450
Let the child leave here without any pain

298
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,286
Maybe it's a relief.

299
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,704
Don’t you think so?

300
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,791
Sir, we won't let you do it yourself.

301
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,252
Just hang the kid on the pole, please.

302
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,173
We will send our children to a better place.

303
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,677
You can turn your head away.

304
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,434
If you don't hand over the child
I might push you both off.

305
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,982
What happens if you kill us both?

306
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,403
Who will you kill next round?

307
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,366
How are you going to draw lots?

308
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,743
Or...

309
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,705
Pick a weakling?

310
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,834
Game Start

311
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,255
You have 15 minutes.

312
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,258
What did you do? We're still talking to him!

313
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,053
I don't give a fuck.

314
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,890
If he refuses to abandon the child
Then push them both down.

315
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,403
Come if you have the ability.

316
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
But don't forget

317
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,741
You might be next

318
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,536
They seem to be plotting against you behind your back.

319
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,789
So what? What do we do?

320
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,089
What are you waiting for? Just push them down!

321
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,601
What are you doing?

322
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,144
Think about it again

323
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,479
What's there to think about?

324
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,941
If you don't dare, I'll do it.

325
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,693
How many times do I have to say it?

326
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,570
If you solve both of them

327
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,073
The next round will be one of ours.

328
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,701
Don't use your brain like a fool!

329
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,913
You called me an idiot?
I'll kill you first, you bastard.

330
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,956
Stop it!

331
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,626
We shouldn't kill each other!

332
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,877
Everyone calm down, okay?

333
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,504
We agreed to unite till the end

334
00:36:56,505 --> 00:37:00,801
Yes, there is still time for us to discuss it.

335
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,013
Stop talking nonsense!

336
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,015
That asshole was just bluffing.

337
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,310
As long as we really force him

338
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,729
He will abandon the child!

339
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,565
How can you be so sure?

340
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,861
I have an idea

00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,063
This is just a safety measure, don't overthink it

373
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,692
We just discussed it.
Found a way

374
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,030
I believe you will agree

375
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,491
What solution?

376
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,452
We decided to draw lots

377
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,578
Eight people draw lots together

378
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:27,293
Decide who will be eliminated in this round and the next round

379
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,963
The signature is ready

380
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,676
The one who draws the shortest one is eliminated.

381
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,426
right

382
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:39,723
If you are not sure, you can decide the order of the draw.

383
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,225
Yes, no problem

384
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,476
I agree

385
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,937
Did you hear that?

386
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,730
What do you think?

387
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,233
What about the children?

388
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,736
You can help your child draw one

389
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,614
This is always okay, right?

390
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,620
Good trip

391
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,665
Then please come over

392
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,794
Let's draw lots

393
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,546
no

394
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,591
Bring the sign.

395
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,802
Why don't you believe us?

396
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,345
Don't believe

397
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,391
Bring me the lot. I want to draw it here.

398
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,274
Give me the sign

399
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
Good trip

400
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,700
Wait, let me count again.

401
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,098
Please forgive me

402
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,308
They forced me to do it.

403
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,728
They threatened to kill me if I refused.

404
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,897
Please forgive me

405
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,982
I have a wife and children outside

406
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,069
I just want to survive

407
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,072
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

408
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,368
Please, spare me.

409
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,911
- Push him!
- Get started!

410
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,913
Get out of the way!

411
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,049
No. 336 was eliminated

412
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm on your side

413
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,648
Wow, their alliance didn't last long.

414
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,484
Promises and covenants are never reliable

415
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,409
Okay! Everyone calm down.

416
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,953
Someone has been eliminated, we can continue

417
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,788
There's no need to kill each other anymore.

418
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,792
Go straight to the next round of the game

419
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,921
Only one round left

420
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,258
Don't be stupid and swing the knife

421
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,428
Think about it calmly, okay?

422
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,098
This is the last round.

423
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,059
So we really should draw lots this time.

424
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,227
What do you think?

425
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,063
I...I agree

426
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,859
Look, the signature is ready.

427
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,615
Those who support the lottery raise their hands

428
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,994
Four is better than three

429
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:33,999
We draw lots by majority vote

430
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,626
Fairness and Justice

431
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,463
Isn’t this exactly what we want?

432
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,673
no

433
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,052
There are four of them and two of us.

434
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,930
They may betray us at any time.

435
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,722
Betray you?

436
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,224
You still have the nerve to say that?

437
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,142
You betrayed us!

438
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,103
It was you who suggested tying us together.
Take the child away!

439
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,023
This was all his idea.

440
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:02,778
Young people nowadays only care about money
Can't believe it at all!

441
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,240
I just want to save this child.

442
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,160
This is...

443
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,623
My child

444
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,171
Who could have thought of this?

445
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,674
No. 333 is actually the father of the child?

446
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,928
In other words, in this game, parents and children

447
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,889
All have good guys...

448
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,853
And in the last round there was also that old woman and her son

449
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,566
It's like watching a family reality show.

450
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,818
Have to say

451
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,530
The lineup of players this time is really exciting

452
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:52,119
I still think that we should bring No. 456 back to participate in the game
This is the best decision

453
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,542
Are you the child's father?

454
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,461
No... Impossible

455
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,549
But you still want to kill the child first?

456
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,929
Sir, you don't really believe him, do you?

457
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,392
Why do you think I
Push down another person instead of you, uncle?

458
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,770
So why are you switching sides now?

459
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,024
I wanted to leave here with Chunxi

460
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,486
But she doesn't trust me

461
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,249
We have weapons.

462
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,419
If we join forces now

463
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,088
They can't deal with us.

464
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,634
In fact, we can also decide who to eliminate

465
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,308
You must believe me

466
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,395
I really want to protect my children.

467
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,947
Okay, it's ok, come here

468
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,906
- What happened?
- Control him

469
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,284
- What are you doing?
- Hold on to him

470
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,214
Okay, look!

471
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,009
I have found the solution to the game

472
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,970
Let's pack a lunch box!

473
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,348
Beat him into a meat pie

474
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,226
Drag to the round tower

475
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,104
Press the start button and throw him down!

476
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,481
That's it, the game is over!

477
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,399
The five of us...

478
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,068
Six people plus children

479
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:53,239
The six of us split the prize money and walked away with nothing.

480
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,949
7.6 billion won per person!

481
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,284
how?

482
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,204
How about this solution?

483
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,251
"convenient"?

484
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,045
This is a brilliant idea.

485
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,803
Please...

486
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,807
Please...please save me

487
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,811
This guy is really tough.

488
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,188
Grab his legs

489
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,443
Good, good, hold on tight!

490
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,953
alright

491
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,455
convenient!

492
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,166
All set

493
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,879
Now all that's left is to carry him over.

494
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,967
Get out of the way

495
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,973
Any questions sir?

496
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,565
This isn't a solution

497
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,526
So what do you want?

498
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,323
We draw lots

499
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,367
just

500
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,578
fair

501
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,916
Not counting children

502
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,794
Oh my god.

503
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,711
This is too ridiculous.

504
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,588
This is how the game could end

505
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,424
Why are you doing this?

506
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,259
Number 333!

507
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,429
Do you agree with this lunatic?

508
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,432
Is this reasonable?

509
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,297
You! Go to hell!

510
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,479
Let go asshole!

511
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,329
etc!

512
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,874
Please spare me!

513
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,429
Beautiful, you two! You did the right thing!

514
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,935
These bastards should have died long ago!

515
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,022
Well, now there are only five of us left.

516
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,941
Let me take a look

517
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,651
For this bento!

518
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,239
Next round we drag him over and throw him down

519
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,865
The three of us...

520
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,618
Not the four of us including the child

521
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,744
Let me calculate.

522
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,165
One person... takes 11.4 billion won!

523
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,629
Wouldn't everyone be happy with so much money?

524
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,386
11.4 billion won is not enough for you?

525
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,556
I just need 10 billion won

526
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,892
That's good!

527
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,602
I'll give you 1.4 billion won!

528
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,065
You can split the money...

529
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,235
You can share equally. You can...

530
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,656
Each of us can get 15.2 billion won

531
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,076
As long as you die

532
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,879
No. 100 is eliminated

533
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,641
End of the second round

534
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,958
sorry

535
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,961
But I don't want to be your lunch box

536
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,882
Wait! Calm down.

537
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,804
We didn't think so, did we?

538
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,602
You stay where you are

539
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,854
Let's talk

540
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,899
You guys chat by yourselves.

541
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,986
I quit

542
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,447
No!

543
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,039
No. 39 was eliminated

544
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:23,476
