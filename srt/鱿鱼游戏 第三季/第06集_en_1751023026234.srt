1
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,987
etc.

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,740
I'm not in the same group with them.

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,120
I want to escape from them

4
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,671
I'll check it out. Don't move.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,929
(Scan No. 246 completed)

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,600
Which games did you participate in?

7
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
right

8
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,481
I escaped from there

9
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,109
Where is that island?

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,826
There

11
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,845
Squid Game 3

12
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,977
Episode 6: Human Nature

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,824
Is the child okay?

14
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,421
All players please proceed to the next round

15
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,470
Hand the child over

16
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,516
You stay where you are

17
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,854
What is he doing?

18
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,691
Did You Know...

19
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,029
What is the result of doing this?

20
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,573
If so

21
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:24,871
In the next round, you and your child will eliminate one person.

22
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,082
I know

23
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,794
Don't tell me...

24
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,010
You're going to kill this child...

25
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,723
Then take the money and leave here

26
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,685
Give me the child

27
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,774
The bridge will be retracted in five minutes.

28
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,404
All players please proceed to the next round within five minutes

29
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,704
It seems that No. 333 has found a way to win this game.
The safest and most appropriate way to play

30
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,331
- No. 456 is difficult to choose
- Please

31
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,874
Protect the kids and my money lunatic!

32
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,335
We are in trouble

33
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,559
(No. 246 Park Kyung-seok)

34
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,661
Four minutes left

35
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,915
I said give me the baby!

36
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,516
If we don't go...

37
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,812
You will die too.

38
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,692
Then let's die here together.

39
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,534
Location?

40
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,080
One kilometer north of here

41
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,249
The radar shows that the enemy is approaching slowly.

42
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,639
I contacted the Coast Guard.

43
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,518
I told you our location
They'll be here in about two hours.

44
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,311
Thanks

45
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,491
Can you do it yourself?

46
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,328
When the Coast Guard arrived
Tell them the whole truth

47
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,123
I will take full responsibility after this is over.

48
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,127
Don't worry about that. Just do what you have to do.

49
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,636
Give me the child now!

50
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,143
you can...

51
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,731
Eliminate me

52
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
Fuck you!

53
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,870
Do you think I'm stupid?

54
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,580
You just want to come over

55
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,167
So that he can push me down and take all the money

56
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,337
You said you won the last one

57
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,132
You are really capable.

58
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,968
I almost fell for your little trick.

59
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,761
Believe me

60
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,931
Fuck you!

61
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,185
Do you know how I ended up in this hellish place?

62
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,521
I was tricked by a bastard like you!

63
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:06,401
You have to believe me
To save yourself and this child.

64
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,487
Why? Who do you think you are?

65
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,697
I swore

66
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,075
I swear...

67
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,578
To protect this child

68
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,788
Did you swear?

69
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,917
With whom? Chunxi?

70
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,255
What's going on between you and her?

71
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,841
Did you know her before you came here?

72
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,764
Is there something going on here for you?

73
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,643
Damn

74
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,021
No wonder she won't leave you.

75
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,273
I felt something was wrong from the beginning!

76
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,068
Wake up and listen to me!

77
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,236
No time

78
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,907
Then stop talking nonsense and put the child down!

79
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,888
(No. 11 Jiang Xia)

80
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,531
hurry up!

81
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,094
Back

82
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,770
Back off again!

83
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,111
Back off again!

84
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,246
(Details: Defected from North Korea alone in 2017)

85
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,541
(Soon after defecting)

86
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,130
(Working part-time as a cartoon character in Seoul Land)

87
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,761
(Jiang Xia and her husband and daughter)

88
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,055
(Husband was executed...)

89
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,308
(The daughter has died...)

90
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,815
Didn't you say you were willing to sacrifice yourself?

91
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,525
Changing your mind so quickly?

92
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,111
You don't deserve it

93
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,129
Please press the button to start the game

94
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,400
Don't come over here!

95
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,325
One step further...

96
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,539
I'll throw the kid out!

97
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,708
don't want

98
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,461
Don't do this

99
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,297
You think I can't do it?

100
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,766
I really throw it!

101
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,233
I really throw it!

102
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
Throw the knife over here

103
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
Back

104
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,748
Back off again!

105
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,493
No. 333 was eliminated

106
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,763
Someone climbed up.

107
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,724
It is No. 456

108
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,857
No one ever wins twice, right?

109
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,825
It's the Coast Guard

110
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,599
Final Game Begins

111
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,102
You have ten minutes.

112
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,822
No.456 What are you waiting for?

113
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,616
Just end the game

114
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,077
I understand

115
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,788
Some goodbyes take time

116
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,654
We are not animals.

117
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,536
We are human

118
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,213
people...

119
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,773
No. 456 was eliminated

120
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,008
game over

121
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,679
The Coast Guard is approaching the island

122
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,098
Start evacuating

123
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,439
All Personnel

124
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,858
Please stop what you are doing.

125
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,112
Gather at the evacuation point immediately

126
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,365
Repeat

127
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,242
All Personnel

128
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,870
Please stop what you are doing.

129
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,874
Gather at the evacuation point immediately

130
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:30,552
(game over)

131
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,090
Identity confirmation

132
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,915
elder brother!

133
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,710
Why?

134
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,630
Why would you do such a thing?

135
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,553
elder brother!

136
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,217
ten

137
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,135
Nine

138
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,094
eight

139
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,137
seven

140
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,138
six

141
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,139
five

142
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,182
Four

143
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,099
three

144
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
two

145
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,311
one

146
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,714
(Six months later)

147
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,411
Can I ask you a question?

148
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,207
Do you live in Fengtiandong?

149
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,710
no

150
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,255
Have I ever painted your portrait here before?

151
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
No

152
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,092
Why do you ask?

153
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,180
I always feel like I've seen you somewhere

154
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,645
Ouch

155
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,648
I'm just asking, nothing else.

156
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,401
I worked here for a while.

157
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,737
That’s what I told you!

158
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,115
No wonder you look familiar

159
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,118
dad!

160
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,870
I'm back

161
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,248
I just took a photo with Tutu

162
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,044
Show me this is a great shot!

163
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,923
Hello Nayeon

164
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,676
Hello

165
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,472
Do you know my daughter?

166
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,435
I heard about her situation when I worked here

167
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,979
I see

168
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,316
She looks healthy now.

169
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,442
yes

170
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,322
Thanks to everyone's help, she is doing much better now.

171
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,624
Thanks

172
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,753
Don't get sick anymore

173
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,546
good

174
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,762
etc.

175
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,431
Your portrait is not finished yet.

176
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,101
I'll come again next time

177
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,358
dad

178
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,360
Could you open it for me?

179
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,487
Of course, baby.

180
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,614
Give

181
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,244
- Is it tasty?
- tasty

182
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,462
- Hello?
- It's me

183
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,214
Why did you change your number?

184
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,301
It's not easy to find you

185
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,470
Who are you?

186
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,765
Have you forgotten my voice?

187
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,476
It's really sad to hear that.

188
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,063
It's Park Wan-cheol from my show "Southern Man and Northern Woman"

189
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,275
The person who has been helping you find your daughter

190
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,238
Don't get excited

191
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,826
But some people say they may have seen her in China

192
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,203
Not sure yet

193
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,290
But many details are correct

194
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,793
Her name is Han Songyi, right?

195
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,759
Did Xiaoxia hear that?

196
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,889
(Wujin Prison)

197
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,979
- dad!
- This way

198
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,823
Qingze!

199
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,160
- Take care of yourself
- Good to keep in touch

200
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,371
Director Cui

201
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,082
Officer Huang!

202
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,177
It's delicious. Where did you buy it?

203
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:02,057
From a kind old lady
Brought to you by the famous tofu shop

204
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,644
Hey, what do you think
Does this make up for what you did?

205
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,647
I asked you to keep watch but you fell asleep

206
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,606
sorry

207
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,067
This world is so unfair.

208
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,570
You're sleepy, but I'm in jail.

209
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,197
I'm really sorry.

210
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,990
But let’s be clear

211
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,700
You're in jail for something you did.

212
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,743
Little bastard

213
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,203
Okay, Director Choi.

214
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,664
I really made you suffer.

215
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,126
You look pretty good.

216
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,169
Yeah?

217
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,172
It's only half a year, just take a short vacation

218
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,424
Prisons have changed a lot in recent years

219
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,927
Better than many small hotels nowadays

220
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,805
The food isn't too bad.

221
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,974
What’s next?

222
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,018
have no idea

223
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,271
I spent so many years looking for that guy who played the picture cards.

224
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,773
Now it's all over

225
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,899
I'm a little confused

226
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,485
I don't know what to do next

227
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,407
What about you, Officer Huang? Are you returning to the police force?

228
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,867
Police force?

229
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,286
After all the chaos?

230
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,122
Forget it

231
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,082
So you wanna team up with me?

232
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,669
Come to think of it, the money lending business isn't that bad.

233
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,756
Helping others in emergencies and making money

234
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,550
This is not right.

235
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,427
You're not helping anyone at all.

236
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,887
You little bastard...

237
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,640
Do you have enough money to lend?

238
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,893
Ouch

239
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,353
If only we still had that money...

240
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,026
Is it true that all the cash in the motel is gone?

241
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,113
Yes, the room was empty when I went there.

242
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,076
Who took it?
No one knows about this money except us.

243
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,330
etc.

244
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,250
Could it be Mr. Cheng...

245
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,006
I hope so.

253
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,439
She's here

254
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,649
This way!

255
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,531
Welcome, Xiaoxiao, thank you for your hard work.

256
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,541
What is Zheer doing?

257
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,169
Say hello

258
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,429
Xiaozhe

259
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,183
They've grown so big.

260
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,647
sorry

261
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,358
I...

262
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,362
It took a long time to get here.

263
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,300
Thank you for all your hard work.

264
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,678
You have worked hard too

265
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,805
This is the file

266
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,694
Thanks

267
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,242
Hello

268
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,078
You are taking T'way Air flight 215

269
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,164
We will fly to Yanji, China at 2:30 pm, right?

270
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,249
right

271
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,626
Your boarding gate is 25

272
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,796
Check-in time is 30 minutes before departure

273
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,223
Hello?

274
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,809
It's Park Wan-cheol from my show "Southern Man and Northern Woman"

275
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,020
Xiaoxia, are you going to fly today?

276
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,606
Yes, I'm at the airport now.

277
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,858
So that's it

278
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,067
I'm sorry.

279
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,904
I wanted to see you off but I was too busy at work.

280
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:35,033
When you get there, someone will pick you up at the airport.

281
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,243
don’t worry

282
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,329
good

283
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,247
Have a safe journey

284
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,501
If you need anything, remember to call me

285
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,628
OK

286
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,673
You must come back with your children.

287
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
Thanks

288
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,390
T'way Air flight boarding announcement begins...

289
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,107
How is it? Pretty good, right?

290
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,985
(Pink Motel)

291
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,654
Let's fix this place up.

292
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,449
Make it like a Las Vegas hotel

293
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,991
Believe me

294
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,452
There are a lot of bars and KTVs around

295
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,079
Business is definitely booming

296
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Follow me

297
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,832
But the renovation will cost a lot of money.

298
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,710
You can save a lot if you do it yourself

299
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,170
Can you paint?

300
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,839
I am a professional wallpaper installer.

301
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,299
marvelous

302
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,052
I learned these skills
To make a living in my hometown

303
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,346
Then you can decorate this place and help me run it.

304
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,515
I'll make you the manager.

305
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,849
- Really?
- right

306
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,561
How many people do you plan to hire?

307
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,605
No one else
I'm the boss and you're the manager. That's it.

308
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,940
What?

309
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:52,444
Come in, this is the room.

310
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,737
This is it?

311
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,365
That's right

312
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,701
Was this originally full of cash?

313
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,785
That's right

314
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,205
No matter who took the light
That person also deleted all the surveillance videos.

315
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,415
Really

316
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,585
Maybe the policeman?

317
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,087
Maybe he stole the money and didn't tell anyone

318
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,923
- Officer Huang?
- right

319
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,219
Impossible. I knew it when I saw him like that.

320
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,930
He doesn't have the guts to steal such a large sum of money.

321
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:25,935
But you said that besides Mr. Cheng
Only you two know

322
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,186
The existence of this money

323
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,230
yes

324
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,734
Who took it?

325
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:40,284
(Los Angeles, USA)

326
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,970
The pizza must have arrived so I can go get it!

327
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,813
Does Cheng Jiaying live here?

328
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,276
I am

329
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,237
Who are you?

330
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,324
An acquaintance of Mr. Cheng Qixun

331
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,788
I'll bring you something.

332
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,712
Jenny, it's your turn soon!

333
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,757
Coming soon

334
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,558
Is this a gift from my dad?

335
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,816
He asked you to give this to me.
Just to see how I'm doing?

336
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,653
You can tell him

337
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,699
I don't care if he contacts me anymore

338
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:06,495
I'll just pretend he doesn't exist
He doesn't have to contact me anymore.

339
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,833
These are Mr. Cheng Qixun's personal belongings.

340
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,340
Mr. Cheng has passed away

341
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,141
This is Jiaying, the one he left for you.

342
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,998
Oh my god!

343
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,724
I rely on

344
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,769
Damn

345
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,366
Okay, one more time.

346
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,702
As you wish

347
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,751
What a bastard!

348
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,607
I rely on

349
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:21,471
