12
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,079
<i>How come I never realized
that you are a woman?</i>

13
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:41,756
<i>I only had eyes for you
and wanted you from the outset.</i>

14
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,608
Goodness.

15
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,028
Why are you running away
when you are here to see me?

16
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:05,071
Here.

17
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,490
Oh, that is cold!

18
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,096
<i>I finally understand…</i>

19
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:17,727
<i>why my heart was torn into pieces</i>

20
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:24,192
<i>after sending you to your death.</i>

21
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,325
Return this stone…

22
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:36,204
to its original spot.

23
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,338
Convey these words to Mongwoo.

24
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,134
"There is absolutely no meaning…

25
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,221
behind saving you."

26
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,933
"Our bond

27
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:58,893
has been severed

28
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,356
and my regrets have faded away.

29
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:08,903
I wish you a peaceful life."

30
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,660
Go this instant.

31
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:19,122
What do you mean Mongwoo disappeared?

32
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,707
After Courtesan Hongjang died,

33
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,335
he ran away in shock,
only to end up falling off a cliff.

34
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:24,753
However, his whereabouts are unclear.

35
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:27,714
According to the patrolmen,

36
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,300
a tiger probably took him.

37
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:31,384
Shut your mouth.

38
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:36,848
That cannot be.

39
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,187
Order the men
to find Mongwoo this instant.

40
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,230
Respectfully,

41
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,608
I have already searched
the cliff he fell from

42
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:48,360
and even every corner of the area.

43
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,612
Yet, I still could not
find a trace of him.

44
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,282
It is for certain

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,242
that Mongwoo has died.

46
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,916
No…

47
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:30,860
Your Majesty.

48
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:32,946
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,116
Do not touch me.

50
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,748
I truly do not understand, Your Majesty.

51
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,460
What could he have meant to you
for you to suffer so?

52
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:51,673
He…

53
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,804
was my left-hand man.

54
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:07,021
My left hand that I had to cut off
to ascend to the throne.

55
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:10,817
You should be careful too.

56
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,071
You never know
when I might cut off my remaining hand.

57
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:57,906
Back then,

58
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,243
the royal physician

59
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,704
who claimed to have treated the wound
on your back was lying.

60
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,294
I would have gotten caught
if I were treated.

61
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:15,465
And as getting caught
would only lead to death,

62
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,592
I desperately pleaded with him.

63
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,094
If you are intending to punish him,

64
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,805
please punish me instead.

65
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,788
You have deceived me on all counts.

66
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,171
Was there any truth

67
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,175
to your words to me so far?

68
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,515
If you order me to answer,

69
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,476
I shall do so, Your Majesty.

70
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:11,479
I will not…

71
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,818
ask any questions of you.

72
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,906
I will not ask what your real name is,

73
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:28,288
why you are disguising yourself as a man,

74
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,915
or what you have done
and where you have been…

75
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,044
for the past three years

76
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:40,508
to finally return before my eyes
to drive me into madness.

77
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,643
Since long ago,

78
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,731
without my conscious knowledge,

79
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:58,985
I have fallen in love with you,

80
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,863
and you have felt the same way.

81
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:11,998
For now, this is enough.

82
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,871
<i>I will not bed you…</i>

83
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,542
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

84
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:58,628
Your Majesty.

85
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,838
You cannot be crueler than this.

86
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,759
How could you ask me
to endure such indignity?

87
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,594
I, too, am enduring one.

88
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:11,432
You must endure as well.

89
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,061
<i>That is a royal command.</i>

90
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,465
<i>My lord.</i>

91
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,675
<i>A letter arrived from the palace.</i>

92
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,688
<i>His Majesty did not bed
Senior Court Lady Dong</i>

93
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,607
<i>and left the palace instead.</i>

94
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:52,283
I thought he would at least
pretend to bed her.

95
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:00,082
His Majesty's affection
for the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

96
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,876
must run deeper than we expected.

97
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,470
This consummation
was clearly set out to fail.

98
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,306
As the court forced this on him,

99
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,558
it was only natural
for His Majesty to run away.

100
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,227
The court did insist,

101
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,729
but it was Her Royal Highness's wish.

102
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:22,813
So what?

103
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,274
Would you take your life
should she insist?

104
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,237
Great Lord!

105
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,948
Please do mind your tone
to the Chief State Councilor!

106
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,616
I am holding back.

107
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,576
Do you really want to see the worst?

108
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,661
Great Lord.

109
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,125
The Border Defense Council
has gathered here

110
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,045
to discuss important state matters
on His Majesty's behalf.

111
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:49,048
If you cannot keep your temper
under control, go home and rest.

112
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:50,550
I apologize, Lord Park.

113
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,637
I was over the line.

114
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,812
It has been over a month

115
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:05,398
since we have received word
that the Qing's envoy

116
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:07,900
has reached Paju.

117
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,696
They are inspecting various areas
under the pretense of sightseeing.

118
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,825
A recent report requested
an immediate dispatch of an envoy escort,

119
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,868
citing financial burden

120
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,039
as the envoy's party spends at least
1,000 <i>nyang </i>in silver for each feast.

121
00:13:22,707 --> 00:13:24,166
An envoy escort?

122
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,168
If we send a nobody,

123
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,421
they may feign dissatisfaction

124
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:30,715
and threaten to return to the Qing.

125
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:33,259
Podan, the chief envoy,

126
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,053
is not the type
to cause trouble without reason.

127
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:37,555
However,

128
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,891
Jung Je-pyo, the vice envoy, is different.

129
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:42,184
Then who do you suggest

130
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,937
to send as an envoy escort?

131
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:55,906
Why are you all looking at me?

132
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,658
The title may sound grand,

133
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,785
but the post only exists
to serve Jung Je-pyo.

134
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,038
Now that he has been
promoted to vice envoy,

135
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,414
he will expect more compensation.

136
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:06,876
I am sick and tired of pouring money
into a bottomless pit.

137
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,462
I will have you know
that my fortune is not unlimited.

138
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:12,798
If you refuse, we will not force you.

139
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:15,885
There are many others
who are willing to supply funds.

140
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,263
Is that so?

141
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:23,434
The Royal Treasury's funds cannot be used
without His Majesty's permission.

142
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:24,894
Who in their right mind

143
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:27,897
would bear such a huge expense
other than me?

144
00:14:28,397 --> 00:14:29,398
Let him in.

145
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,874
Podan carries a letter declaring
the Emperor's ascent to the throne.

146
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,001
The envoy escort
should at least be a full minister!

147
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,962
The Third Minister of Rites is too lowly!

148
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:54,006
Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo and I

149
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,052
are old acquaintances who get along well.

150
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,348
I am confident that I can escort them
to the capital in a few days.

151
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,725
Please entrust me with this task.

152
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,897
Those of you who are against sending him,

153
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,815
raise your hands.

154
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:20,616
Except for one vote,
we are all in agreement

155
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,369
to send Yoo Hyun-bo as the envoy escort.

156
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,501
His Majesty will not approve of this.

157
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,004
I shall secure his approval,

158
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:34,171
so you need not worry.

159
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:38,592
I will not forget
the generosity and the trust

160
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:40,720
you have shown me today.

161
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,968
Is anyone outside?

162
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,139
Have you woken up, Your Majesty?

163
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,891
I will return to the palace.

164
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,809
Get ready.

165
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

166
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:49,807
Sang-hwa, you will remain here

167
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,143
and convey my command
when the <i>gidaeryeong </i>awakes.

168
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,853
Please speak.

169
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:57,898
"As you evaded my men
and intoxicated yourself last night,

170
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:01,026
thereby abandoning your duties,
your crime is grave."

171
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:03,946
"You are not to come to the palace
for the time being

172
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,158
and to await my orders
while confined to your lodgings."

173
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,120
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will convey your command.

174
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,291
That cannot be
for your father's court robe.

175
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,751
Why are you embroidering it?

176
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:43,003
This is for Hongjang.

177
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,340
She has taken good care of me,

178
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,759
but I have never returned her kindness.

179
00:19:58,602 --> 00:19:59,687
<i>My lady.</i>

180
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,647
<i>Your father is home.</i>

181
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,433
Father.

182
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:39,768
<i>Hee-soo.</i>

183
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:44,273
Is it that you dislike marriage
or Kim Myung-ha?

184
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,067
I will get married.

185
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,569
When I find the right man, that is.

186
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,863
You mean someone
who can beat you at <i>baduk</i>?

187
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,907
What if he is a white-haired sage?

188
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,243
If that is my fate,

189
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,038
I must accept it.

190
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,877
Well, that is troublesome.

191
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,431
I am traveling under a royal command.

192
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,392
As a criminal.

193
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:24,605
I will return safely

194
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:27,649
like I always have.

195
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,320
Father…

196
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:33,864
My dear.

197
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,370
You must also

198
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,206
stay safe and sound.

199
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,250
Do you understand?

200
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:39,513
You look as if you have seen a ghost.

201
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:50,774
When one encounters the fearsome captain
of the Special Firearms Unit,

202
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:53,360
anyone would be surprised.

203
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:56,947
I have a royal command for you.

204
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:02,578
Please speak.

205
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:05,080
You are not to come to the palace

206
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,748
and stay confined to your lodgings.

207
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,838
If I am to stay confined,
that means he has given me a punishment.

208
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:15,340
May I ask the reason?

209
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:18,468
The crime of neglecting your duties
due to intoxication.

210
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,516
An incident like last night
cannot reoccur.

211
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:28,395
While serving your penalty,
you are not to leave the premises.

212
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:29,313
Do you understand me?

213
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,443
I shall do as you say.

214
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,784
My lady!

215
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:44,745
My lady!

216
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:46,705
Goodness.

217
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,417
Gosh, you startled me.
My heart almost skipped a beat.

218
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,835
Is Lady Hee-soo not here?

219
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:55,172
She did not stay with you last night?

220
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:56,632
What are you saying?

221
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,467
Lady Hee-soo stayed out last night?

222
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:03,096
What if she was taken
by the patrol troops overnight?

223
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,266
If that were the case,
she would have sent word in the morning.

224
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,227
I guess she would have.

225
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,938
This is the first time she has disappeared
since three years ago.

226
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,857
Wait, where is Master Chu?

227
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:17,653
He left upon <i>paru</i> to see Master Choam.

228
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:18,695
PARU: THE CURFEW LIFT BELL

229
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,073
I will go wait outside the palace
just in case.

230
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:23,742
- What in the world…
- My goodness.

231
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:24,993
My la…

232
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:31,333
- My lord!
- Gosh, my lord!

233
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:34,002
Goodness, my lord.

234
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:36,004
We were worried sick about you.

235
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,924
Where have you been all night?

236
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:41,635
I apologize for worrying you.

237
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:43,303
Things happened.

238
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:45,889
You should come in and rest.

239
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:49,851
I will prepare breakfast.

240
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:51,144
- Go ahead.
- All right.

241
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,146
My goodness.

242
00:24:53,897 --> 00:24:55,774
I will leave you to rest, my lord.

243
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,611
Goodness.

244
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,540
Are you so bent on being the death of me?

245
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,209
Seriously, are you doing this
to drive me crazy?

246
00:25:18,046 --> 00:25:20,299
It does not seem like
you spent the night outside.

247
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,759
Tell me, where did you spend the night?

248
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,482
My lady, this is…

249
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,360
I went to my house.

250
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:45,991
For what reason, all of a sudden?

251
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,702
You told me
not to even look in that direction

252
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:51,246
in case we run into someone we know.

253
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:55,208
You must be deeply distressed.

254
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:00,339
You should have told me
if you wanted to go visit.

255
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:13,977
Stay here and rest.

256
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:15,562
I will bring your breakfast soon.

257
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:17,230
We should hurry before you are late.

258
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:20,192
I cannot go to the palace
for the time being.

259
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:23,945
I have been ordered to stay confined.

260
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,198
What?

261
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,325
Confinement?

262
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,160
Is that not a punishment?

263
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,579
What could they possibly punish you for?

264
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:33,497
What happened?

265
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,831
Tell me the reason.

266
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:40,462
Goodness.

267
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:44,966
Did the King become enraged
over the rumors of his attraction to men

268
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,261
that delighted Jeomine so much?

269
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,305
What do we do?

270
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:51,932
The Qing's envoy will arrive soon.

271
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:59,773
Let us not worry too much, my lady.

272
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,234
They say you can always

273
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:05,195
find a way out of a tiger's den
if only you pull yourself together.

274
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:07,739
I am sure some other means will come up.

275
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:09,741
It is not that.

276
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:14,204
Then what is the reason?

277
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,335
Why? What is it?

278
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:26,258
The King has found out…

279
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:30,345
that I am a woman.

280
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:51,448
Senior Court Lady Dong is missing.

281
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,203
Actually, due to the incident yesterday,

282
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:58,622
she has fallen ill and feverish.

283
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:02,417
I ordered her
not to come to serve you today.

284
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,676
I must see Court Lady Dong.

285
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,386
Go summon her.

286
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,352
Why are you standing around?

287
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:21,728
I ordered you to summon her.

288
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,397
I beg for your pardon.

289
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:28,443
Your Majesty!

290
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:30,612
Please take my life!

291
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,699
Did the Queen Dowager command it?

292
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,751
Where is Court Lady Dong?

293
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:47,212
Drag her out.

294
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,382
If you value your lives,

295
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,425
step back.

296
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:53,677
You wench!

297
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:56,721
How dare you disobey
Her Royal Highness's order?

298
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:58,557
As I serve His Majesty,

299
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,392
I will only take orders from him.

300
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:02,894
His Majesty's orders?

301
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:06,439
No one will fall for that now.

302
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:09,150
Your lies were uncovered
due to yesterday's event.

303
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:10,777
How dare you act high and mighty?

304
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:12,821
What are you waiting for?

305
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:14,281
Drag her out this moment!

306
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:15,323
If any one of you

307
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:17,409
dares to lay a finger on me,

308
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:20,287
I shall make a request to His Majesty

309
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:25,292
to have every limb of your body severed,
starting with those fingers.

310
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:37,095
Why are you having so much trouble
dragging out a mere court lady?

311
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:39,139
My apologies.

312
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,184
She put up a fight
with such a vicious attitude.

313
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,562
It was impossible to lay a finger on her.

314
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,024
Order the adjunct overseers
to expel her from the palace.

315
00:29:49,941 --> 00:29:51,359
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

316
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,947
Your Royal Highness, His Majesty is here.

317
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,159
Let him in.

318
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:16,134
I hope you had
a comfortable night, Mother.

319
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,639
I did indeed, Your Majesty.

320
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,236
Mother.

321
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:38,406
I am thinking of bestowing

322
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,285
the former First Senior Consort's abode
on Senior Court Lady Dong.

323
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,828
What do you think?

324
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:49,751
Your Majesty.

325
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:54,798
For what reason are you allowing her
to have her own place?

326
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,049
From what I heard,

327
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,302
you and she did not even
consummate your union.

328
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:03,556
Such an event is a mere formality.

329
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:06,601
She has served me for long

330
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,187
and will continue to do so in the future.

331
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,523
It is only right for her
to have her own place.

332
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:14,776
If Court Lady Dong wishes for it,

333
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:17,487
I will appoint her as a concubine as well.

334
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,907
That is ridiculous.

335
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:24,327
You should not allow her
a personal residence either.

336
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:28,289
Why do you disapprove of it?

337
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:31,459
Did you not want her to bear my son?

338
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,130
I am only trying to honor
you and the court's wishes.

339
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:37,882
Are you trying to mock me?

340
00:31:38,883 --> 00:31:41,428
As the feeble Queen
could not bear you an heir,

341
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,054
I approved of the consummation

342
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:47,100
in tears and heartbreak
only to secure an heir to your bloodline.

343
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:49,769
Forgive me,

344
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:52,772
but the feeble one is not the Queen

345
00:31:53,565 --> 00:31:54,983
but me.

346
00:31:56,401 --> 00:31:57,736
We should not be so greedy.

347
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,155
How could a bud sprout

348
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:02,323
when no seed has been sown in the field?

349
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:03,658
Do you not agree, My Queen?

350
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:07,245
Mind your words, Your Majesty!

351
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,916
Look at her.

352
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,126
How pathetic.

353
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:17,088
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

354
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,509
No man can understand heaven's will

355
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:24,637
as no child can ever fathom
their mother's heart.

356
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,598
I do not want to see any of you.

357
00:32:27,182 --> 00:32:28,725
Everyone, leave this moment!

358
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,937
Your Royal Highness,
I am to blame for this.

359
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:36,316
Please do not be upset and forgive us.

360
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,651
- Please forgive us, Your Royal Highness.
- Please forgive us, Your Royal Highness.

361
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:49,871
Mother.

362
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:53,333
I shall excuse myself
as I have matters of state to tend to.

363
00:32:58,254 --> 00:32:59,339
Your Majesty.

364
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:24,614
Your Majesty.

365
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,577
You have my approval

366
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,704
to skip today's greetings
and return to your quarters.

367
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:33,331
Pardon?

368
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:34,541
For what reason…

369
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:36,918
Forgive me for saying this,

370
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:40,922
but I have learned
that a greeting is not to be skipped

371
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:43,049
as it goes against the etiquette

372
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,344
and is deemed a failure of filial duty.

373
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:48,138
Has the Queen Dowager taught you that

374
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:49,931
whenever I skipped my greetings?

375
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:53,268
Yes.

376
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:03,945
The Queen Dowager is deeply upset,
even more so than ever.

377
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:06,114
Do you think you can handle it?

378
00:34:06,197 --> 00:34:08,074
Living in the palace,

379
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:10,952
at times, I must carry out duties
that I do not desire.

380
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,331
Also, such are things
I cannot entirely avoid.

381
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,251
Her fury finds itself back to me
in the end.

382
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:24,257
I have learned a lesson from you,
Grand Prince Munseong.

383
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,551
Make sure you greet her properly

384
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:29,637
and return to your duties.

385
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:39,898
Lord Park!

386
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:44,485
Do you not know
what His Majesty thinks of Yoo Hyun-bo?

387
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,197
He will not approve of
this recommendation.

388
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,408
His Majesty will approve of
the Border Defense Council's decision.

389
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,412
If he wishes to keep Gidaeryeong Kang
at Yeongchwijeong, that is.

390
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:56,789
What do you mean by that?

391
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:12,347
I have brought
what you have asked for, Lord Park.

392
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,683
These are the petitions seeking
an immediate removal of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

393
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:18,895
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo…

394
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,982
is indeed useful in many ways.

395
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,860
Do you not agree?

396
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:29,530
All right.

397
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:31,991
Let us go speak to His Majesty.

398
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:35,912
Lord Park.

399
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:38,957
I have an urgent matter to report.

400
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,500
Save it for later.

401
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,794
I am on my way
to make a request to His Majesty.

402
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,170
It concerns that very matter.

403
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,130
Last night,

404
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:49,092
His Majesty ordered the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
to be confined as a punishment.

405
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,102
He seemed to be so fond of him.

406
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:04,107
His Majesty would not expel
Kang Mong-woo like this, would he?

407
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,235
Who knows?

408
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:11,197
He may just give out a royal command
to behead Kang Mong-woo tomorrow.

409
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,448
My goodness.

410
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:14,951
Do not say such an awful thing
even as a joke.

411
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:20,164
His Majesty

412
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:22,417
is more than capable of such things.

413
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,459
Do not tell me

414
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:27,839
you have already forgotten
how my father lost his life.

415
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:37,682
What shall we do about this?

416
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,074
Your Majesty.

417
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:59,120
May I truly take up my abode
in the concubines' quarters?

418
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,166
If you wish,
I will appoint you a concubine as well.

419
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:09,922
As Her Royal Highness

420
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:12,759
would never allow the appointment,

421
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:15,136
I will only accept the house.

422
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:17,138
As you wish.

423
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,182
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

424
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,059
Your Majesty.

425
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,311
The Principal Director
requests an audience.

426
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:24,604
What shall I do?

427
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,191
Let him in.

428
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,178
You must have heard about
what happened to the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

429
00:37:58,513 --> 00:38:00,223
What took you so long to seek an audience?

430
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:02,850
I merely seek

431
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:05,770
to report what was discussed
by the Border Defense Council

432
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:08,981
and to ask for your opinion on the matter.

433
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:10,608
However,

434
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:14,529
I shall speak of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>'s matter
as you have mentioned it.

435
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:16,823
If I may be candid,

436
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:19,450
a part of me was hopeful.

437
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,412
As you have broken our promise,

438
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:25,581
I hoped that you would
adhere to my wishes this time.

439
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:27,125
However,

440
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,294
you punished the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
by ordering him to stay confined.

441
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:34,090
I did not expect you
to jump ahead and punish him

442
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,842
before I could speak with you.

443
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:38,719
I could not sit back and watch

444
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:40,721
when your next move was so obvious.

445
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:44,725
I warned you

446
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,395
when Prince Deokseong died, did I not?

447
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,692
That I would not hold back
should it happen again.

448
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,697
Have you forgotten already?

449
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:13,004
As the envoy escort
who will receive the Qing's envoy,

450
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,923
we seek to send
Yoo Hyun-bo, the Third Minister of Rites.

451
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:17,341
Please give us your approval.

452
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:29,187
He is not an appropriate candidate
as the envoy escort.

453
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:33,983
You are well aware of
the kind of man Jung Je-pyo is.

454
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:38,446
There is no one better than Yoo Hyun-bo
to handle a man like him.

455
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:41,866
Since when was Yoo Hyun-bo
such a capable man?

456
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,287
The Qing's envoy is visiting many areas
under the pretense of sightseeing,

457
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,206
looking for any opportunity to fault us.

458
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,875
It would be best to have them
at the capital as soon as possible

459
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,336
to receive the Emperor's letter
and send them back.

460
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:59,258
Your argument

461
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:01,886
has merit.

462
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:05,264
You have three days.

463
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,979
You may appoint Yoo Hyun-bo
as the envoy escort.

464
00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:16,651
However, if the Qing's envoy
does not reach the capital in three days,

465
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,736
both Yoo Hyun-bo

466
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:22,114
and you, who recommended him,
shall be held responsible.

467
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,911
I also have a condition.

468
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,540
If the Qing's envoy
arrives in the said period,

469
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,626
please dismiss Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

470
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:36,295
and exile him from the capital.

471
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,012
Would you accept the terms?

472
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,699
I will pour my heart and soul

473
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:07,034
not to betray your trust in me, my lord.

474
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:10,496
You must confirm one matter
when you meet Jung Je-pyo.

475
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:12,707
Please speak.

476
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:16,836
See if there are other letters
other than the Emperor's letter.

477
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:20,047
By "other letters,"

478
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:23,509
whose letter might you be referring to?

479
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:25,720
Prince Rui's.

480
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:31,934
Confirm if Jung Je-pyo
has brought Prince Rui's letter first

481
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,645
before compensating him with the riches.

482
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:35,730
Do you understand?

483
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:37,732
Yes, my lord.

484
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:44,530
Move aside!

485
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,924
The Principal Director
must have lost all sense of propriety.

486
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:06,510
How dare he demand
such an absurd condition to His Majesty?

487
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:10,306
Yoo Hyun-bo would never be able to
escort the envoy here in three days.

488
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:13,559
I hope His Majesty
takes this chance to reform

489
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:15,311
the corrupt Border Defense Council.

490
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,730
Park Jong-hwan is His Majesty's uncle

491
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:19,565
and the Queen Dowager's
only family member.

492
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,401
I feel heavy at heart

493
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:26,238
that I seem to have gotten you
on his bad side needlessly.

494
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:31,285
I only deferred to him until now
for your sake, Your Majesty.

495
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:34,872
And how did he treat the both of us?

496
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,041
The Principal Director
must come to understand

497
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:40,461
that even he cannot
have his way in all matters.

498
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:47,009
Your Majesty.

499
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:49,720
Grand Prince Munseong
is here to greet you.

500
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:50,680
Let him in.

501
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,603
Welcome, Grand Prince.

502
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,577
It has been a while, Great Lord.

503
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:15,496
Your Highness.

504
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:18,499
It has indeed been a while
since the <i>gisinje</i>.

505
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,546
Had I known the Great Lord was here,
I would have visited you later.

506
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:24,714
There is no need.

507
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:27,425
The Great Lord was on his way out.

508
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:30,136
Is that not right?

509
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,220
Pardon?

510
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,431
Yes.

511
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:35,474
Please excuse me, Your Majesty.

512
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:37,476
Bring in the refreshments.

513
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:39,770
Your Majesty.

514
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:43,274
Would you like to take a walk
in the Royal Garden afterward?

515
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,485
The sky today
is exceptionally clear and blue.

516
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:48,738
Is that so?

517
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:49,989
Then we must go.

518
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:52,408
Please invite Princess Jangryeong as well.

519
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:54,243
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:08,966
Sixth Royal Secretary.

521
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:11,343
Yes, Your Majesty.

522
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:14,430
Have you made any progress
with the peach tree?

523
00:44:15,931 --> 00:44:18,309
I acquired a compost
known to enhance soil fertility.

524
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,352
I am currently observing the tree
after scattering some.

525
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:32,406
Your Majesty.

526
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:40,456
What is the difference between
an act with knowledge and one without it?

527
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:47,713
Even done with knowledge,
an act is meaningless without virtue.

528
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,966
Even done in ignorance,
an act will see fruition

529
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,719
if it holds virtuous intent.

530
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:09,693
Have we not heard back from Kim Je-nam?

531
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:12,446
He seems to be uninterested
in a government post.

532
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,369
Dispatch a messenger
and have my wish conveyed clearly.

533
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:24,083
You may leave.

534
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,186
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

535
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,271
Summon the…

536
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:51,151
Shall I summon the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

537
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:54,363
I have misspoken.

538
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:55,531
There is no need.

539
00:45:59,702 --> 00:46:02,079
Has there been any progress
on finding what was lost?

540
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,210
We have combed through the capital,

541
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:11,630
but we have not found anyone
who knows of or holds the item.

542
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:14,967
They will be sending word again soon.

543
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,720
I shall discuss it with them then
and find another way.

544
00:46:17,803 --> 00:46:21,348
You must find it at all costs.

545
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:23,475
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

546
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:38,824
It has been a while, my lord.

547
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:41,160
Do you recognize me?

548
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,414
Has the <i>gidaeryeong </i>sent you?

549
00:46:46,624 --> 00:46:47,666
Yes, my lord.

550
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,877
You have been called to an urgent meeting.

551
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:53,297
Lead the way.

552
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:55,341
I will follow you.

553
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:18,155
Have you decided to live as Kang Hee-soo?

554
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,868
I only dressed like this as a disguise.

555
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,454
I would be asking for trouble

556
00:47:25,537 --> 00:47:27,581
to meet you while receiving my punishment

557
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:30,042
as Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

558
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,380
The King's refusal to consummate
and his order for your punishment

559
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:35,923
has the entire court in turmoil.

560
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:38,967
As they cannot fathom
the reason behind his actions,

561
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:40,761
they must be confused and frightened.

562
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:43,681
And you are not?

563
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:46,725
I, too, was afraid at first.

564
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:47,851
However,

565
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:51,480
the King's bet over you
with Principal Director Park Jong-hwan

566
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:52,690
changed my mind.

567
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:55,150
The King

568
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:59,071
seems to have placed you in confinement
to protect you.

569
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:02,950
What I do not understand

570
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,577
is the fact that he proposed
the three-day period first.

571
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,789
Yoo Hyun-bo will do his best
to make that happen.

572
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,876
Why did the King propose
a condition unfavorable to himself?

573
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,173
The King has set up a trap

574
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,342
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.

575
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:22,761
A trap?

576
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:24,972
What could he have up his sleeve
to set up one?

577
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:27,182
That much

578
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:29,351
is unknown to me.

579
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,982
I suggest we pretend
that our conversations did not take place.

580
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:38,652
My priority is the well-being
of Their Highnesses.

581
00:48:38,736 --> 00:48:39,903
I came by to tell you that.

582
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,282
I understand your wishes, Lord Kim.

583
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:44,199
However,

584
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,327
I do not think we can pretend
they did not take place…

585
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:52,291
with the Qing's envoy on their way.

586
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:54,585
What do you mean?

587
00:48:55,127 --> 00:48:57,254
What does the Qing's envoy
have to do with us?

588
00:48:57,755 --> 00:48:59,339
If my assumption is correct,

589
00:49:00,424 --> 00:49:04,428
a difficult ordeal
will be upon Their Highnesses.

590
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,697
I have returned, my lady.

591
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:29,995
I have heard about the confinement.

592
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:33,332
I should have waited
around the courtesan house

593
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:36,001
and brought you home, my lady.

594
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:38,253
It is in the past.

595
00:49:39,004 --> 00:49:40,005
Tell me.

596
00:49:40,088 --> 00:49:42,466
How is Master Choam doing?

597
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,427
He is doing well.

598
00:49:45,511 --> 00:49:49,181
A court official was dispatched again
to convince him to take up a post.

599
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:52,017
He said he did not give them an answer.

600
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:57,773
Did you tell him not to refuse,
but to accept the offer next time?

601
00:49:57,856 --> 00:49:59,566
He promised that he would.

602
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,361
However,

603
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,780
if Yoo Hyun-bo returns in three days

604
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:06,990
and the King does not summon you again,

605
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,742
what will you do?

606
00:50:11,203 --> 00:50:14,832
Even with Kim Myung-ha's support
and Master Choam's return to the court,

607
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,709
what could possibly change?

608
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:20,838
What are you trying to say?

609
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:23,298
If your plan goes to shambles,

610
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:26,218
I will take the initiative

611
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:28,679
just as you promised me before.

612
00:50:32,516 --> 00:50:34,142
Nothing is set in stone.

613
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:36,436
Even if I am dismissed,

614
00:50:38,313 --> 00:50:39,648
I will not give up.

615
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:46,905
I truly wish that things turn out
the way you have planned.

616
00:51:21,023 --> 00:51:23,191
Your Majesty,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

617
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:29,698
Your Majesty.

618
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:33,452
The Qing's chief envoy, Podan,
has arrived at Mohwa Guesthouse.

619
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:58,685
Your Majesty.

620
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:01,897
Please prepare to head out
to receive the Emperor's letter.

621
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:05,984
I do not think I will be able to go
as I am suddenly feeling ill.

622
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:10,113
Please go and receive the Emperor's letter
on my behalf, Uncle.

623
00:52:10,197 --> 00:52:12,866
To my eye, you seem very hearty.

624
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,703
I am afraid that the envoy
might be enraged if I go in your stead.

625
00:52:17,996 --> 00:52:19,665
If we hold a welcoming feast tonight

626
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:21,959
and relieve the exhaustion of the envoys,

627
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:24,628
there will not be a problem.

628
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:26,421
Your Majesty.

629
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:30,258
The three days we have promised
have not yet passed.

630
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:35,305
I hope you have not forgotten
the promise you made…

631
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,059
to dismiss and expel the <i>gidaeryeong.</i>

632
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:44,272
I have not.

633
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:48,151
Then I shall abide by your royal command.

634
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:10,257
We shall go to the Mohwa Guesthouse
to receive the envoy.

635
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,425
Get ready.

636
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:12,509
- Yes, Lord Park.
- Yes, Lord Park.

637
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,601
My lord, have you summoned me?

638
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:24,229
Immediately arrest
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

639
00:53:24,312 --> 00:53:25,856
and bring him to the State Tribunal.

640
00:53:26,565 --> 00:53:27,691
Yes, my lord.

641
00:53:29,568 --> 00:53:30,694
Lord Park.

642
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:33,697
He is the Fourth Investigator
of the State Tribunal.

643
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:36,199
It is not like Kang Mong-woo
committed high treason.

644
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:43,248
The crime of disturbing the king's heart,
defiling the order of the court,

645
00:53:44,207 --> 00:53:46,418
and weakening the people's hearts.

646
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:47,961
Tell me.

647
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:50,338
What are these crimes, if not treason?

648
00:54:01,016 --> 00:54:04,352
The Principal Director is determined
to kill the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

649
00:54:09,775 --> 00:54:11,318
There is trouble, Myung-ha.

650
00:54:11,902 --> 00:54:15,238
The Principal Director gave the order
to arrest Kang Mong-woo for high treason.

651
00:54:23,248 --> 00:54:25,083
I must meet His Majesty immediately.

652
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,293
Please request an audience.

653
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,129
I have already told you that you cannot.

654
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:30,547
Please return.

655
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:33,008
Eunuch Kim.

656
00:54:34,134 --> 00:54:35,761
How dare a royal secretary

657
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:37,971
behave so crudely
before His Majesty's quarters?

658
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:43,560
I apologize, but there is
an urgent matter I must inform him.

659
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:46,354
It is an important matter
that His Majesty must know about.

660
00:54:46,438 --> 00:54:48,440
Is that matter
more important than the Qing's envoy?

661
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:53,320
Your important duty
is to prepare to receive the envoy.

662
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,363
Return to your post and get back to work.

663
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:57,365
Immediately!

664
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:09,878
Where are you going, my lady?

665
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:12,255
After being stuck here
for the last few days,

666
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:13,715
I feel suffocated.

667
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:15,592
I will go get some air.

668
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:18,678
Getting air, my foot.
You should be running away.

669
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:21,264
The Qing's envoy has arrived.

670
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,851
And where do you say we run to?

671
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:27,562
Are you sure we will not be caught?

672
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:29,314
Well…

673
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:31,233
It is better than waiting for the noose.

674
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,486
I will be back shortly.

675
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,114
My lady.

676
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:38,990
My lady.

677
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,009
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo?

678
00:55:58,677 --> 00:55:59,928
That is me.

679
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:03,306
Arrest his man immediately.

680
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,224
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

681
00:56:09,187 --> 00:56:10,021
My lord!

682
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,648
- Back off!
- Goodness.

683
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,732
Jageunnyeon.

684
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:17,112
These officers
are harming innocent people!

685
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:30,208
I shall follow you obediently.

686
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,210
Please refrain from needless violence.

687
00:56:33,628 --> 00:56:34,713
Why are you standing about?

688
00:56:34,796 --> 00:56:36,631
Arrest the criminal this instant.

689
00:56:36,715 --> 00:56:37,632
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

690
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:20,277
I commend you for your efforts
in making such a long journey.

691
00:58:21,152 --> 00:58:24,030
I was concerned
as I heard that you had fallen ill.

692
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:27,617
It is of much relief that you seem
to be feeling much better now.

693
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:31,204
It appears my concern for your ill health
was unnecessary.

694
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:36,459
As I felt bad for not being able
to receive the Emperor's letter myself,

695
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:37,502
I tried my best

696
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:40,463
to attend this feast at the least.

697
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:42,882
He has brought himself
to receive the letter.

698
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:44,801
I do speak Joseon's language.

699
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:48,388
Do not try to deceive me
and interpret properly.

700
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:50,849
I apologize. Please forgive me.

701
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,435
I hope the feast is to your liking.

702
00:58:55,395 --> 00:58:58,398
I am rather disappointed.

703
00:58:59,399 --> 00:59:01,318
I expected to see something better.

704
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:04,487
Something better?

705
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:09,117
Please tell me what you mean by it.
I shall have it brought here.

706
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,995
I heard of the <i>gidaeryeong</i> on my way here.

707
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:13,038
Word has it

708
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:15,540
that he is quite
an excellent <i>baduk </i>player.

709
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,586
Is that so?

710
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:25,342
Did you perchance forget
that I like <i>baduk</i>?

711
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:29,012
How shall I forget?

712
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:32,015
Our close friendship was formed

713
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:35,644
thanks to <i>baduk</i> games
all those years ago in Shenyang.

714
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:39,230
Right. That is true.

715
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:42,442
Where is the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

716
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:44,235
Who is it…

717
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:46,780
among them?

718
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:49,491
The recent development
must not have reached you, Chief Envoy.

719
00:59:50,075 --> 00:59:53,203
As the <i>gidaeryeong</i> was dismissed
and expelled from the capital,

720
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:54,621
he is not present here.

721
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:57,040
I beg for your understanding.

722
00:59:57,624 --> 01:00:01,503
His Majesty can simply summon
the <i>gidaeryeong</i> back, can he not?

723
01:00:03,463 --> 01:00:05,382
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

724
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:06,675
You are not wrong.

725
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:08,843
I shall summon him should you wish.

726
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:11,638
Your Majesty, that cannot happen.

727
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,100
You would be breaking the promise
you have made to me.

728
01:00:15,183 --> 01:00:16,768
Is your petty promise so important

729
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:19,062
when we have our treasured guest to serve?

730
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:27,320
Are you attempting to humiliate me
before the Qing Emperor's envoy?

731
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:37,539
<i>What I do not understand</i>

732
01:00:37,622 --> 01:00:40,208
<i>is the fact that he proposed
the three-day period first.</i>

733
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,460
The King has set up a trap

734
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:44,379
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.

735
01:00:45,046 --> 01:00:46,089
A trap?

736
01:00:46,172 --> 01:00:48,258
What could he have up his sleeve
to set up one?

737
01:00:49,134 --> 01:00:50,218
That much

738
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:52,262
is unknown to me.

739
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:57,267
He had set up a trap

740
01:00:58,393 --> 01:00:59,728
with the envoy up his sleeve.

741
01:01:02,313 --> 01:01:03,440
Principal Director.

742
01:01:04,899 --> 01:01:06,693
My apologies, Your Majesty.

743
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:10,155
Please forgive me for my discourtesy.

744
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:16,202
Hear my command.

745
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:21,249
Bring the <i>gidaeryeong</i> here.

746
01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:50,630
He is young.

747
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:55,593
I thought he would be around my age.

748
01:02:57,262 --> 01:03:01,724
Did you not mention
that you were a famed <i>baduk </i>prodigy

749
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,811
from a young age as well?

750
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:06,980
I played <i>baduk </i>before I walked.

751
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:11,693
I would like to play <i>baduk</i>
with the <i>gidaeryeong</i> this instant.

752
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:14,112
Would that be possible?

753
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:17,824
Your Majesty.

754
01:03:18,908 --> 01:03:21,411
Would you allow me
to speak on this matter?

755
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:22,579
You may speak.

756
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:25,915
With all due respect to the envoy,

757
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:29,127
that man is a criminal
who was dismissed and expelled.

758
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:32,964
Your authority will be weakened
if you allow a criminal

759
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:35,341
to play <i>baduk </i>with the envoy
in front of everyone.

760
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:43,141
Your Majesty.

761
01:03:43,224 --> 01:03:45,184
Might I propose another idea?

762
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:47,061
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>…

763
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:49,439
No, the criminal and I

764
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:51,274
will play a <i>baduk </i>with a bet.

765
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:53,234
If I win,

766
01:03:53,318 --> 01:03:55,445
I shall decide his fate however I see fit.

767
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:57,030
If I lose,

768
01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,199
the Principal Director
shall decide his fate.

769
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:04,704
How does that sound?

770
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,878
As you insist on playing with him,

771
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:15,048
I will not go against you
on this matter any further.

772
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:20,762
Your Majesty.

773
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:24,807
Mong-woo.

774
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,685
What do you say?

775
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:37,820
I would not refuse such a great honor

776
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:40,698
to play against the Emperor's subject.

777
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:45,536
All right.

778
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:48,081
Shall we begin?

779
01:04:55,046 --> 01:04:57,799
Bring a <i>baduk </i>table and the stones.

780
01:06:40,193 --> 01:06:43,154
CAPTIVATING THE KING

781
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:45,031
<i>You are my </i>gidaeryeong.

782
01:06:45,114 --> 01:06:47,575
<i>You must come running
whenever I summon you.</i>

783
01:06:47,658 --> 01:06:48,701
I have missed you.

784
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:51,871
<i>How can you get revenge when you love him?</i>

785
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:55,708
<i>The King is my one and only family
before he is my lord.</i>

786
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,877
We are bound by the heavens.

787
01:06:58,544 --> 01:06:59,754
<i>I implore you, Your Majesty.</i>

788
01:07:00,338 --> 01:07:02,423
<i>Please do not command me
to marry Prince Rui.</i>

789
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:04,258
<i>I desired power.</i>

790
01:07:04,342 --> 01:07:07,929
<i>I thought it was the only way
to protect those that I wished to protect.</i>

791
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:09,680
<i>Through this marriage,</i>

792
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:12,100
<i>I seek to plant a spy
in Prince Rui's inner circle.</i>

793
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:13,643
Are you suggesting a substitution?

794
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:18,893
