1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:05,872
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:07,171
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:08,480
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,841
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

5
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,011
<i>Fourth Investigator.</i>

6
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,770
This is not the way to the State Tribunal.

7
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:43,732
Upon whose command are you arresting me?

8
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:09,507
I will take it from here.

9
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:11,134
Untie the rope.

10
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:12,510
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

11
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,201
Go on inside.

12
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:49,714
What took you so long?

13
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:52,759
Did you forget your duties
as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

14
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,719
to come running to me upon my summon?

15
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,016
This will not do.

16
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,893
I shall have to punish you harshly.

17
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,982
Do not think for a second
that I will overlook your crimes

18
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:09,776
due to that night.

19
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,863
I cannot dare to think in such a manner.

20
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:16,032
I have…

21
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,827
already erased my memory of that night.

22
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:23,289
You did what?

23
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:25,959
Upon whose orders?

24
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,764
I have missed you.

25
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,661
Why are you not saying anything?

26
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,417
I thought…

27
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:12,255
that you might never summon me again.

28
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,509
I returned to the palace without a word

29
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:18,928
and ordered you to stay confined

30
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,891
to deter the court from attacking you.

31
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,353
What is going to happen to me now?

32
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:31,983
You must have heard about the bet I made.

33
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,652
I shall order Sang-hwa

34
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:38,406
to stay vigilant
so that word inside the palace

35
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,617
does not travel beyond the palace walls.

36
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,912
Please tell me.

37
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:48,499
You are my <i>gidaeryeong.</i>

38
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,627
You must come running
whenever I summon you.

39
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,922
I shall do the same.

40
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,511
If you call for me,

41
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,850
I shall come running to you.

42
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,804
Who do you think will win?

43
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:26,931
No matter who wins,

44
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,599
Kang Mong-woo is in a tight spot.

45
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,768
He is indeed stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

46
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:32,747
This is…

47
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,167
a <i>jangsaeng</i>.

48
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,252
A <i>jangsaeng</i>?

49
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:40,713
What is a <i>jangsaeng</i>?

50
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,549
It means that the victor cannot be decided

51
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,593
as the game has reached an impasse.

52
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,387
So in other words, a tie.

53
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:50,932
How could this be?

54
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,268
He made it.

55
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:55,311
He will live.

56
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:06,364
Such an auspicious sign is said to be seen

57
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,741
once in a thousand years.

58
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:14,247
Never have I seen this
in my entire life of playing <i>baduk</i>.

59
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:16,541
He has played <i>baduk </i>all his life,

60
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,044
but this is the first time
seeing such an auspicious sign.

61
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:23,131
This is my first time
seeing a <i>jangsaeng</i> as well.

62
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:25,591
What a bummer.

63
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,052
Had I won,

64
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,180
I would have taken him to the Great Qing

65
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,558
and offered him
as a tribute to our Emperor.

66
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:39,188
As our Emperor loves <i>baduk</i> as well,

67
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,359
he would be quite amazed
to hear of what happened today.

68
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:50,241
I am pleased that you are satisfied.

69
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:52,785
Yeongchwijeong.

70
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:55,746
I have heard stories of the place.

71
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,040
May I take a look inside?

72
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,752
I do not allow visitors normally.

73
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:04,255
However,

74
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:07,633
I will open its doors just for you.

75
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,096
Let us go.

76
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,354
Did you not hear His Majesty?

77
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,523
You stay here.

78
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,328
Rumor has it

79
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,206
that you are His Majesty's confidant.

80
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,377
I am merely a <i>gidaeryeong</i>
who responds to His Majesty's call

81
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,338
for a game of <i>baduk</i>.

82
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,310
Did you intentionally
end the game in a tie?

83
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,354
With all due respect,

84
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:04,690
it is extremely difficult
to reach a tie in <i>baduk</i>.

85
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:08,736
We only reached a tie out of sheer luck.

86
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,532
By that claim, you are suggesting
that the heavens are helping you.

87
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,451
Those are some arrogant words, indeed.

88
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:19,789
I am curious to see how long
the heavens will stay on your side.

89
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,361
Was it truly through luck?

90
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,240
Yes, I was lucky enough

91
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:58,411
to spot the move that would force a tie.

92
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,873
At any rate,
I am relieved that you are back.

93
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:04,208
It took a load off my mind.

94
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,003
We will truly need luck on our side

95
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,255
from this point on.

96
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:16,846
The envoy has arrived,

97
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,140
but he has not said anything unusual.

98
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,642
It appears your concern is in vain.

99
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:26,480
I also hope that my prediction is wrong.

100
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,657
You sounded so confident.

101
00:10:38,743 --> 00:10:41,454
And yet, your plans
to cast the <i>gidaeryeong</i> away

102
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:44,623
have failed once again.

103
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,295
I suppose you are
not the only one to blame

104
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,964
as the King broke his promise first.

105
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:55,718
But how could he have refused
when the Qing's envoy was insisting?

106
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,559
Principal Director.

107
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:05,686
Are you listening?

108
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,981
Tonight,

109
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:14,612
His Majesty has humiliated me
before the Qing's envoy

110
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,405
and all the members of his court.

111
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,242
I have endured unbearable sufferings

112
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,411
to help His Majesty ascend to the throne,

113
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:25,539
stayed on as the Principal Director,
a mere honorary position,

114
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:29,085
and spent all these years
as his loyal subject.

115
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,379
However,

116
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,714
he dishonored all my sacrifices.

117
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,011
Not even high treason
would call for such a humiliation.

118
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:45,101
Even if I stepped down from my post
and left for our family's hometown,

119
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,229
no one would condemn me.

120
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:49,522
Leave for our hometown?

121
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,316
I understand
that you are deeply insulted, but…

122
00:11:56,445 --> 00:11:57,446
Nonetheless,

123
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:02,159
the King is my one and only family
before he is my lord.

124
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,620
We are bound by the heavens.

125
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:09,875
How could one dare to discard a bond
established by the heavens?

126
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,129
If anyone dares to attempt it,

127
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:17,425
whoever it may be, I, Park Jong-hwan,
will not condone such behavior.

128
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:23,973
Of course, I understand your true heart.

129
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:28,727
The King, too, will come to understand
your profound insight one day.

130
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:40,990
By the way,

131
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,492
what about the letter?

132
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:45,369
That matter,

133
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,998
you need not worry about.

134
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:50,958
Are you sure?

135
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,002
I have confirmed it with Jung Je-pyo.

136
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,422
Your biggest concern

137
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,258
shall disappear soon.

138
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,065
What do you mean?

139
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,444
There is another letter
apart from the one from the Emperor?

140
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,821
It is a letter
written by Prince Rui himself.

141
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,407
I did not get to read it,
as I am the Emperor's subject,

142
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:26,410
but Jung Je-pyo did,
as he is Prince Rui's subject.

143
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:30,164
He will deliver it to you soon in person.

144
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:33,584
For what reason
has Prince Rui sent a letter?

145
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,295
Merely mentioning it as much
turns me into a spy,

146
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:39,089
which is punishable by death.

147
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,800
It is only out of our friendship
forged in Shenyang

148
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,011
that I am sharing this news.

149
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,348
Please tell me.

150
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,683
What is the content of that letter?

151
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:54,438
"I shall take the Princess of Joseon,

152
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,066
Princess Jangryeong, to be my wife."

153
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:59,235
"With my marital ties
to the royal family of Joseon,

154
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:04,365
I hope to strengthen
the bond between our two nations."

155
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:53,998
Prince Rui has sent a letter

156
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,001
requesting Princess Jangryeong's hand
in marriage.

157
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,838
It is a request in name only,

158
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:03,215
when it is an order in truth.

159
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:05,134
Even a commoner's marriage proposal

160
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:08,095
is carried out with respect
per the proper customs.

161
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,763
This is beyond discourteous.

162
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:13,642
You should not accept
this marriage proposal.

163
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,107
A letter from Prince Rui himself

164
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,568
is as good as a marriage proposal
from him in person.

165
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:23,736
Its refusal

166
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,031
may bring extreme adversities
that cannot be overcome.

167
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,075
Your Majesty.

168
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,328
Envoy Escort Yoo Hyun-bo

169
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:35,289
has obtained a piece of information
from Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo.

170
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,207
Report it to me.

171
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,882
Jung Je-pyo proudly stated

172
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:49,011
that Prince Rui's authority stands strong
and his future is bright

173
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:51,096
and the court officials who follow him

174
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,016
are greater in number than those
who follow the young Emperor.

175
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,851
As such, if the marriage goes through,

176
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,479
the Qing would thus bestow
its full trust upon Joseon.

177
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:02,524
He stated that this would serve
as a great benefit to Joseon.

178
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:10,491
Your Majesty.

179
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,452
If you do not wish
to part with Princess Jangryeong,

180
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:16,497
choose another young woman
who shares a close kinship with you

181
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,374
and offer her as an alternative.

182
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,209
That cannot happen.

183
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:24,880
Sending anyone other than the Princess
would be no different from a rebuff.

184
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:27,341
Emperors and kings of the past
all made similar compromises.

185
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,301
We can at least propose this to him.

186
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,804
- Your Majesty--
- I have heard all your thoughts.

187
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:34,181
I shall…

188
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:40,854
accept Prince Rui's request

189
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,273
for the Princess's hand.

190
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,495
Make preparations for her wedding.

191
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,099
Princess.

192
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,565
I implore you, Your Majesty.

193
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:27,151
Please do not command me
to marry Prince Rui.

194
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,617
Do not just stand about.

195
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,703
Hurry up and escort her out of here.

196
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:40,080
Your Highness.

197
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,623
You should not act thusly.

198
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:47,254
Your Majesty.

199
00:17:47,796 --> 00:17:50,382
Considering your generosity
toward both my brother and me,

200
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,634
I am more than duty-bound
to follow your orders.

201
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,637
I also understand
I do not even deserve Prince Rui

202
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,723
and that this marriage is a duty

203
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:01,393
I must carry out to serve you,
the court, and the royal family.

204
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:05,230
Continue.

205
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:07,941
However,

206
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,822
I also have the duty
to abide by my late mother's last words.

207
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:18,786
If I cannot even uphold her last wish
to protect my one and only brother,

208
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,705
how could I manage a married life
that is crucial in maintaining peace

209
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:23,082
between the Qing and Joseon?

210
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,627
I must confess

211
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,546
that I am lacking and foolish,

212
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,800
which will cause distress
to the Qing's court and Prince Rui.

213
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:34,718
This would mean

214
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,262
that I will cause distress
to you and this nation.

215
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,808
I dare not hope to survive
after committing such a grave crime.

216
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,893
Even after death,

217
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:45,813
how will I bear facing my late parents?

218
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,233
Your Majesty.

219
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,153
If you have the slightest pity for me,

220
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:56,406
please let me avert this marriage.

221
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,423
I understand. You should stand up now.

222
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,396
If I could let my emotions rule me,

223
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,109
I would never send you at any cost.

224
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,612
However,

225
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,158
I am the king of this nation.

226
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,787
As I cannot neglect my duties as the king,

227
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,793
I cannot grant your request.

228
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:53,565
What would you do, Mong-woo?

229
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:55,859
In what way

230
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,072
would you save this <i>gonma</i>?

231
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,490
GONMA: A STONE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SAVE

232
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,454
Should you wish not to send Her Highness,

233
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:09,581
there is just one way.

234
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:18,131
Though belated,
you can decline the marriage offer.

235
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,429
That is what I wish to do.

236
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,101
However,

237
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,228
I cannot.

238
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:33,397
<i>If…</i>

239
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:35,691
I were to decline this marriage offer

240
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,528
and refuse to send the Princess,

241
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:41,488
what would happen?

242
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:44,449
Prince Rui's regency will not last.

243
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,910
He will have to relinquish
his powers to the Emperor.

244
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:51,498
As such, Prince Rui
is testing Joseon's loyalty.

245
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,501
If Joseon declines his offer of marriage,

246
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,628
the Qing's court will feel anxious.

247
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:01,258
They will swiftly impose a ban
on the repatriation of your people

248
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:03,719
and wage war.

249
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:12,519
Prince Rui's sudden request
for the hand of Joseon's Princess

250
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:16,273
was to keep the young Emperor in check

251
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,233
and lay out plans for the future.

252
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,915
I desired power.

253
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:39,629
I thought it was the only way
to protect those that I wished to protect.

254
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,966
Hence, I ascended to the throne.

255
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,220
I was foolish.

256
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,558
Protecting my seat on the throne…

257
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:57,439
always came before
protecting what I truly wished.

258
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,035
The king has power,

259
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,330
and yet, he is powerless.

260
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,920
That is as it should be,

261
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,092
and it is therefore agonizing.

262
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:05,966
I was naive.

263
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,138
After seeing the King
take His Highness to <i>gisinje</i>,

264
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,597
I had let my guard down.

265
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:17,310
It was only a scheme
to silence the ill rumors.

266
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,314
Do not blame yourself, my lord.

267
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,483
In situations like this,

268
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,777
you must stay
all the more composed and rational.

269
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:34,411
I suspect

270
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:37,622
that this marriage ploy
not only targets Her Highness

271
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:39,833
but also His Highness.

272
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,337
I agree.

273
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:46,423
When Her Highness leaves,

274
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:49,134
talks of His Highness's marriage
will begin soon after.

275
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,761
It can only be easier to act against him

276
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:53,346
if he is outside the palace.

277
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:56,474
What do you propose that we do?

278
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:00,395
As the King has approved the marriage,

279
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:04,232
it will take its place no matter what.

280
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,444
We can neither refuse nor avoid it.

281
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:09,905
However,

282
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:12,991
we can take advantage of it.

283
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,497
What do you mean?

284
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:20,916
Here is my plan.

285
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,210
Through this marriage,

286
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:26,129
I seek to plant a spy
in Prince Rui's inner circle.

287
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,801
Her Highness may be astute,

288
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,512
but she cannot act as a spy.

289
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,933
First of all, she does not speak
the Qing's language.

290
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,936
Further, she has no notion
of keeping her thoughts secret.

291
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,813
I am suggesting
that we send a spy in her place.

292
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,152
Do not tell me…

293
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,404
you are suggesting a substitution?

294
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,747
That cannot happen.

295
00:26:01,414 --> 00:26:02,832
If we were to get caught,

296
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,670
Her Highness and His Highness
would both fall in danger.

297
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:11,883
In any case, this is not for us to decide.

298
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,636
We need the approval and determination

299
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,805
of Their Highnesses.

300
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,232
To speak the truth,

301
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,196
I do not understand what the point is.

302
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,909
The Grand Prince and I will be
separated nonetheless.

303
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:46,330
It is hard to believe that there is a way
to avoid getting caught.

304
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,749
I am afraid

305
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,836
that this plan may place
the Grand Prince in more danger.

306
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:55,631
Your Highness.

307
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,008
What you say is right.

308
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:01,220
What are your thoughts, Myung-ha?

309
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,556
Do not mind my opinion.

310
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,352
If you two disagree with the plan,
we will not carry it out.

311
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:10,896
Who would this benefit?

312
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:18,153
It would benefit
this nation and its people.

313
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:22,616
This is the one and only way

314
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,202
we can learn Prince Rui's
thoughts and plan

315
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,871
for this nation.

316
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,248
Are you certain?

317
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:32,543
Can you swear
that this plan was not concocted

318
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:34,378
for your personal gain?

319
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,052
As Her Highness has already stated,

320
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:45,723
this is indeed a risky plan
that may bring more risks than benefits.

321
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:48,267
Were it for my personal gain,

322
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:51,311
I could always resort to easier ways.

323
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,481
If you cannot trust my sincerity,

324
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:56,483
do not approve of the plan.

325
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,654
I will follow your wishes.

326
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:11,498
I do not wish to endanger
the Grand Prince further for my sake.

327
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,167
- So--
- I…

328
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,377
approve.

329
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,339
Do you mean that, Grand Prince?

330
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,674
You do not have to do this for me.

331
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:24,094
To speak the truth,

332
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,890
the idea of you marrying a man
who lives tens of thousands of <i>li</i> away

333
00:28:28,932 --> 00:28:29,975
is detestable to me.

334
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:34,188
However, that is not my only reason.

335
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,982
It is because I trust you, Master.

336
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:41,070
Also, it will aid this nation
and its people.

337
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,614
How could I not approve of the plan?

338
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:57,252
Now then, shall we play <i>baduk</i>?

339
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:08,847
Grand Prince.

340
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:33,455
It bothers me
that the Great Lord suggested

341
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,916
sending another woman
from the royal family

342
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,501
during the assembly earlier.

343
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:40,462
Are you suggesting
they might substitute the Princess?

344
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,636
Your concern is in vain.

345
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,598
The Grand Prince and the Princess
do not have the nerve to do so.

346
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:53,559
No one knows for sure.

347
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,310
Furthermore…

348
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:04,486
We should of course
take measures if that is the case.

349
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,283
But if the King finds out,

350
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:10,909
he will be infuriated.

351
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:14,121
His Majesty heads out for a hunt
with Envoy Podan tomorrow.

352
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:16,790
No issues will arise
if we use that window of opportunity.

353
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,257
Would you like to
accompany me to the hunt?

354
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,681
It would be better for me to stay here.

355
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:38,353
I…

356
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:40,939
would like you to accompany me.

357
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:47,988
It would be difficult for me
to hide my feelings when I am with you.

358
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:51,450
People will catch on
and begin to suspect me.

359
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,453
Would you not mind that?

360
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,458
Goodness.

361
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:07,758
Podan will be very disappointed.

362
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,893
Three years ago,

363
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,942
if we had not met,

364
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:31,532
you would be living a peaceful life
as someone's wife.

365
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,249
As I cannot live as your woman,

366
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,919
I will stay by your side
as your <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

367
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:56,867
I do not think this is right.

368
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,828
How can you get revenge when you love him?

369
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,916
My feelings for him
do not change anything.

370
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:08,253
I will take advantage of them.

371
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:11,423
I will fool the King with my love

372
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:13,383
and achieve my goal.

373
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:15,844
I will make sure…

374
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,556
that he is dethroned.

375
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:22,517
My lady.

376
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:25,729
Our hearts aren't like <i>baduk </i>stones.

377
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:31,276
They cannot be controlled
the way you set stones on the table.

378
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,696
I am afraid.

379
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:40,410
You could hurt yourself
and end up at death's door again,

380
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:42,371
and that scares me.

381
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,753
What is there to be scared about?

382
00:33:50,337 --> 00:33:52,798
All the events that I fear
have already happened.

383
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:54,466
Death?

384
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,386
As I have already experienced it before,

385
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:00,055
it frightens me no longer.

386
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:17,614
Good night.

387
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:53,150
What is the matter?

388
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:58,697
Forgive me, but I am afraid

389
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,033
that I cannot ride a horse
due to the return of my chronic illness.

390
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,872
How is an aching knee a chronic illness?

391
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:14,713
I understand.

392
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,924
Have the Royal Clinic brew herbal medicine

393
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,801
for the Principal Director's knees.

394
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:22,053
Yes, Your Majesty. I shall.

395
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,723
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

396
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,571
There is no need for herbal medicine.

397
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,865
Yes, Lord Park.

398
00:36:04,554 --> 00:36:05,931
Please wait, my lady.

399
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,601
How dare you get in her way?

400
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:26,451
You should have started off with this.

401
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:27,744
My lady.

402
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,539
Please take good care of Bun-yeong.

403
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,417
I shall try.

404
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,423
Goodbye, my lady.

405
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,528
My lady.

406
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:03,446
What brings you here at this hour?

407
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,699
I am here to convey
Her Royal Highness's order.

408
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:08,451
You and the court maids here

409
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,996
are to be transferred
to another residence immediately.

410
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:15,125
Pardon? Another residence?

411
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,877
- This is too--
- We have no time for explanation.

412
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,044
Get out of here now.

413
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:31,099
You. Stop right there.

414
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,614
As you are new here, you may stay.

415
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:48,199
Yes, my lady.

416
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,344
<i>Last night,
upon the Queen Dowager's orders,</i>

417
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:11,056
<i>the court maids at the service
of Her Highness were all removed.</i>

418
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:16,186
<i>Thankfully, I managed to avert the crisis
and stayed at Her Highness's quarters.</i>

419
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,647
I do not need your service.

420
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,565
I will only let this maid tend to me,

421
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,275
so you may all leave.

422
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,862
Her Royal Highness
will not approve of this.

423
00:38:29,324 --> 00:38:32,494
I am the future spouse of Prince Rui.

424
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,955
How dare you stand there
when I ordered you to leave?

425
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,050
Your Highness.

426
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,140
<i>It was a risky situation,</i>

427
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,226
<i>but it passed without trouble.</i>

428
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:09,906
You have been summoned.

429
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:13,159
Has His Majesty returned already?

430
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:14,202
No, my lord.

431
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,538
Her Majesty has summoned you.

432
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,175
I called you to ask that you look after
the Grand Prince and the Princess.

433
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,927
Last night,

434
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:34,764
all of the court ladies and court maids
at the Princess's quarters were replaced.

435
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:38,101
So I see.

436
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:41,646
I would like to help,

437
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,649
but I am afraid
I might cause even bigger trouble.

438
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:47,777
As such, I have a request.

439
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:54,409
Could you stand by
the Grand Prince and the Princess?

440
00:39:58,038 --> 00:40:01,291
However meager my influence is,
I shall abide by your order

441
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:02,959
and assist Their Highnesses.

442
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,170
Please do not be concerned.

443
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:10,008
Thank you.

444
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:12,927
Your Majesty.

445
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,554
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.

446
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,015
Shall I tell her to come back later?

447
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:20,351
No, let her in.

448
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:35,658
Your Majesty.

449
00:40:35,742 --> 00:40:37,327
- Did you summon me?
- You wench.

450
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,413
Do you truly have a death wish?

451
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:44,292
How dare you replace the court maids
and court ladies serving the Princess?

452
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,047
Your Majesty,
there must be a misunderstanding.

453
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,381
I would not dare to try

454
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:53,343
to replace them
on a whim and without an order.

455
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:55,220
How dare you feign ignorance?

456
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:58,640
I know you have been secretly controlling
the matters of the palace.

457
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:04,104
It is against the rules
to discuss the matters of my superiors,

458
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:08,149
but I will share this information
to resolve your deep misunderstanding.

459
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:10,652
Yesterday's incident

460
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,154
was carried out
upon Her Royal Highness's order.

461
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:19,828
Is that true?

462
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:23,832
Why would I inform you of an obvious lie?

463
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:27,627
If you do not believe me,
you should ask Her Royal Highness.

464
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:29,045
Or…

465
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,965
shall I ask her on your behalf?

466
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:42,350
Your Majesty.

467
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,603
Do you have any other requests for me?

468
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,275
No.

469
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,945
I shall remember your warm words today

470
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,575
and keep them in my heart
until the end of my days.

471
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,470
You may leave.

472
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:22,348
You as well.

473
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:47,040
Life is so interesting.

474
00:42:47,874 --> 00:42:49,334
To think I live in a world

475
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,754
where a talent for a game can secure
a post and a superior's fondness.

476
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:54,422
Do you not agree?

477
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:58,509
You flatter me.

478
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:13,524
I wondered why His Majesty
was so smitten with a lowly <i>baduk </i>player.

479
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:16,736
I can see why after seeing you up close.

480
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,113
You are a man,

481
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:22,075
yet peculiar.

482
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:27,914
It is in His Majesty's nature

483
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:30,917
to take pity on those
who do not have friends or wealth.

484
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:33,002
Such was my case too.

485
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,881
He has treasured me since my days
as the Queen Dowager's court maid.

486
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:39,384
People may point fingers

487
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:42,762
at His Majesty and I
and condemn us for depravity,

488
00:43:42,845 --> 00:43:44,597
but that hardly matters.

489
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,016
The first man I gave my heart to

490
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,477
was His Majesty
back when he was a grand prince.

491
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,690
And he is well aware of that fact.

492
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:57,819
Do you understand what I mean?

493
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:00,196
His Majesty

494
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:04,033
may cast away a <i>gidaeryeong</i>
the moment he loses his interest.

495
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:07,161
But he can never cast me away.

496
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:11,416
Is that so?

497
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:15,837
Are you implying

498
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,590
that you do not believe my words?

499
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:22,593
I am His Majesty's senior court lady.

500
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:25,388
I can be appointed a concubine
whenever I wish.

501
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:29,100
I am not to be looked down upon

502
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:31,310
by someone of such low rank as you.

503
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,233
I did not intend to offend you, my lady.

504
00:44:37,817 --> 00:44:38,735
However,

505
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:43,865
I do not understand the reason

506
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:47,493
why you are explaining
His Majesty's heart to me

507
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,204
when you are so sure of his affection.

508
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,414
<i>What did you</i>

509
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:35,583
just say?

510
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:39,337
The Qing's vice envoy wishes to meet you,
Your Highness.

511
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,138
Tell him to come back later.

512
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,475
When His Majesty returns from the hunt,

513
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:54,268
I shall confirm his approval and--

514
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,478
I apologize,

515
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:58,356
but Her Royal Highness
has already approved it.

516
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:04,445
Tell him

517
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:06,781
to wait for a moment.

518
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,783
Yes, Your Highness.

519
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,960
Your Highness.

520
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:20,628
What am I to do?

521
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:43,484
Please follow me inside.

522
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,583
Your Highness.

523
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:11,712
I must deliver the gift
Prince Rui prepared for you.

524
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:14,631
Please allow me to see you.

525
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:18,344
All right.

526
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,074
I must say

527
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:43,118
it is a great honor

528
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:45,579
to see you myself, Your Highness.

529
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,540
These are the wedding gifts

530
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,626
from Prince Rui.

531
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:07,601
May I ask

532
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:09,937
what these are?

533
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:13,607
It is the bridal wear of the Qing royalty.

534
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,151
The moment
you dress yourself in that attire,

535
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:18,445
you will no longer be a princess of Joseon

536
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,615
and become the consort
of the Qing's regent.

537
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,660
Such an honor
will not come again to Joseon.

538
00:48:25,244 --> 00:48:27,246
I congratulate you once again.

539
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:33,794
Thank you.

540
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:53,480
Pretend today's meeting did not occur.

541
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,445
Yes, my lord.

542
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:06,702
Are you relieved now that
you have seen the Princess in person?

543
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:08,537
Of course.

544
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:13,542
Prince Rui will be very satisfied.

545
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:39,776
Earlier today, Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo

546
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,778
confirmed the Princess's visage.

547
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:46,658
How can that…

548
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:48,744
Keep walking.

549
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,129
This means

550
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,298
we cannot substitute her.

551
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:04,718
Thankfully, Bun-yeong
managed to think on her feet

552
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,888
and changed clothes with the Princess
before meeting Jung Je-pyo.

553
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:14,102
I wondered why you wanted her as your spy.

554
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,271
I can see why now.

555
00:50:18,106 --> 00:50:20,442
When is the envoy leaving?

556
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:22,694
In a few days.

557
00:50:23,195 --> 00:50:25,280
Has everything been prepared?

558
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:29,868
There is one last thing I must ascertain.

559
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:40,504
I am so full.

560
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,131
I cannot eat anymore, Mother.

561
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,051
Your stomach just might explode if you do.

562
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:54,768
I should get going
after saying my goodbye to Lady Hee-soo.

563
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,186
Wait one minute.

564
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:07,239
What is this?

565
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,037
Oh, my.

566
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:15,998
Is this not a waistband?

567
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:17,708
The embroidery is rather crude, no?

568
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:20,711
I told her I would do it,
but your mother insisted.

569
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:24,256
What kind of mother would let
somebody else prepare her child's things?

570
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:29,636
Mother.

571
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,265
Why is it so hard and heavy?

572
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,809
I put some silver coins inside.

573
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:42,482
They would weigh one <i>geun</i> at the least.

574
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,987
I told her your back would give in
if you wore that much weight on you,

575
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,780
but she would not listen.

576
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,952
I added a little extra
to your stipend so far.

577
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:57,456
I know it is heavy,
but wear it with you at all times.

578
00:51:58,165 --> 00:51:59,041
Who knows?

579
00:51:59,124 --> 00:52:00,751
It might come in handy.

580
00:52:09,384 --> 00:52:10,344
Mother.

581
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,388
I will wear it with me at all times,

582
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,433
even if my back breaks.

583
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,670
If you do not wish to do this,

584
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:45,921
you do not have to.

585
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,007
You can say you want to quit.

586
00:52:50,342 --> 00:52:51,802
If you refuse to do it,

587
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:54,596
I will not send you away.

588
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:00,769
My lady.

589
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:05,232
Do you know how overjoyed I was

590
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,902
when my birth mother passed away?

591
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,657
For as long as I can remember,

592
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,534
my mother always said

593
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:20,038
that she did not want to die
in the land of the outlanders

594
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:21,957
who ravaged our land
and killed her husband.

595
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:25,377
She said she wanted to die back home
even if it came to that

596
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,920
whenever she saw me.

597
00:53:29,715 --> 00:53:32,092
What we only dreamt of then became true.

598
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:37,180
I managed to bring my mother,
who was being abused by a violent master,

599
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,142
back to her motherland.

600
00:53:40,892 --> 00:53:43,311
I was also able
to look after her myself for a year

601
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:47,357
and let her pass away in peace.

602
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:52,946
All of that was possible
as you paid the ransom on our behalf.

603
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,119
It…

604
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:01,747
It was not my doing.

605
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:04,916
You did the deeds yourself.

606
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:12,549
I must undertake this task.

607
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,513
I have to do it for those
who died wrongfully like my parents

608
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:22,934
and for those who are still suffering.

609
00:54:23,935 --> 00:54:24,936
And I must do it

610
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:28,148
to prevent any more children

611
00:54:29,024 --> 00:54:31,401
from losing their parents
in the war like me.

612
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,279
I truly wish to do this.

613
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,041
I am

614
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,586
giving you too big of a burden.

615
00:54:54,633 --> 00:54:55,842
Do not worry.

616
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:58,512
I know I can handle this.

617
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:41,847
Princess.

618
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:44,766
Have you come to terms with this matter?

619
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:48,812
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:53,024
I apologize for worrying you.

621
00:55:58,613 --> 00:56:00,699
<i>Survive and return at all costs.</i>

622
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,286
I am your only elder brother,

623
00:56:05,745 --> 00:56:07,956
and you are my only younger brother.

624
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,335
Your injuries are my injuries.

625
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,048
So please return home safely.

626
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:22,762
Yes, Brother.

627
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:33,648
As…

628
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:35,692
the king of this nation

629
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,407
and as your uncle, my sins are too great.

630
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,122
Your Majesty.

631
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:51,708
The incident before happened

632
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,878
because I acted rashly

633
00:56:55,587 --> 00:56:57,047
from being overcome with fear.

634
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,758
As such,

635
00:57:01,468 --> 00:57:03,303
I want to say

636
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,350
that I hold no resentment toward you.

637
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:09,559
Do not worry.

638
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,563
I know too well

639
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,398
why you acted thusly.

640
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:18,652
I will not forget you for a moment

641
00:57:19,194 --> 00:57:21,863
and send word regularly
to see if you are well.

642
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:24,532
Do not worry about the Grand Prince

643
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:29,204
and be safe and sound.

644
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,166
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

645
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:36,294
Though I will be in faraway,

646
00:57:37,837 --> 00:57:39,464
I shall pray

647
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,758
for your health and long life

648
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:44,844
and the peace of this nation.

649
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:00,795
Stay seated.

650
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:03,214
Please let me bow to you, Sister.

651
00:59:09,554 --> 00:59:12,515
From this moment on,
you are my older sister.

652
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:03,608
Greetings, Your Highness.
I am Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan.

653
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:05,318
Minister of War Min Ji-hwan and I

654
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:08,321
will be escorting you out
upon His Majesty's orders.

655
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,078
Your Highness.

656
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:17,122
Please step into the palanquin.

657
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:21,126
Open the door.

658
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,161
As you are new here, you may stay.

659
01:00:57,412 --> 01:00:58,538
Yes, my lady.

660
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,349
You!

661
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:26,149
You brat, stop right there!

662
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:38,870
I told you to stop!

663
01:01:52,759 --> 01:01:54,469
Where on earth did she go?

664
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,436
Principal Director.

665
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:05,772
Thank you for your work.

666
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,857
It is all thanks to you,
Your Royal Highness.

667
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:18,785
I have returned, Your Royal Highness.

668
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:20,119
Welcome back.

669
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,455
Did the Princess leave
without any trouble?

670
01:02:23,122 --> 01:02:24,207
Yes.

671
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,626
I watched the palanquin leave.

672
01:02:37,262 --> 01:02:38,221
What is the matter?

673
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:41,516
Forgive me.

674
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,851
It may not be of any importance,

675
01:02:43,935 --> 01:02:46,271
but there is something
that weighs on my mind.

676
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:48,815
You may speak without hesitation.

677
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:54,696
One of the court maids
who served in the Princess's quarters

678
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:56,864
seems to have run away with her things

679
01:02:56,948 --> 01:02:59,117
instead of accompanying Her Highness.

680
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:02,787
What did you say?

681
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:05,331
- How ridiculous is that?
- When did that happen?

682
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:06,958
You startled me.

683
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,669
What is the matter, Principal Director?

684
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,296
I asked you when it happened!

685
01:03:11,379 --> 01:03:13,715
Well, it was…

686
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:14,716
It was…

687
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:18,720
Just who on earth is she
to make him act thusly?

688
01:03:18,803 --> 01:03:21,014
Surely one court maid going missing
is not that important.

689
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,521
Unless…

690
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,285
Principal Director.

691
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:46,581
Where did you smuggle her to?

692
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:51,169
I apologize,
but I do not understand your question.

693
01:03:51,252 --> 01:03:53,463
No confession without evidence,
is that it?

694
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:55,882
All right.

695
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,385
I will go see Princess Jangryeong
with my own two eyes.

696
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,099
Principal Director.

697
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:11,814
As my farewell to Princess Jangryeong
seems lacking in hindsight,

698
01:04:11,898 --> 01:04:13,524
I am meaning to go send her off.

699
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:15,735
Will you accompany me?

700
01:04:16,402 --> 01:04:17,278
Pardon?

701
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:19,822
Yes, my lord.

702
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:21,991
Surely I shall follow your command.

703
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:37,840
Why is the Principal Director
behaving so strangely?

704
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:40,051
Sending off the Princess out of the blue?

705
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:41,761
Please take these for me.

706
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:43,471
Wait…

707
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,431
Myung-ha.

708
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,977
My lord, where shall we head to?

709
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:51,896
They will have left
Mohwa Guesthouse already.

710
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:53,690
We should get ahead of her then.

711
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:55,733
- Let us head to Byeokjegwan.
- Yes, my lord.

712
01:05:20,925 --> 01:05:22,051
Your Highness.

713
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:26,055
Do you still feel distressed?

714
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,891
I feel guilty

715
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,977
for deceiving His Majesty.

716
01:05:46,951 --> 01:05:48,327
Can we speak in private?

717
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:50,788
What is the matter?

718
01:05:51,873 --> 01:05:54,584
It is about a request
I made of him earlier.

719
01:06:00,381 --> 01:06:01,883
What is this about?

720
01:06:04,552 --> 01:06:06,804
It seems like
the Principal Director caught on.

721
01:06:06,888 --> 01:06:10,099
He left just now to go see Her Highness.

722
01:06:30,495 --> 01:06:34,081
What brings you here, Lord Park?

723
01:06:34,165 --> 01:06:35,374
On Her Royal Highness's orders,

724
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,419
I am here to bid my farewell
to Princess Jangryeong.

725
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:42,131
After all those years
of you giving her the cold shoulder?

726
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:44,634
Wait here for a moment.

727
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:46,594
I shall ask her permission first…

728
01:06:46,677 --> 01:06:48,137
Lord Park! What insolence is this?

729
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:50,223
Great Lord, please calm down.

730
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:51,140
Move!

731
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:52,225
Stay still.

732
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,144
- You will hurt yourself.
- Your Highness!

733
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,987
Your Highness.

734
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,826
Her Royal Highness ordered me
to give you her final regard.

735
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:11,452
I apologize,

736
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,997
but I would like to speak to you
without the veil.

737
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,376
Will you please remove it for a moment?

738
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:27,134
Your Highness.

739
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:40,314
Your Highness!

740
01:08:24,358 --> 01:08:25,943
You are acting strange tonight.

741
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:28,738
It is not a difficult play,

742
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:32,783
so how come you are mulling over it
for such a long time?

743
01:08:34,994 --> 01:08:37,163
Could it be that you are feeling ill?

744
01:08:38,706 --> 01:08:42,001
No, I am fine, Your Majesty.

745
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,716
You are hardly fine with such a fever.

746
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:57,308
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

747
01:08:58,768 --> 01:08:59,769
Come in.

748
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,985
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan
seeks an audience urgently.

749
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:09,111
What shall I do?

750
01:09:10,363 --> 01:09:11,739
The hour is late.

751
01:09:11,822 --> 01:09:13,699
Tell him to come back tomorrow morning.

752
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,701
I apologize,

753
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:18,412
but he said the matter
requires your immediate attention.

754
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:22,959
All right.

755
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,211
I shall go to the hall of governance.

756
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,379
Yes, Your Majesty.

757
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,427
Let us stop here for today.

758
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,638
Go back home and rest.

759
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,397
Your Majesty.

760
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:51,904
I have an urgent matter to inform you of.

761
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,700
Must you tell me now?

762
01:09:58,953 --> 01:10:00,913
Your matter is of most importance to me,

763
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:04,375
but as you have heard,
the Principal Director is waiting.

764
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:11,549
It is regarding the matter
the Principal Director seeks to tell you.

765
01:10:16,595 --> 01:10:17,680
What is it?

766
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,774
What is the matter?

767
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,687
CAPTIVATING THE KING

768
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:08,397
<i>I must report to you
the treacherous subjects</i>

769
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,817
who dared to go against the royal command
and deceived you and the court.

770
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,277
<i>Substitution?</i>

771
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,487
Are you certain?

772
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,655
<i>Are you saying
you will take all the blame?</i>

773
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,741
<i>I have plotted everything.</i>

774
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:22,161
Did you expect me to forgive your crimes
because I am in love with you?

775
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,579
<i>My crime against you</i>

776
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:25,790
<i>does not render my love for you false.</i>

777
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:30,127
So it begins.

778
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:32,338
<i>Before I die,</i>

779
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,424
I wish to be of support
to the Grand Prince.

780
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,843
Do you know Lord Kang Hang-soon
by any chance?

781
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:41,764
<i>I will endure any sufferings
that may follow.</i>

782
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:45,469
