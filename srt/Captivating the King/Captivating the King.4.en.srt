11
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,060
I swear on the heavens…

12
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:27,859
that I have never plotted treason.

13
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:32,029
Do not defile the heavens' name.

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,449
It is treason in itself

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,411
to audaciously point a sword at me!

16
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,644
What do I have to do

17
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,272
to make you believe me?

18
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,245
Confess your crimes as the spy…

19
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:24,665
and take your own life.

20
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:32,757
Why?

21
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:34,842
Can you not do it?

22
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,513
Do you remember

23
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:43,976
what you said to me
before I was taken to Shenyang?

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,604
It has been years.

25
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,190
How am I to remember such a thing?

26
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:52,360
"Survive and return at all costs.

27
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,698
I will not forgive you

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,036
if you do not abide by this order.

29
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,627
I am your only elder brother,

30
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,381
and you are my only younger brother.

31
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:17,343
Your injuries are my injuries.

32
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,805
So please return home safely."

33
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,518
I must not have been myself back then,

34
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:30,398
seeing that I blabbered such lies.

35
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:34,110
There is no use
trying to hurt me with your words.

36
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,780
You have adored me since I was young.

37
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:41,242
And I know that better than anyone.

38
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:42,743
Yes, I did adore you!

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,540
That was the only way to escape
the persecution of the Queen Dowager

40
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,375
and keep myself safe

41
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,670
until I ascended the throne.

42
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,510
I…

43
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:03,514
have…

44
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:09,687
never loved you.

45
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:29,373
I…

46
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:36,797
have always loved you, Brother.

47
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:41,802
Have you decided to beg for your life
with such a transparent lie?

48
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:44,055
I cannot take my own life.

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,474
Please end my life with your own hands.

50
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,808
Fine!

51
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:51,354
If that is your wish,

52
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,026
I shall do so

53
00:04:57,818 --> 00:05:00,196
with my own hands.

54
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,242
Do not resent me.

55
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:09,121
You have brought this upon yourself.

56
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:12,249
Do not worry.

57
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,253
I will leave this world

58
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,757
with no resentment or grudge.

59
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:21,884
Please…

60
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,721
free yourself from captivation…

61
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,103
and become a virtuous king.

62
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:54,917
Brother!

63
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,919
Brother!

64
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:00,756
What is going on?

65
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:09,640
Did you drink the herbal medicine
that was not tasted?

66
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:18,816
Is anyone there?

67
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,862
Is there no one outside?

68
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:26,448
Did you call…

69
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:29,368
Your Majesty.

70
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,912
Bring the royal physician immediately!

71
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:32,997
Pardon?

72
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,956
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,833
Your Majesty…

74
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,435
<i>If…</i>

75
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:58,814
I die right now,

76
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,902
only one person…

77
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,200
stands to gain from it.

78
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:19,835
Earlier,

79
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,465
you told me…

80
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,388
that you have never plotted treason.

81
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,937
Can you swear…

82
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:44,235
that your words hold no shroud of deceit?

83
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,155
Yes.

84
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,449
I swear.

85
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,753
These are my last words.

86
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,423
Find…

87
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,928
the one who harmed me

88
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,390
and punish them.

89
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,268
And see to it

90
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:21,105
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

91
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,918
Do not…

92
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,714
Do not trust anyone.

93
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:50,634
No one…

94
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,220
Please…

95
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,810
preserve your energy, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:03,022
In…

97
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,781
My brother,

98
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:15,034
In.

99
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:21,999
I…

100
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,548
have…

101
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,393
Brother.

102
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:45,981
Brother.

103
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:49,443
Your Highness!

104
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:51,278
The royal physicians are here!

105
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,078
My brother has temporarily
lost consciousness.

106
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:01,163
Treat him immediately.

107
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,057
Why are you backing away?

108
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,226
Forgive me.

109
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,478
Please take my life instead!

110
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:28,774
Take your life?

111
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:31,944
What do you mean?

112
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,947
His Majesty…

113
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,617
has already passed.

114
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:08,147
Hongjang.

115
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:12,401
Please hang in there.

116
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,739
His Highness will save us no matter what.

117
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,826
Yes, my lord.

118
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,046
Your Highness.

119
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:28,769
I came running as soon as I heard the news
of His Majesty's passing.

120
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,743
<i>If I die right now,</i>

121
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,497
only one person…

122
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,545
stands to gain from it.

123
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:54,646
<i>These are my last words.</i>

124
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,066
Find…

125
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:02,571
the one who harmed me

126
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:06,074
and punish them.

127
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:08,869
And see to it

128
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,831
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

129
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:22,799
Your Highness.

130
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:26,678
I understand you are deeply distressed

131
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,431
about His Majesty's sudden passing.

132
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:33,977
But it was an inevitable event
as his chronic illness had been worsening.

133
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:38,482
My brother

134
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,526
was poisoned to death.

135
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,699
Who would have dared to commit
such an atrocious and treasonous act?

136
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,668
Tell me, who did it?

137
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,107
Now that the tiger is gone,

138
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,693
packs of hyenas will run wild.

139
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,362
They will reveal their indecent motives

140
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:28,156
and jump on you to rip your throat open.

141
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:37,124
Do you remember
what you told me last time?

142
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:41,420
By last time, do you mean…

143
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,046
You told me that ascending to the throne,

144
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:49,136
having the world at my command,
and governing this nation as its king

145
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:51,930
is my fate and to not deny it.

146
00:15:58,353 --> 00:15:59,479
I will

147
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:01,982
accept that fate.

148
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,235
A wise choice, Your Highness.

149
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,158
Let us head
to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

150
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,579
Your Highness.

151
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:17,956
Why are you hesitating?

152
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,124
Her Royal Highness's command

153
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,376
will not be enough
to convince Kim Jong-bae.

154
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:23,545
However,

155
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,923
there is nothing else we can do for now.

156
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,598
I must wipe off the blood first.

157
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:13,720
Forgive me, Your Highness.

158
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:58,890
Did His Majesty

159
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:02,144
leave any last words?

160
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:04,646
Please forgive me,

161
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,566
but I was not able to
stay by his side when he passed.

162
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,193
He passed unexpectedly.

163
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:12,571
No one could have kept his side
to receive his last words.

164
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:14,489
You are all wrong.

165
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:17,659
His Majesty did leave his last words.

166
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,664
Who is the subject
who received his last words?

167
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,125
It is me.

168
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,336
I received his last words.

169
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:33,300
His Majesty passed suddenly.

170
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,760
How could you have heard his last words?

171
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,019
It is thanks to you, Minister Kim.

172
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:47,939
I came to plead my innocence to him

173
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:50,483
and ended up receiving his last words.

174
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,197
So…

175
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:58,491
what were His Majesty's last words?

176
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:04,414
He entrusted me with the nation's future.

177
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:13,006
With the nation's future?

178
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,049
What…

179
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,176
could that possibly mean--

180
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,094
"Ascend to the throne."

181
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,767
"Protect and maintain peace
for the nation and its people."

182
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,116
Nonsense!

183
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,705
His Majesty could not have left
such lies as his last words!

184
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:46,998
How dare you?

185
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,543
How dare you suspect him?

186
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,003
His Majesty…

187
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:58,051
was wary of Grand Prince Jinhan
ever since his return from Shenyang.

188
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:58,969
And yet,

189
00:19:59,052 --> 00:20:01,179
his last words
were for a mere grand prince

190
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,306
to ascend to the throne
over the legitimate heir,

191
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,058
the Prince Royal?

192
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,103
The very Grand Prince
who is being suspected of being

193
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,396
the man behind the spy?

194
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,985
I was just as shocked
upon hearing his words.

195
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:19,239
However,

196
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,826
His Majesty

197
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:25,412
recognized my loyalty.

198
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,875
And his last thoughts were for the nation
and its people facing perilous times.

199
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:33,628
Thus,

200
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,214
he chose me

201
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:38,425
over the young Prince Royal.

202
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,139
Do provide evidence

203
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,558
that your words are true.

204
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,983
There is someone else
who heard the King's last words.

205
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,074
And who might that be?

206
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,162
Come in and tell them.

207
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,056
This is a sacred meeting.

208
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:29,142
Hence, you must not commit perjury.

209
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,854
Is it true that His Majesty left

210
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,815
his last words to the Grand Prince?

211
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,322
Yes, it is true.

212
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,417
I will ask again.

213
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,338
Think carefully before you answer.

214
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:01,800
Did you clearly hear…

215
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:05,804
His Majesty

216
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,265
command Grand Prince Jinhan

217
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,186
to be his successor

218
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,357
and ascend to the throne?

219
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,575
Yes.

220
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:30,662
I clearly heard His Majesty

221
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:33,581
give those very commands.

222
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,737
I swear to the heavens and the earth

223
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,616
that I received His Majesty's last words.

224
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,036
However,

225
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:18,543
I do not wish to ascend to the throne
against the court officials' will.

226
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,967
If even one person from the Royal Family

227
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,262
or any of the civil
and military officials oppose it,

228
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:32,056
I will not ascend to the throne.

229
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,038
You should not have said that.

230
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,541
Whether they are against you or not,

231
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,045
your reign was as good as secured
if Her Highness appointed you a successor.

232
00:24:02,128 --> 00:24:05,590
You have fallen into Kim Jong-bae's trap.

233
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:08,134
I spoke the truth

234
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:11,638
when I said I would not ascend the throne
should anyone oppose me.

235
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:14,349
If my sincerity fails to move them,

236
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:19,479
it will be pointless to claim the throne
even with my mother's help.

237
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:26,945
How did you win Court Lady Dong over?

238
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:38,665
Court Lady Dong.

239
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,750
Court Lady Dong.

240
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,046
Help me.

241
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,012
What…

242
00:24:55,223 --> 00:24:57,183
can I do for you?

243
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:03,606
If it had not been for you,

244
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:07,402
this nation would have fallen into crisis.

245
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,695
You praise me greatly,

246
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,990
but I have done nothing.

247
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,741
Is that so?

248
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:17,996
As the Grand Prince
has not ascended to the throne yet,

249
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,498
your apprehension is understandable.

250
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:46,024
Your Royal Highness, this is…

251
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,443
That <i>norigae</i> is awarded
to concubines only.

252
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:53,865
It is a token of appreciation
that I will not forget your contribution.

253
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:00,997
I am very grateful, Your Royal Highness.

254
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,710
I have looked into the herbal medicine

255
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:08,212
and the medicine pots of the Royal Clinic,

256
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,839
but I found no poison.

257
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:11,632
You better speak the truth.

258
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:13,634
Are you certain?

259
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,137
This concerns His Majesty!

260
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:18,431
How could I lie?

261
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:21,309
That is enough. You may leave.

262
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:38,159
It is clear that His Majesty
passed from his illness.

263
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,120
How naive.

264
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:43,664
Do you really believe him?

265
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:46,167
He is either bought off
by the Grand Prince

266
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,419
or siding with him
merely based on his words

267
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,964
that he received the King's last words
and voluntarily offering lies.

268
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:57,845
Do you also believe the Grand Prince
murdered the late king, Father?

269
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:01,557
The late king passed
as soon as I tried to uncover

270
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:03,393
the Grand Prince's crimes.

271
00:27:03,476 --> 00:27:05,603
Do you not find that odd?

272
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:08,731
We cannot accuse the Grand Prince
of crimes solely based on assumptions.

273
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,734
Why do you look so concerned?

274
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:14,445
He proclaimed himself

275
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:17,448
that he would not ascend the throne
should anyone oppose him.

276
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:18,741
We can simply oppose,

277
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:22,578
and that will prevent the Grand Prince
from taking the throne.

278
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:25,498
How foolish.

279
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:31,671
The Grand Prince
is more treacherous than a snake.

280
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:34,132
He would not have made such a promise
without a plan.

281
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,429
Shall I travel to Uiju
and meet with Jung Je-pyo?

282
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:41,514
To do what, exactly?

283
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:43,516
I would report to him

284
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,728
that Grand Prince Jinhan
is the one behind the King's death.

285
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,231
Do not tell me

286
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:53,734
you want to publicize
the murder of the King.

287
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,237
What if the Qing's court
uses it as a pretext

288
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,948
to deny the Prince Royal's
ascension to the throne?

289
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:00,533
In that case,

290
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:02,827
even if the Grand Prince keeps his word

291
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,204
and the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne,

292
00:28:07,748 --> 00:28:08,833
chaos will follow

293
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,335
for quite some time.

294
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,798
Forgive me for saying this,

295
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:21,012
but we may end up losing everything
trying to protect what is not yet ours.

296
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,431
That is simply what I was concerned about.

297
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:26,225
Leave such concerns to me.

298
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:27,935
As for you,

299
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:30,813
just carry out the tasks I give you.

300
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:35,818
Of course, my lord.

301
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:36,903
I shall do that.

302
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:47,371
I do not understand why you continue

303
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:50,750
to work with an untrustworthy
and despicable man like Yoo Hyun-bo.

304
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,418
Yoo Hyun-bo is a hound.

305
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,130
A hound that can bite off a tiger's neck.

306
00:28:56,672 --> 00:28:59,342
When it has served its purpose
after the tiger hunt,

307
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:05,056
I could just boil it and be done with it.

308
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,378
Minister Kim.

309
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:18,921
What is with these soldiers?

310
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,508
Per the mourning protocol,

311
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,635
these men will guard
the Royal Coffin Hall.

312
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:27,722
It is to prevent any uprising or revolt

313
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,892
that may happen.

314
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,481
It seems like you do not believe my words

315
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:41,068
that the King left his last words to me.

316
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:45,948
What kind of fool

317
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,326
would believe in such rubbish?

318
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:59,837
I need a subject
with clear insight, determination,

319
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:00,796
and…

320
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:04,842
a spirit of justice.

321
00:31:06,135 --> 00:31:08,137
Could you not confer your trust in me

322
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:11,349
for this nation and its people?

323
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,856
I would rather hang myself

324
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:23,027
than serve a wicked traitor.

325
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:27,323
You have willfully blinded
and deafened yourself

326
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:31,327
that you can neither see
nor hear anything.

327
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,037
That may be true.

328
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,996
However,

329
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:37,375
I have clearly seen and heard

330
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,627
your promise to the court officials.

331
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,880
You said even a single dissent

332
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:45,675
would be enough to renounce
your ascension to the throne.

333
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:47,927
I hope

334
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:50,262
you have not forgotten already.

335
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:51,597
I have not.

336
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:55,935
I will keep my word.

337
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:01,774
You will have no choice but to do so.

338
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:12,326
Mobilize troops immediately

339
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:14,704
to oppose Kim Jong-bae!

340
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,665
The soldiers that guard
the palace and the capital

341
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:21,043
only take orders from the Minister of War
and the Border Defense Council.

342
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:22,878
To oppose Kim Jong-bae,

343
00:32:23,462 --> 00:32:25,631
we must bring troops from the borders.

344
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:27,091
Why is that a problem?

345
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:30,219
I will send my command
to the commanders at the borders.

346
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,429
That will not do.

347
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:35,057
Why do you say so?

348
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:36,517
The security of the borders

349
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:39,353
maintains the safety
of this nation and the people.

350
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:42,773
We should not mobilize them
without a good reason.

351
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,191
If we do,

352
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:48,112
it will allow for an opening
for the Qing to strike us.

353
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:51,073
If our troops collide in the capital,

354
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,909
only innocent people will shed blood.

355
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:55,870
We cannot let that happen.

356
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:58,080
How can you be so frustrating?

357
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:02,293
Would you rather let them
stampede over you?

358
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:04,420
I have a plan,

359
00:33:06,338 --> 00:33:07,506
so please wait.

360
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,258
But before that,

361
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:10,885
I have

362
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:13,596
a favor to ask of you.

363
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,473
Of course.

364
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:17,933
You may ask me anything.

365
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:19,769
It is your eldest son

366
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:23,939
and the king of this nation
who has passed away.

367
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:27,026
Even if you do not mourn his loss,

368
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,236
please at least pretend

369
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:32,031
to express your sorrow.

370
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:46,754
All right.

371
00:33:49,298 --> 00:33:50,925
I shall express my sorrow.

372
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:52,551
In turn,

373
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,805
please respect my wishes.

374
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:21,205
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

375
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:34,343
The Prince Royal seems gaunt.

376
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:37,847
He is a precious asset
to this royal family.

377
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,682
Though he may be the chief mourner,

378
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,852
take care of him so he does not fall ill.

379
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,272
I will keep that in mind,

380
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:48,357
Your Royal Highness.

381
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,121
I kept my promise.

382
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:04,081
It is your turn now.

383
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,507
I heard you have a task for me.

384
00:35:18,971 --> 00:35:20,431
What might this be?

385
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:25,102
It is a letter the Grand Prince
is sending to the troops at the border.

386
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:27,146
You must return before <i>seongbok</i>.

387
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:28,397
SEONGBOK: WEARING A MOURNING DRESS.
ASCENSION FOLLOWS AFTER SEONGBOK.

388
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,690
Can you manage it?

389
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:31,025
Do not worry.

390
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:34,195
I will return with the troops

391
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,614
even if it costs me my life.

392
00:36:00,262 --> 00:36:02,014
Min Ji-hwan is trying to
mobilize the troops

393
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:04,516
from the northwestern border
under the Grand Prince's order?

394
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,143
Are you certain of it?

395
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:07,519
Yes, my lord.

396
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:12,066
I saw Min Ji-hwan riding north on a horse
with my own two eyes.

397
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:16,946
After all that song and dance
about his love for the people,

398
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:20,824
he wants to shed blood in the capital?

399
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:23,202
Before the Grand Prince takes action,

400
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:25,579
we should tighten the screw
on that <i>baduk </i>gambler

401
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:28,040
to force a confession out of him.

402
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,835
Do you think you can get him to confess?

403
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:35,047
Of course, consider it done.

404
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,926
We must strike the Grand Prince
before Min Ji-hwan returns with troops,

405
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:41,303
so get his confession promptly.

406
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:43,597
Yes, my lord.

407
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,234
Father.

408
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:57,945
Did you not hear
what that <i>baduk </i>gambler said?

409
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:00,281
It is evident Yoo Hyun-bo
lied out of sheer spite

410
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:02,700
to frame the Grand Prince
as the man behind Chu Dal-ha.

411
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:05,119
It does not matter.

412
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:09,748
We just need Grand Prince Jinhan's name
mentioned in the confession.

413
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:10,833
That <i>baduk </i>gambler

414
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:14,461
will not give you the confession you want.

415
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,714
When all his limbs are broken,

416
00:37:17,214 --> 00:37:18,799
and blood rises like bile,

417
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:21,218
he will sing like a canary.

418
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:27,850
Father.

419
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,314
Then please

420
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,399
let me handle his interrogation.

421
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:38,694
How odd of you.

422
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:39,945
Why do you care so much

423
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:42,573
about a mere <i>baduk </i>gambler?

424
00:37:45,784 --> 00:37:47,661
I cannot trust Yoo Hyun-bo.

425
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:48,704
I will do it instead.

426
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,832
I will get his confession no matter what.

427
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,751
So please leave this to me.

428
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:23,030
That is enough. You may leave.

429
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,340
Are you breaking your promise
to Grand Prince Jinhan?

430
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:46,303
That promise is meaningless now.

431
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:50,057
His Majesty has passed away.

432
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,269
When the warden returns,

433
00:38:54,353 --> 00:38:55,938
the interrogation will begin.

434
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,022
Before that happens,

435
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,650
I will give you the chance to attest.

436
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:00,567
If you do,

437
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:04,530
you and Hongjang
will both leave this place alive.

438
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:08,784
And what am I supposed to attest to?

439
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,541
Name Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,

440
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,877
as the real man
behind the spy, Chu Dal-ha.

441
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:22,297
Say so when the warden is present.

442
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:25,175
- Then--
- I must have a discerning eye for people.

443
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:33,142
I have disliked you from the moment
you started frequenting my house.

444
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,311
You started placing stones
on the <i>baduk</i> table

445
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,313
without ever fathoming
your opponent's feelings.

446
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,025
That is when I first knew
that you would not be reliable.

447
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,861
I do not want to take it this far.

448
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:46,280
But it is not the time
to pick apart right and wrong.

449
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:48,407
I am not upset because this is wrong.

450
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,494
You prey on my desperation and force me
to perjure myself for personal gain.

451
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,204
That is what disgusts me.

452
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,220
Do you not want to save Hongjang?

453
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,515
Do you want to die in humiliation

454
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:16,310
after they find out that you are a woman?

455
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,398
I am afraid and scared of dying.

456
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:25,444
However, committing a crime
that would never wash away to save myself

457
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:28,071
frightens me a thousandfold and more.

458
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,327
Hongjang would say the same.

459
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,197
My lord, shall I start the interrogation?

460
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,704
Lay a finger on him,

461
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:20,082
and I will have you dead.

462
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,543
Do you understand me?

463
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:24,294
Yes, my lord.

464
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:30,300
Just as expected.

465
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:35,472
It would be better for me to step in.

466
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,895
Do you think I do not see through
your scheme for your grudge

467
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:45,148
to have him killed
under the pretense of interrogation?

468
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:52,698
Do you realize he could hold out
and refuse to attest?

469
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:54,199
Let me worry about that.

470
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,909
Do not meddle.

471
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:17,014
<i>It does not matter.</i>

472
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:21,935
<i>We just need Grand Prince Jinhan's name
mentioned in the confession.</i>

473
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:39,286
Father. It is Min Ji-hwan
of the Ministry of War.

474
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:41,622
What could have happened?

475
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:43,498
He could not be back
from the borders already.

476
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,086
Something is not right, Father.

477
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:50,422
No need to be scared.

478
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:52,507
We have the confession.

479
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:55,677
Grand Prince Jinhan
will be dragged out as a criminal

480
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,430
charged with high treason

481
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:00,724
with all the officials watching.

482
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:28,043
Soldiers!

483
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:32,881
Arrest Yi In
for treason against the crown!

484
00:43:32,964 --> 00:43:34,007
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

485
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:54,945
Do you have evidence
that I have committed treason?

486
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:59,157
This is a confession

487
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:02,119
that names Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,

488
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:03,745
as the man behind Chu Dal-ha!

489
00:44:04,413 --> 00:44:05,664
Let me see that.

490
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:14,506
"The <i>baduk </i>gambler attested

491
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,133
that the spy, Chu Dal-ha,

492
00:44:16,883 --> 00:44:20,971
received an order from Grand Prince Jinhan
to travel to the Ming."

493
00:44:21,763 --> 00:44:24,391
"He also attested
that it was to inform the Ming

494
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:27,561
that the Qing would strike them soon."

495
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:29,771
- Goodness.
- A spy?

496
00:44:29,855 --> 00:44:33,150
- Did he truly commit such an act?
- Is this true?

497
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,902
So he was the real spy?

498
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:37,821
We cannot have a traitor

499
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:41,199
ascend to the throne!

500
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:43,869
Do you not agree?

501
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:50,083
You have created a crime
that I have not committed

502
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:53,712
solely to prevent my ascension.

503
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:54,796
It is truly…

504
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,133
impressive.

505
00:44:58,216 --> 00:45:00,051
So you will play innocent, I see.

506
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:03,638
There is someone who can attest
that the confession was forged.

507
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:08,935
Tell me.

508
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,979
Who might that be?

509
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:14,399
It is me,

510
00:45:14,983 --> 00:45:16,067
my lord.

511
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:27,245
I was ordered by Kim Jong-bae,
the Minister of War,

512
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:32,334
to falsify a confession
about Grand Prince Jinhan.

513
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:35,378
He said that would allow him
to eliminate the Grand Prince

514
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:37,714
by framing him as a spy.

515
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:40,175
When I refused to do so,

516
00:45:40,258 --> 00:45:44,304
his son, Kim Myung-ha,
conspired with the <i>baduk </i>gambler

517
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,765
and got a fake confession out of him!

518
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:49,017
Father.

519
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,810
That man is lying.

520
00:45:50,894 --> 00:45:53,271
Yoo Hyun-bo's words are all lies!

521
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:56,274
Shall we go to the <i>baduk </i>gambler

522
00:45:56,358 --> 00:45:59,194
and check if I am speaking the truth?

523
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:02,072
That is…

524
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:04,366
How dare you try to defame His Highness

525
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:06,493
with a forged attestation?

526
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,995
<i>This</i> is treason!

527
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,832
Immediately arrest
Kim Jong-bae for treason!

528
00:46:18,922 --> 00:46:20,173
You bastard!

529
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:23,385
Since when were you

530
00:46:24,344 --> 00:46:26,388
in league with the Grand Prince?

531
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:38,358
I warned you, did I not?

532
00:46:38,984 --> 00:46:42,279
I told you that you may end up
losing everything

533
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:46,157
trying to protect what is yet to be yours.

534
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,827
Drag the traitor out!

535
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:07,429
Father.

536
00:47:08,054 --> 00:47:09,139
I am fine.

537
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:25,280
If you admit to treason

538
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:27,282
and beg for forgiveness,

539
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,828
I will not execute you.

540
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:39,502
You said you would not take the throne
if even one person from the Royal Family

541
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:42,547
or any of the civil
and military officials opposed it.

542
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:49,137
No wonder.

543
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:51,556
I knew you had something up your sleeve.

544
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:57,354
You made such a promise
knowing this would happen.

545
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:02,942
You are truly a wicked and treacherous--

546
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:13,912
Father.

547
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:21,252
Father.

548
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:30,136
- Father…
- Drag the traitor out.

549
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,888
- Yes, my lord!
- Father.

550
00:48:35,058 --> 00:48:36,184
Father!

551
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:38,978
Father!

552
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:42,232
Father!

553
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:46,695
Father!

554
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,669
Is there anyone else
who opposes my ascension…

555
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:07,382
to the throne?

556
00:49:08,383 --> 00:49:09,843
I, Oh Wook-hwan,
Third Minister of Taxation…

557
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:12,929
dare plead with you, Your Highness!

558
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,306
Please ascend to the throne,

559
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,600
preserve the Royal Family and the nation,

560
00:49:17,684 --> 00:49:22,021
and protect the land and its people!

561
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,442
I, Min Ji-hwan, Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of War,

562
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:29,529
also beg that you uphold
the last words of the late king!

563
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:33,783
Please uphold
the last words of the late king!

564
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:37,245
- Please uphold his last words!
- Please uphold his last words!

565
00:50:39,432 --> 00:50:42,101
Hail the King!

566
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:44,979
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

567
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:48,858
Hail the King!

568
00:50:48,942 --> 00:50:51,653
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

569
00:50:52,403 --> 00:50:54,697
All hail our King!

570
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,909
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

571
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:03,122
As His Majesty inherits the throne,

572
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:06,251
the Royal Family
and the nation are at peace!

573
00:51:06,793 --> 00:51:09,087
May you be blessed with great happiness

574
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,882
of the nation prospering under your reign!

575
00:51:13,383 --> 00:51:17,136
- May you be blessed with great happiness!
- May you be blessed with great happiness!

576
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:25,812
His Majesty declined our offer back then

577
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:28,398
not out of fear but to test us.

578
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,400
Have you realized that just now?

579
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,028
Mock me all you want.

580
00:51:34,612 --> 00:51:38,408
However, even you could not have foreseen
that His Majesty would win over

581
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:40,743
Yoo Hyun-bo
who was Minister Kim's underling.

582
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:42,453
Am I wrong?

583
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:03,850
Make your request to His Highness.

584
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:07,437
I only have one wish.

585
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,900
It pertains to the <i>baduk</i> gambler
and his gang in league with the traitor.

586
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,777
Please punish them severely.

587
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:21,335
Mother!

588
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:23,963
- Mother!
- Mother!

589
00:52:24,047 --> 00:52:26,924
- Mother!
- Jangryeong!

590
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:29,427
- Mother!
- You must stay at Prince Royal's side!

591
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,388
Jangryeong!

592
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:34,807
Jangryeong…

593
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,075
You killed my brother

594
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:55,620
and brought ruin to my family.

595
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:58,414
Do you intend
to kill the Prince Royal as well?

596
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:02,627
No one

597
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:07,006
will dispose of or seek to punish
the Prince Royal without my permission.

598
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:12,553
What do you want?

599
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,223
Leave to Jeongeopsa Temple.

600
00:53:19,435 --> 00:53:21,646
Are you telling me
to join the Buddhist order?

601
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:23,439
Pray for my brother's eternal life

602
00:53:24,357 --> 00:53:26,984
and your children's wellness
for the rest of your life.

603
00:53:27,068 --> 00:53:28,402
That is the way

604
00:53:28,486 --> 00:53:29,862
to ensure that both you

605
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,074
and the Prince Royal survive.

606
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,330
What will you do?

607
00:53:52,468 --> 00:53:54,053
I have a condition.

608
00:53:58,015 --> 00:53:59,725
It is about my nephew, Kim Myung-ha.

609
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,105
Spare him.

610
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:20,413
"Kim Myung-ha shall serve
as an Executive Assistant in Uiju."

611
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:33,759
The situation in Uiju seems very dire.

612
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:35,553
Make your journey without any delays.

613
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:39,432
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:55:00,411 --> 00:55:01,537
Why are you here?

615
00:55:02,538 --> 00:55:03,664
To see you off.

616
00:55:04,457 --> 00:55:06,584
I guess you were going to leave
without seeing me.

617
00:55:08,586 --> 00:55:09,420
Why?

618
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:14,634
Did your brother tell you to find out
the real intent behind my meek acceptance?

619
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,677
How could you be so…

620
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,597
Gosh, it makes me sad.

621
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:21,807
Do not scorn our long friendship--

622
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:25,394
A traitor's son cannot befriend
a meritorious subject's son.

623
00:55:28,564 --> 00:55:30,358
You do not sound like yourself.

624
00:55:30,441 --> 00:55:31,776
You are right.

625
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,238
I am a changed man.

626
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:40,952
I hear the executive assistant of Uiju

627
00:55:41,035 --> 00:55:43,496
is an extremely demanding position.

628
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:46,457
Please stay safe.

629
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:49,752
Do not worry.

630
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,005
I will survive and return.

631
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,877
It felt like the Grand Prince was here.

632
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,506
Was it a dream?

633
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:24,263
Here comes His Majesty!

634
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:32,146
Here comes His Majesty!

635
00:57:38,527 --> 00:57:41,947
Here comes His Majesty!

636
00:57:45,743 --> 00:57:49,413
Here comes His Majesty!

637
00:58:19,402 --> 00:58:21,821
Pay your respects to His Majesty!

638
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,039
You may raise your heads.

639
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:53,978
Your Majesty.

640
00:58:54,478 --> 00:58:56,480
Please issue your verdict
on these criminals

641
00:58:56,564 --> 00:59:00,568
who colluded with vile traitors

642
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:03,487
and attempted to harm you
with false attestations.

643
00:59:05,781 --> 00:59:07,324
A false attestation?

644
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:10,870
That is not true, Your Majesty.

645
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:14,165
I have not given any attestations,
be it true or false.

646
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:15,458
Shut your mouth.

647
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:16,751
Why are you standing about?

648
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,627
Have the criminal on his knees!

649
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:35,644
Criminals shall listen.

650
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,398
You colluded with a band of traitors

651
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:42,026
and threatened the nation and its people
by falsifying attestation.

652
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:44,695
Such crimes are serious and grievous.

653
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:46,322
Thus,

654
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:49,700
though we are still in mourning
for the late king's passing,

655
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:52,495
I order the judges

656
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:55,873
to discuss this matter,
agree on a punishment,

657
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:00,461
and have it carried out
without any delays.

658
01:00:15,476 --> 01:00:16,727
A moment, please.

659
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:18,395
Your Majesty.

660
01:00:19,855 --> 01:00:21,357
Please spare me a second.

661
01:00:23,943 --> 01:00:24,985
Your Majesty!

662
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:26,529
Stand back.

663
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:29,406
Your Majesty.

664
01:00:30,574 --> 01:00:32,117
Please spare Hongjang's life.

665
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:34,745
Hongjang did not say a word.

666
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:35,996
So please,

667
01:00:37,122 --> 01:00:38,624
spare her life.

668
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,378
This is the final request
of your <i>manghyeongjiu</i>.

669
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:56,642
I am no longer an ordinary man.

670
01:00:57,643 --> 01:00:58,978
I am the king of this nation.

671
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:00,646
A king

672
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,816
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

673
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:07,570
He keeps no such thing as friends.

674
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:16,871
<i>Father.</i>

675
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:21,333
<i>What kind of a person
is Grand Prince Jinhan?</i>

676
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:25,379
He was born with the talent and authority

677
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,840
to rule and command the world.

678
01:01:29,216 --> 01:01:30,301
And that makes him…

679
01:01:33,095 --> 01:01:35,264
a target and a threat.

680
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:40,269
Not only that,
his life is sad and pitiful.

681
01:01:41,395 --> 01:01:45,441
<i>He was fated to ascend to the throne
despite not being able to do so.</i>

682
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:48,152
<i>Despite his loyal heart,</i>

683
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:52,156
<i>treacherous men will flock to him
like moths to a flame.</i>

684
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:57,244
<i>Do not worry, Father.</i>

685
01:01:58,787 --> 01:01:59,747
<i>His Highness</i>

686
01:02:01,415 --> 01:02:03,667
<i>is not someone
who will be swayed by such people.</i>

687
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,557
Move!

688
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:23,771
- Hurry!
- Move!

689
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:26,398
- Walk faster!
- Move it!

690
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:33,447
- Walk faster!
- Hurry!

691
01:02:35,741 --> 01:02:37,952
<i>The criminals who colluded
with treacherous Kim Jong-bae</i>

692
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:40,037
<i>to give a false attestation</i>

693
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,207
<i>shall be flogged 100 times
and be sentenced to 3 years of hard labor.</i>

694
01:02:43,707 --> 01:02:45,834
<i>The criminals must walk to the border,</i>

695
01:02:45,918 --> 01:02:47,878
<i>so the flogging
shall be carried out later.</i>

696
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:07,606
Hongjang.

697
01:03:08,941 --> 01:03:10,234
Are you okay?

698
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:37,803
I am sorry.

699
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:42,558
This is my fault.

700
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,603
Why would you

701
01:03:48,188 --> 01:03:49,648
say such a thing?

702
01:03:53,986 --> 01:03:55,320
Because it is.

703
01:03:58,449 --> 01:03:59,825
This is all my fault.

704
01:04:04,913 --> 01:04:05,914
I would rather…

705
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,334
you spoke your usual.

706
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:13,047
What?

707
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,341
Say…

708
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:18,802
bollocks.

709
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,931
Come on.

710
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:29,021
Bollocks.

711
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,691
Bollocks, indeed.

712
01:04:33,317 --> 01:04:34,902
Damn it, bollocks.

713
01:04:36,779 --> 01:04:37,905
Bollocks.

714
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,002
It will only take a day and a half more

715
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,129
to get to our destination.

716
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:58,175
I will make sure to get you a physician.

717
01:05:00,094 --> 01:05:01,595
So hang in there until then.

718
01:05:03,597 --> 01:05:04,681
Okay?

719
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:59,695
- All right. Wake up already!
- Hey!

720
01:05:59,778 --> 01:06:02,072
- We have a long way to go!
- Wake up!

721
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:03,448
Wake up!

722
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:04,908
- Get up!
- Wake up!

723
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:06,910
- Wake up!
- I told you to get up!

724
01:06:06,994 --> 01:06:07,911
Wake up!

725
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:16,044
Hongjang.

726
01:06:16,128 --> 01:06:18,172
- We still have a long way to go!
- Wake up!

727
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:20,549
- Get up now.
- Wake up!

728
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:25,554
Hongjang.

729
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:27,431
Wake up, Hongjang.

730
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:23,028
No, this cannot be.

731
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:29,284
You cannot pass away like this.

732
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:36,667
No…

733
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:43,840
Please…

734
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,517
Damn it.

735
01:09:18,018 --> 01:09:19,978
Why are you being such a nuisance?

736
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:28,403
Get him!

737
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:30,989
Stop right there!

738
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:35,702
Stop!

739
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:40,290
Stop!

740
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:14,282
Is he dead?

741
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,702
Even if he is not, he will not last long.

742
01:10:17,786 --> 01:10:18,995
Let the tigers finish him off.

743
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:55,824
<i>The scent of blood, sweat, and tears
of the innocent people of Joseon…</i>

744
01:10:56,658 --> 01:10:58,076
pervades the wind there.

745
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:03,623
I vowed to myself on the day
I smelled that wind for the first time.

746
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,334
That I would survive and return to Joseon

747
01:11:06,418 --> 01:11:09,588
and serve the people and the nation
until the day I die.

748
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:10,672
That I will not…

749
01:11:12,799 --> 01:11:15,135
let such tragic events happen ever again.

750
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:28,190
<i>I swear on my father and Hongjang.</i>

751
01:11:30,358 --> 01:11:32,027
<i>I will survive and return</i>

752
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:35,614
<i>and make him feel</i>

753
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:41,119
<i>the pain of being betrayed
by the person he trusted.</i>

754
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:44,080
<i>He will be made</i>

755
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:47,334
<i>to suffer this indignity.</i>

756
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,922
<i>I will make sure that he never forgets…</i>

757
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:56,718
<i>the scent of the blood of the innocent.</i>

758
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:16,821
3 YEARS LATER

759
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,252
What does it say?

760
01:12:30,335 --> 01:12:32,337
Hold on.

761
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,422
They are looking for a <i>gidaeryeong</i>

762
01:12:34,506 --> 01:12:38,260
who will join His Majesty
at Yeongchwijeong for <i>baduk</i>.

763
01:12:38,343 --> 01:12:39,970
GIDAERYEONG: THE KING'S BADUK INSTRUCTOR

764
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:41,846
Anyone may apply
regardless of their class.

765
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:42,889
Look at that.

766
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:45,225
Or their age, for that matter.

767
01:12:46,309 --> 01:12:47,769
Regardless of class?

768
01:12:48,645 --> 01:12:49,813
The world has gone crazy!

769
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:56,695
- Keep reading.
- All right.

770
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:02,534
"Anyone who knows how to play <i>baduk</i>
may apply to an examination."

771
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:07,581
"However, public officials
are not qualified to do so."

772
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:12,460
I did not expect
the King to be such a fair man.

773
01:13:16,298 --> 01:13:17,591
Fair, my foot.

774
01:13:17,674 --> 01:13:19,175
He did not mention female applicants.

775
01:13:19,259 --> 01:13:22,345
He spent three years indulging in
drinks and women day and night.

776
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:24,431
Maybe he has gotten tired of them.

777
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:27,475
By the way, Yeongchwijeong?

778
01:13:28,977 --> 01:13:30,604
What is that place for?

779
01:13:57,172 --> 01:13:58,840
Any applicants for my <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

780
01:13:59,883 --> 01:14:03,094
Everyone is surprised
at the high number of applicants.

781
01:14:03,178 --> 01:14:05,096
Have them hurry.

782
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:09,309
I am sick and tired…

783
01:14:11,436 --> 01:14:13,855
of playing alone.

784
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:25,909
State your name.

785
01:14:26,576 --> 01:14:27,702
It is An Gong-hyeop.

786
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,624
- Your name.
- Seo Hyeok-pil.

787
01:14:36,586 --> 01:14:37,629
Name.

788
01:14:37,712 --> 01:14:39,422
Lee Jeong-hyeon.

789
01:14:40,256 --> 01:14:41,216
What is your name?

790
01:14:41,299 --> 01:14:45,720
- Kim Nam-su.
- Kim Nam-su. There we go.

791
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:51,976
State your name.

792
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:53,937
Mong-woo.

793
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:56,523
My name is Kang Mong-woo.

794
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:08,952
"Mong-woo"?

795
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:10,954
What characters do you use?

796
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,957
<i>Mong</i>, meaning "drizzle"

797
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:15,792
and <i>woo</i>, meaning "rain."

798
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:26,094
KANG MONG-WOO

799
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:39,542
CAPTIVATING THE KING

800
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:42,086
<i>What will you do now?</i>

801
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:44,297
Are you ready to risk your life?

802
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,426
I have been ready ever since I etched
my vow to my heart three years ago.

803
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,970
<i>Revive the peach tree in the Royal Garden.</i>

804
01:16:51,054 --> 01:16:52,806
<i>If you fail to do so,</i>

805
01:16:52,889 --> 01:16:54,766
you shall be punished severely.

806
01:16:55,558 --> 01:16:58,394
<i>It appears that many people
have long waited for my death.</i>

807
01:16:58,478 --> 01:17:00,939
<i>I would like to appoint a </i>gidaeryeong.

808
01:17:01,523 --> 01:17:02,899
<i>What do you think?</i>

809
01:17:03,733 --> 01:17:06,569
<i>What do you mean
by going against the King?</i>

810
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,448
<i>I have returned to bring down the King
who tricked his way onto the throne</i>

811
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:12,700
<i>by fooling the world
with his wicked wiles.</i>
