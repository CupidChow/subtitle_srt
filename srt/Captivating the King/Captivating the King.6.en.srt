11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,101
You have returned

12
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,603
to get revenge.

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,315
You harbor treasonous ambition
of murdering me, no?

14
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,409
<i>Saengbulyeosa.</i>

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,455
You have survived,
yet you are no better than the dead.

16
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,249
What will you do now?

17
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,461
Answer me
with that wicked tongue of yours.

18
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,671
What will you do?

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,056
Are you suddenly lost for words?

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,683
Why are you not answering me?

21
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,562
Say something.

22
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,023
Your life depends on
that despicable tongue of yours.

23
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,739
Upon hearing your words,

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,283
I must dare to ask.

25
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,537
Why do you suspect me of treachery?

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,963
Because you lost
your beloved friend, Hongjang.

27
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,968
Because despite your desperate pleas
to spare her life,

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,597
I chose not to save her.

29
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,565
<i>If one examines closely,</i>

30
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,652
one will always find a way
to save a cornered stone.

31
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,869
The moment you said that

32
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,915
one could always save a cornered stone
by examining it closely,

33
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,500
I deciphered

34
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,670
your motive behind returning before me.

35
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,590
Can you deny
that it is not for a treacherous intent?

36
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,267
It is true that I treasured Hongjang,

37
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,353
but my life is of greater value to me.

38
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,022
Unless one has gone mad,

39
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,566
no one would dare
brew such intent over a single loss.

40
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,527
A friend who trusts and relies on you.

41
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,280
A friend you want to
and must protect at all costs.

42
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:21,243
The kind of friend
that gives your life meaning.

43
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,330
If such a friend loses their life
to a wrongful death,

44
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,711
one may go mad.

45
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:40,220
I did not expect you
to acknowledge her wrongful death.

46
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,684
Hongjang's spirit in the Underworld
will be shedding tears of joy.

47
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,229
If you want to live,
examine closely before answering.

48
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,898
That way, you will see a way
to save yourself.

49
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,153
If you still doubt my sincerity,

50
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,155
then kill me right this moment.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,907
<i>I</i> will decide to choose
where and when to kill you.

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,120
My apologies.

53
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,958
I had forgotten for a moment

54
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,044
that you have already
chosen my death once.

55
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,754
Do not ever forget that.

56
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,259
You are dead to me.

57
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,221
I can have you killed whenever I wish,
and it would be a child's play.

58
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,306
Do you understand?

59
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,564
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,776
I will remember your words.

61
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,329
EPISODE 6

62
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,291
Is Mong-woo still in Yeongchwijeong?

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,170
He should be going home soon.

64
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,714
Surely they are not playing
on the first day, are they?

65
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,593
Are you leaving?

66
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,929
Let us wait and leave with Kang Mong-woo.

67
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,765
A feast may be too much,
but a celebratory drink will do.

68
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,975
A celebratory drink?

69
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,854
Are you trying to bribe him
to your side already?

70
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,064
My goodness.

71
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,816
Do you think so little of me?

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,900
It is not bribery…

73
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,444
but forging friendship.

74
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,947
That is a suitable expression.

75
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,533
He became the <i>gidaeryeong </i>thanks to me.

76
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,118
Can I not hope for this much?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,161
Do you not agree?

78
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,083
Do not get too close to Kang Mong-woo.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,169
What do you mean?

80
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,720
What a random thing to say.

81
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,524
My gosh.

82
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,735
You said <i>baduk</i> is shared
between two players,

83
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,657
and the two should only converse
through their stones.

84
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,701
Those words

85
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,580
reminded me of the day
when I first played against you.

86
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,833
I was so immersed in playing with you…

87
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,796
that I did not even realize
it had begun to rain.

88
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,998
I have not enjoyed such an immersion
since I ascended to the throne.

89
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,251
All of my companions

90
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,088
were scheming vipers
bent on reading my mind

91
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:06,092
to use that as leverage
for their personal gain.

92
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,470
So how am I to believe

93
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,556
that you are different from them?

94
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,186
What can I do

95
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,147
to alleviate your suspicion?

96
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,900
Please advise me how.

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,116
I will be your patron.

98
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,461
Countless people
will come to you to win your heart.

99
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,007
The court officials,
members of the royal family,

100
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,928
and the ladies in and out of the palace
will attempt to curry favor with you.

101
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,056
They may flaunt their power to coax you,

102
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,226
offer you an unfathomable fortune,

103
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,436
or tempt you with an incomparable beauty

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,398
that would easily melt any man's heart.

105
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,864
Does simply imagining these things
make you happy?

106
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,826
No man can resist

107
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,123
power, wealth, and beautiful women.

108
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,547
If you want to win my trust,

109
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,592
you cannot be swayed by anything.

110
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,218
Do not think to deceive me.

111
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,638
The moment I find any deceit,

112
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,810
the Captain of the Special Firearms Unit,
Joo Sang-hwa, will have your head.

113
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,862
Of course, Your Majesty.

114
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,718
Do you have something to say to me?

115
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,472
No.

116
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,496
I am here to serve
herbal medicine to His Majesty.

117
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,831
Give it to me.

118
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,376
- I shall give it to him.
- Stand back, Captain Joo.

119
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,211
It is my duty

120
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,879
to serve him herbal medicine.

121
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,049
It may be so in the King's quarters,

122
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,134
but not here in Yeongchwijeong.

123
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,261
As you are aware,

124
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,598
only a select few may enter Yeongchwijeong
per the King's orders.

125
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,017
So this random nobody can enter the place,

126
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,729
but I, His Majesty's loyal servant,
am barred from entering?

127
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,315
That is correct.

128
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,707
How dare you?

129
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,751
Are you stopping me
from carrying out my duties?

130
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,380
I am merely carrying out
the royal command.

131
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,299
Your duties are none of my concern.

132
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,305
The herbal medicine will go cold.

133
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,921
Her glare was sharper than any blade.

134
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,673
Even I was holding my breath.

135
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,176
Seeing how she tried to force her way in
with the herbal medicine,

136
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,470
Court Lady Dong
must have been intrigued by you.

137
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,430
But then again,

138
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,432
you may become His Majesty's confidant.

139
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,517
No wonder she was curious about you.

140
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,978
By Court Lady Dong, you mean…

141
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
Your guess is correct.

142
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,149
She served the late king
and now serves the current king.

143
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,236
She seemed to have bad blood with the
Captain of the Special Firearms Unit.

144
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,238
How could she not?

145
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,658
She is the reason the whole nation
is pointing fingers at His Majesty

146
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,743
for being depraved.

147
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,414
As Captain Joo's duties include regulation
and management of the rumors,

148
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,625
she is a big nuisance to him.

149
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,835
I see.

150
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,006
I must say, I would feel deeply wronged
if I were Court Lady Dong.

151
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,884
His depravity
is through no fault of her own.

152
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,512
Do you not agree?

153
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:01,846
What?

154
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,142
Are you a good drinker, by any chance?

155
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,520
Forgive me.

156
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,522
Having spent days preparing for the games

157
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,524
without sleeping or eating properly,

158
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,025
my energy is depleted.

159
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,861
I must return home immediately
and get some rest.

160
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,988
Then forget about tonight.

161
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,865
How about tomorrow?

162
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,745
My duty from now on
is to be at His Majesty's beck and call.

163
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,165
Thus, it would be difficult
to arrange a schedule in advance.

164
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,129
If you will excuse me.

165
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,179
I shall see you tomorrow.

166
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,017
Goodness.

167
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,279
What do you think of Mong-woo?

168
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,075
I find it suspicious that a traitor
would return of his own accord.

169
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,327
I have ordered my men to tail him

170
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,746
and look into his dealings
for the past three years.

171
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,914
Until then,

172
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,792
please refrain from admitting him here
and keep an eye on him.

173
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,713
He lived well enough
without ever disclosing his real name.

174
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,592
Even if your men searched
every nook and cranny of this nation,

175
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,843
they would not be able to find

176
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,222
a trace of a man named Kang Mong-woo
that matches his description.

177
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,018
May I ask why you have
let him enter Yeongchwijeong

178
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,855
though you are aware
of his questionable background?

179
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,733
It is entertaining.

180
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,653
It is clear as day
that this post will bring him doom.

181
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,114
And yet, he feigns joy

182
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,035
and stands before me
as if he is unaware of the fact.

183
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,454
Do not make that face.

184
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,707
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Whatever may have prompted his return,

185
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,543
I will not let him sway me.

186
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,716
Report to me immediately
even at a hint of suspicious activity.

187
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,884
Do you understand?

188
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,177
Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,221
What about the other matter?

190
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,017
As you ordered, I have arranged a meeting
before the <i>gisinje</i>.

191
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,143
GISINJE: MEMORIAL SERVICE
FOR THE KING OR THE QUEEN'S DEATH

192
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,269
Good work.

193
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,480
You may leave.

194
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,814
Yes, Your Majesty.

195
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,382
"The <i>gidaeryeong </i>is as good as chosen."

196
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,550
Did you not assure me so?

197
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,844
Yes, I did.

198
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,765
My men were referred to
as masters of calculation and <i>baduk</i>.

199
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,143
You said it was as easy as Guan Yu
beheading the leader of his enemies.

200
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,062
What will you do now?

201
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,065
Please do not be enraged
over such trivial matters.

202
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,901
It does not matter
who became the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

203
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,779
We still have the most certain option.

204
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,825
Summon Kang Mong-woo
and make him an offer.

205
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,119
Just as Prince Deokseong did,

206
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,746
Kang Mong-woo
will not refuse your patronage.

207
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,749
As if the King would be happy
learning that I summoned him!

208
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,669
Have you forgotten how he banished

209
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,671
the First Senior Consort?

210
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,840
It is not that complicated.

211
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,635
You can summon him in secret
while His Majesty is away.

212
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,513
I will

213
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,765
arrange a meeting.

214
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,736
Gosh, my lord!

215
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,198
Why are you coming home so late?

216
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,367
We have already cleaned the pot.

217
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,245
I hurried over to be in time for dinner.

218
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,997
Am I too late?

219
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,957
Of course you are.

220
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,461
We already finished
every single grain of rice there was.

221
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,920
There is no helping it then.

222
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,005
Do not worry about me.

223
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,507
By the way,

224
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,635
how did your work go today?

225
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,679
The <i>baduk</i>.

226
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,474
I won.

227
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,521
You should have led with that!

228
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,398
Jageunnyeon!

229
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,109
Put the pot on the fire again!

230
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,194
All right!

231
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,264
<i>I will return to save you.</i>

232
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,143
Do not worry and wait. Do you understand?

233
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,448
As you did not return
past the expected hour,

234
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,951
we got jumpy and even considered
barging into the palace.

235
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,744
My goodness! My lady!

236
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,788
My lady!

237
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

238
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,881
Please spare Hongjang's life.

239
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,135
Hongjang did not say a word.

240
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,386
So please,

241
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
spare her life.

242
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,392
This is the final request
of your <i>manghyeongjiu</i>.

243
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,027
I am no longer an ordinary man.

244
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,947
I am the king of this nation.

245
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,115
A king

246
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,118
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

247
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>He keeps no such thing as friends.</i>

248
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,905
I guess you understand
the gravity of your sin.

249
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,409
I do not care what nonsense
comes out of your mouth.

250
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,870
Lady Hee-soo cannot go back to the palace.

251
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,082
- Jageunnyeon.
- Stay still.

252
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,585
I am going to explode
if you provoke me further.

253
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,880
We will all regret it if we stop here,
including her, me, and even you.

254
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,798
Bollocks.

255
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,384
Regret it or not,
my feelings are none of your concern.

256
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,470
Enough, both of you.

257
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,058
I only fainted from
staying out in the sun for too long.

258
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,518
It will not happen again. I promise.

259
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,649
You need to take your herbal medicine,

260
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,942
so keep the talk short.

261
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,954
He threatened to kill you
if you sought a patron?

262
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,998
That must be why the King
had Prince Deokseong killed.

263
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,292
I wonder who his patron was.

264
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,671
Surely it was Park Jong-hwan,
the Principal Director.

265
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,799
Had it been Oh Wook-hwan or Min Ji-hwan,

266
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,218
they would have died
along with Prince Deokseong.

267
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,262
Park Jong-hwan is his uncle

268
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,472
and has his mother's support.

269
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,100
Thus, he only killed
Prince Deokseong as a warning.

270
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,936
It is a warning not to have
the Queen Dowager as your patron.

271
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,438
The Queen Dowager and Park Jong-hwan

272
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,732
will propose an offer
you will not be able to refuse.

273
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,193
And if you do,
they will find whatever fault they can

274
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,528
and exploit it to harm you.

275
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,114
The King foresaw this
and issued an empty threat

276
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,615
under the pretext of suspicion.

277
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,909
It was not an empty threat.

278
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,664
He said I was already dead to him

279
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,043
and that killing me
would be a child's play.

280
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,636
I tried to take the initiative,

281
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,099
but I neglected the fact that
the King was a skillful tactician.

282
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,269
I let my guard down
when he promised to spare my life.

283
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,355
He outplayed me right then and there.

284
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,318
Do not beat yourself up.

285
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,529
It is only the start.
We have a ways to go.

286
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,451
I must reassess.

287
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,671
KANG MONG-WOO

288
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,457
Your Majesty.

289
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,418
What has you so deep in thought?

290
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,130
It is nothing.

291
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,427
Your Majesty, I have a request.

292
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,971
What is it?

293
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,352
Please grant me access to Yeongchwijeong.

294
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,148
Do you not know
what kind of a place Yeongchwijeong is?

295
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,404
I am well aware
that you established the place

296
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,907
to play <i>baduk </i>in peace
without any interference.

297
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,744
I will provide you with extra comfort
should you grant me access.

298
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,704
Please grant me your approval.

299
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,833
I will not.

300
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:15,876
However, Your Majesty--

301
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,962
I already gave you my answer.

302
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,093
Your Majesty.

303
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,679
Have you perhaps

304
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,557
forgotten the promise you made to me
three years ago?

305
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,060
I cannot handle

306
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,229
such an important duty.

307
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,607
I shall grant your request

308
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,401
no matter

309
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,195
what it may be about.

310
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,867
I believed in your words back then

311
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,618
and risked my life for you.

312
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,203
And I continue to do so even now.

313
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,459
Have I ever forsaken that promise?

314
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,589
Have I ever not granted your request?

315
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,757
No, not even a single time.

316
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,760
Thus,

317
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,056
I have no doubt
that you will grant my request this time.

318
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,358
Fine.

319
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,530
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

320
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
However,

321
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:35,206
I have clearly stated
to the court officials

322
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,209
that only talented <i>baduk</i> players
may enter Yeongchwijeong.

323
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,461
As I cannot make an exception for you,

324
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,256
I shall grant you entrance
when your skill has become proficient.

325
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,052
But Your Majesty.

326
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,639
Captain Joo has access to Yeongchwijeong

327
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,140
despite his ignorance in <i>baduk</i>!

328
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,058
Sang-hwa…

329
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,939
carries his sword around.

330
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,826
If you feel wronged,

331
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,787
challenge him in a fight and win.

332
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,042
Is anyone outside?

333
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,215
Yes, Your Majesty. Did you call for me?

334
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,301
As I skipped today's afternoon study,
I shall have nighttime study.

335
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,262
Summon the Nightshift Royal Secretary.

336
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,638
I shall, Your Majesty.

337
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,194
Your Majesty.

338
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,322
Did you use me as an excuse
to Court Lady Dong again?

339
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,034
She requested access to Yeongchwijeong,
so I had no choice.

340
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:59,164
You are the best excuse
that I can use against her.

341
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,711
Has Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
come to the palace yet?

342
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,087
He has not.

343
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,757
Order him to come to Yeongchwijeong
as soon as he does.

344
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,758
Your Majesty.

345
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,052
You have a morning assembly
at the hall of governance today.

346
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,304
Right.

347
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,764
Order him to be there
as soon as the assembly is over.

348
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,932
I will, Your Majesty.

349
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,085
You may await His Majesty's orders here.

350
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,171
Could you do me a favor?

351
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,756
Please speak.

352
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,176
This is the list of officials
awaiting promotion.

353
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,804
You shall write up
their official appointment letters.

354
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,431
Yes, my lord.

355
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,494
<i>So it seems Yoo Hyun-bo
will be returning to the court after all.</i>

356
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,122
Where are the petitions for His Majesty?

357
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,681
Did I not order you to remove this one?

358
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,433
My lord.

359
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,977
This pertains to an urgent matter
at the border region.

360
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,605
I believe it should be
reviewed by His Majesty.

361
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,233
It is against our treaty with the Qing

362
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,068
to repair collapsed fortresses.

363
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,612
An envoy from the Qing will be here soon.

364
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,240
If the matter causes a diplomatic issue,

365
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,492
will you take responsibility?

366
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,080
However, His Majesty should be informed.

367
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,541
Do you think he is in the dark?

368
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,795
Do not be pompous
and lay low as if you were dead.

369
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,882
Never forget that
there are people ready to drag you down.

370
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,093
Do you understand?

371
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,096
Yes, my lord.

372
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,520
What is it?

373
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,105
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>
has asked for a <i>baduk</i> table.

374
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,273
What shall I do?

375
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,817
You take care of it.

376
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
Gather the petitions and follow me.

377
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes, my lord.

378
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,035
I did not expect you to come yourself.

379
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,831
Did you not ask for a <i>baduk </i>table
to see me?

380
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,916
Even if that had been my intention,

381
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,543
you could have chosen not to come.

382
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,465
Why did you return?

383
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,553
Was the pain from three years ago
not enough?

384
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,930
If you wish to discuss
the pain I experienced then,

385
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,641
you should ask for my forgiveness first.

386
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,686
You forged an attestation
that I had never given.

387
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,024
I do not need

388
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,526
your forgiveness.

389
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,196
I only did what I had to.

390
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,533
You have become rather brazen.

391
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,953
I must say that it is quite a relief.

392
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,626
To go against the King who has mastered
all trickery and deception,

393
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,170
such brazenness would be necessary.

394
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,968
What do you mean

395
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,221
by going against the King?

396
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,559
You asked why I have returned.

397
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,022
I have returned to bring down the King
who tricked his way onto the throne

398
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,859
by fooling the world
with his wicked wiles.

399
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,696
I shall offer you an opportunity as well.

400
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,117
The opportunity to get revenge
on the enemy who slayed your father.

401
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,038
Will you join hands with me?

402
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,895
I thought you might have run away in fear
after our conversation last night.

403
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,192
Is that why you ordered
the Special Firearms Unit to follow me?

404
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:49,320
It would be a waste to lose
my precious <i>baduk </i>opponent, would it not?

405
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:53,574
Do not be concerned.

406
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:56,994
I will not run away of my own volition,

407
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,956
not unless I die or am expelled.

408
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,917
That means there is something
you want from me.

409
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:04,544
What is it?

410
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,425
As you are aware,

411
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,970
I only play <i>baduk</i> when there is a bet.

412
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,564
You dare to suggest
a game of <i>baduk </i>gamble?

413
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:27,442
If you win,

414
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,236
you may decide my fate
however you see fit.

415
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,904
If I win,

416
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:34,574
I beg you to grant me a wish,
whatever that may be.

417
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:38,828
You want me to retract my promise of death
should you get a patron?

418
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,164
Your Majesty,

419
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:45,001
I will not beg you to spare my life.

420
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,762
It all sounds like
I would be losing out greatly.

421
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:04,437
All right.

422
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,564
I shall approve of your proposal.

423
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,316
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:19,160
It would not be proper to withdraw
all the stones for a fresh game, would it?

425
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,707
You should have
made your proposal earlier.

426
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,958
My apologies.

427
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:39,388
<i>So…</i>

428
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:41,224
who won?

429
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:44,894
As we played while calculating
10 to 20 moves ahead of each other,

430
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:46,562
the game did not progress much.

431
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,773
It will take a few days at the least
to see who wins.

432
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,737
Will Kim Myung-ha join hands with you?

433
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:57,990
It will take a few days for him as well.

434
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,493
What about Yoo Hyun-bo?

435
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,955
We must get payback for Se-dong.

436
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:08,167
Go collect all his winnings
and leave nothing behind.

437
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:18,970
Hey.

438
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:21,889
Why do we not
leave this much as their cut?

439
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:24,976
The order was to collect everything.

440
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,227
Everything?

441
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,022
All right then.

442
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,781
Hold on now.

443
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,074
Where are you guys off to?

444
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,034
Damn it. Did I not tell you?

445
00:32:42,118 --> 00:32:43,953
I said we needed to give them their cut.

446
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,179
Halt.

447
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,398
What is going on?

448
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:15,735
These lowly bastards were being shameless,

449
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:18,070
so I was teaching them some manners.

450
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,659
Who are you

451
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,662
- to teach them manners or fault them
- My lord.

452
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:28,497
- for being shameless?
- My lord…

453
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:34,378
What are you staring at? Get lost.

454
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:43,763
Let us leave. Come on.

455
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,442
Man-bok was right to cut in.

456
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:58,402
Why did you let those lowly brats go?

457
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:02,239
I did not want to let them go either.

458
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:04,533
Then why?

459
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:06,702
Do not tell me that
it was because of the onlookers.

460
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:08,871
Were you worried your promotion
would be withdrawn

461
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,331
if the Special Firearms Unit
were to find out?

462
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,125
My lord.

463
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:18,631
Why do you think those brats
placed their bets on Kang Mong-woo?

464
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:19,799
What do you mean why?

465
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,509
They just got lucky.

466
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,473
They placed their bets
knowing he would win.

467
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:28,849
And how would they have known?

468
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,311
As they work for him.

469
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:38,025
Do you now understand why I let them leave
with their lives intact?

470
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:42,029
Do you mean you did so
to win Kang Mong-woo's favor?

471
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,156
Still, it was too much.

472
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,909
Is it not a waste
to give them all that fortune?

473
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:49,245
Why would you think that is a waste?

474
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:52,415
Once you become Kang Mong-woo's patron,

475
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:57,044
you can make him cough up 10 times,
or even 20 times the amount.

476
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:01,090
That is easier said than done.

477
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:04,385
In return for your efforts
to bring me back into the court,

478
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:09,306
I will bring Kang Mong-woo
and make him kneel before you.

479
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,769
Have a drink.

480
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:17,273
By the way,

481
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,360
did you ever commit
a discourtesy to the Principal Director?

482
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:24,989
He made up all kinds of excuses
to go against your promotion.

483
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:28,200
I barely got his approval
only after spending a hefty sum.

484
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:32,830
I can only wonder in question

485
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:34,707
at his disapproval of me.

486
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,974
Principal Director, have you been well?

487
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:55,102
We have not conversed in a long time.

488
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,314
I wish to visit you often
to seek your counsel.

489
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,861
Since you speak of my counsel,
I shall offer one for you.

490
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,237
Please do.

491
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:08,324
Your promotion

492
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,367
was only approved
thanks to the Great Lord's plea,

493
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:13,370
despite your performance review being
marked out by His Majesty multiple times

494
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:16,373
to be reinforced for further inspection
and disciplinary actions.

495
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,876
If you get caught by the
Special Firearms Unit and dismissed,

496
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,087
the Great Lord will be in a pickle.

497
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:22,421
Therefore,

498
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,841
you had better sever ties
with your indecent business.

499
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:28,552
I am referring to the gambling den.

500
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:33,390
I will heed to your words, my lord.

501
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:56,372
Just ignore him.

502
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:02,670
Myung-ha.

503
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:17,309
Even the lowest Royal Secretary
must enjoy some prestige.

504
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,813
You look very well indeed.

505
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:38,038
Such cheek from a mere traitor's son.

506
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:52,720
Where are you going?

507
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,015
I am on my way to Yeongchwijeong.

508
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,850
Why do you ask?

509
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:04,106
Yoo Hyun-bo has returned to court
as the Third Minister of Rites.

510
00:38:05,357 --> 00:38:06,692
If you go this way,

511
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:08,444
you will run into him.

512
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,656
I have no reason to avoid him.

513
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,875
No one avoids feces out of fear.

514
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,168
One does so because of its filth.

515
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:29,048
There is another route to Yeongchwijeong.

516
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:30,299
Follow me.

517
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:44,897
This must be that famous peach tree.

518
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,026
The tree that the late king planted
with His Majesty in mind.

519
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:54,406
Reviving it would be a challenge indeed.

520
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,915
Head straight this way,
and you will find Yeongchwijeong.

521
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,626
You have not given me an answer yet.

522
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,379
It is best to stay silent
to a ridiculous proposition.

523
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,257
Please reconsider.

524
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,677
My answer will not change,
even if I do reconsider a thousand times.

525
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:17,429
What is the reason?

526
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,354
Since you are being deliberately obtuse,

527
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:27,106
I shall point out the flaws clearly.

528
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,775
The goal that you dream of

529
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:32,820
is difficult to achieve
even with a just cause, suitable means,

530
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,989
and a blessing from the heavens.

531
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,075
Why would I risk my life

532
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,244
for something that will clearly fail?

533
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:45,165
While I cannot move the heavens,

534
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:50,045
if I prove to you that I have the plan
and means to reach my goal,

535
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,423
will you trust me?

536
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,179
I shall arrange an audience

537
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,640
with Grand Prince Munseong
and Princess Jangryeong.

538
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:08,397
You would need approval
from Her Royal Highness to that end.

539
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,816
Do you think she will grant her approval

540
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,651
when I am a thorn in her side?

541
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:15,821
Furthermore, even if she did,

542
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:18,324
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan
would not sit back.

543
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:20,909
You can wait and see.

544
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:27,958
Here comes His Majesty!

545
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:45,476
Your Majesty.

546
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,688
What are you doing here?

547
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:52,274
We were on our way to Yeongchwijeong.

548
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:54,610
With so many inquisitive eyes
on the <i>gidaeryeong</i>--

549
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:57,321
Hold your tongue.
The question was for Mong-woo.

550
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:03,369
As I have not yet mastered
the ins and outs of the palace,

551
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:06,914
the Sixth Royal Secretary was aiding me
to find my way to Yeongchwijeong.

552
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,082
How amusing.

553
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,962
You dared to enter Yeongchwijeong
when I did not even summon you?

554
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:17,716
I had not thought it through.

555
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:20,886
I beg your pardon for my foolishness.

556
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,137
I do not want to see you.

557
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:24,390
Go and wait for my command.

558
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,809
As you wish, Your Majesty.

559
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,277
I see it now.

560
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:39,405
The two of you conspired

561
00:41:40,406 --> 00:41:43,575
and had Kang Mong-woo
apply to become the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

562
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:46,703
That is not true, Your Majesty.

563
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,956
Until I was ordered to play
<i>baduk </i>against him

564
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,582
at Chundangdae upon your command,

565
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,334
I did not even know he was alive.

566
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,379
You once boasted about
your close friendship with him.

567
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,215
There was a time

568
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,677
when I sought to
become close to Kang Mong-woo.

569
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,138
However, ever since
the incident three years ago,

570
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,765
I had long forgotten him and moved on.

571
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:10,102
As for Kang Mong-woo,
I am certain he has a grudge against me.

572
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:11,186
And…

573
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:14,523
you do not have any grudge against him?

574
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:19,445
Despite my unforgivable crime,

575
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:20,988
you have shown me great kindness

576
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,490
by sparing my life
and giving me a government post.

577
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,911
My only wish is that
bygones can be bygones.

578
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,420
Have you found a way to save the tree?

579
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,551
I have made countless inquiries
and found a few promising ways.

580
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:43,469
And?

581
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:46,638
Some suggested replacing the soil,

582
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:49,683
and others suggested
replanting the tree in fertile land.

583
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:51,268
What shall I do?

584
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:54,146
You may not replace the soil

585
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:57,024
or replant the tree elsewhere.

586
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:00,986
Find another way.

587
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:02,571
Yes, Your Majesty.

588
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,529
Has His Majesty summoned me
to Yeongchwijeong?

589
00:43:43,612 --> 00:43:44,821
No, my lord.

590
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,448
He commanded you to return home.

591
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,769
Your Majesty.

592
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,230
An urgent matter requires your attention

593
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:20,190
regarding your travel for the <i>gisinje</i>.

594
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:21,483
My ears are open.

595
00:44:21,984 --> 00:44:23,860
I apologize for saying this,

596
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,863
but many offices have petitioned
for the reduction of the troops

597
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,658
to be mobilized for the said event.

598
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:37,499
Do not generalize and state clearly.

599
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,294
Who discussed what and where?

600
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:46,466
During a meeting at the Ministry of War,

601
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:50,304
some raised concerns about the high number
of troops being mobilized for the event.

602
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:02,107
What do you mean high?

603
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,610
Some may suspect

604
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:08,030
that you are inspecting the troops
under the pretense of traveling.

605
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:11,658
That is what the Ministry of War
is concerned about.

606
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,204
And who would dare raise such suspicion?

607
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:20,250
The Qing's envoy is arriving soon.

608
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,130
"Do not do anything that may arouse
suspicion from the Qing's envoy."

609
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:27,257
Is that what you are implying?

610
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:28,300
Your Majesty.

611
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,094
That is not what I meant to convey--

612
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,805
What else did they say about the matter?

613
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:40,187
Your Majesty.

614
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,897
I apologize,

615
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,692
but the cost of your travel rises
in proportion to the number of troops.

616
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,737
The officials at the Ministry of Taxation
also warned

617
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,074
that the costs might not be met
without levying a tax for your journey.

618
00:45:55,577 --> 00:45:56,703
The purpose of my travel

619
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:59,581
is for the first <i>gisinje</i> of the late king

620
00:45:59,664 --> 00:46:01,500
after the three-year mourning period.

621
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,627
If we cut the number of troops,

622
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,422
the people will think
that I lack honor for the late king.

623
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:10,550
Thus, the offices' petition
will not be granted.

624
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:11,468
However,

625
00:46:12,427 --> 00:46:14,638
I will ride a horse
instead of a royal palanquin.

626
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:18,934
I will reduce the number of officials
and court ladies in attendance as well.

627
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:21,103
The officials traveling with me

628
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:23,605
shall do the same.

629
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:27,317
Would that soothe your concerns?

630
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:32,322
What a wise answer, Your Majesty.

631
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:34,908
We will follow your commands.

632
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,118
I am done here.

633
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:40,455
Everyone here shall shoot an arrow
before they leave.

634
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,457
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:46:50,048 --> 00:46:51,174
I mean,

636
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,093
what is so bad about placating the Qing?

637
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:56,096
Why would he rage over a petition
seeking to prevent trouble?

638
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:59,891
I cannot seem to wrap my head around
what His Majesty is thinking.

639
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:04,729
His Majesty is placating the people,
not the Qing.

640
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:06,648
The people?

641
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:08,525
Despite Joo Sang-hwa's efforts,

642
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,944
the rumors about His Majesty
continue to spread across the land.

643
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:13,029
The public sentiment will only worsen

644
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,282
if they find the <i>gisinje</i> lacking.

645
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:17,742
How could he not get enraged

646
00:47:17,826 --> 00:47:19,494
to see his court stirring up trouble?

647
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,121
Principal Director.

648
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:24,166
What do you think about
Minister Min's opinion?

649
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,711
Let us speak in privacy, Great Lord.

650
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:35,427
You have enraged him
with your nonsense, Minister Min.

651
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,061
Pardon?

652
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,106
But that is…

653
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,232
Why?

654
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,318
Can you not do it?

655
00:47:53,695 --> 00:47:54,696
Of course I can.

656
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:56,823
I will speak to Her Majesty.

657
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:00,160
Then I shall convey this
to Her Royal Highness.

658
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:11,338
You want me to summon
Kang Mong-woo, the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

659
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,466
His Majesty would be furious
if he were to find out.

660
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:17,761
I cannot do it.

661
00:48:18,303 --> 00:48:20,013
I have nothing to ask of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

662
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:21,515
Father.

663
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,100
If you want to become
the patron of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,

664
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:25,727
please find another way.

665
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:26,978
Your Majesty.

666
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,607
I would not have brought it up
if that had been the case.

667
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:33,109
Is it…

668
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,695
the Principal Director's command?

669
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:38,156
No,

670
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,700
it must be Her Royal Highness's command.

671
00:48:43,912 --> 00:48:46,164
She could just summon him
to her quarters instead.

672
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,047
It is to avoid His Majesty's wrath
when he finds out.

673
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,883
They need a scapegoat.

674
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,679
They only sent you to me
to prevent me from telling His Majesty

675
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:03,723
that Her Royal Highness is behind it
like the First Senior Consort did.

676
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:04,683
Am I wrong?

677
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:05,934
Your Majesty.

678
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:10,730
Just consider this your duty
as a daughter-in-law to prevent discord

679
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:13,191
between a son and his mother.

680
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:38,300
You have been waiting for this,
have you not?

681
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,176
Thank you, as always.

682
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:42,137
It is nothing.

683
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,557
What about the herbal medicine
for Her Majesty?

684
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:47,642
It will be ready soon.

685
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,774
Her Majesty takes herbal medicine?

686
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,901
Her chronic migraine has come back.

687
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:01,031
- What happened?
- Is it not obvious?

688
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,951
Her Royal Highness is forcing her
to carry out a distasteful task.

689
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:07,829
She was forced to do so
when the First Senior Consort was exiled.

690
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:11,875
She went to plead with His Majesty
upon Her Royal Highness's orders

691
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,543
and earned his ire for no reason.

692
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,847
I will skip the morning assembly today
and inspect the Directorate of Training.

693
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,475
- Lead the way.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

694
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,672
His Majesty is away
to visit the Directorate of Training.

695
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,342
Tell the Queen
to carry out my order today.

696
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:04,010
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

697
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:38,837
<i>I am writing to you
as an urgent matter came to my attention.</i>

698
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,631
<i>Last night,
Her Majesty's illness worsened.</i>

699
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:43,341
<i>According to the female physicians,</i>

700
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:45,927
<i>it is due to Her Royal Highness.</i>

701
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,598
Gidaeryeong Kang,
Her Majesty has summoned you.

702
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:58,231
<i>As you have told me to send word
should Her Royal Highness make a move,</i>

703
00:51:58,314 --> 00:51:59,983
<i>I send you this letter just in case.</i>

704
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:05,697
Your Majesty.

705
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,199
Gidaeryeong Kang is here.

706
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:10,785
Let him enter.

707
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,441
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
at your service, Your Majesty.

708
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:47,155
Please wait.

709
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,949
The person you should
offer your services to

710
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:50,992
will be here shortly.

711
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:53,578
Your Majesty.

712
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:55,246
Forgive me,

713
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,832
but you seem distressed.

714
00:53:00,168 --> 00:53:01,294
You have keen eyes.

715
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,546
I <i>am </i>distressed.

716
00:53:06,508 --> 00:53:09,010
I have a way to rid you of your concern.

717
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,138
Would you like to hear it?

718
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,559
Just how would you know what concerns me?

719
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,896
Is it not because Her Royal Highness

720
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,108
is coming to your quarters to see me
while His Majesty is away?

721
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:28,154
How did you know?

722
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:32,492
His Majesty has left the palace
on purpose.

723
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:34,911
When Her Royal Highness comes to see me,

724
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:38,498
His Majesty will rush here
at that very moment.

725
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:41,459
What…

726
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:43,002
What could I do?

727
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,046
At this rate,

728
00:53:45,129 --> 00:53:47,465
His Majesty's wrath will be upon me.

729
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:50,093
I have an idea.

730
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,220
We have no time,

731
00:53:52,303 --> 00:53:54,889
so allow me to ask a few questions
before I share my idea.

732
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,975
Ask me anything.

733
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,207
Your Majesty, Her Royal Highness is here.

734
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,830
Is the Grand Prince inside?

735
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:38,499
Grand Prince Munseong
left for the Royal Garden earlier.

736
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,168
Do you know where he is
in the Royal Garden?

737
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:44,296
Gidaeryeong.

738
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,215
You may raise your head.

739
00:54:54,431 --> 00:54:55,808
My goodness.

740
00:54:58,018 --> 00:55:02,606
How come no one told me
he was such a fine-looking young man?

741
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:04,233
My apologies.

742
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,403
It was my first time seeing him today,

743
00:55:07,486 --> 00:55:08,737
so I could not inform you.

744
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,323
I was not talking to you, Your Majesty.

745
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,993
Just stay silent.

746
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:15,995
I apologize, Your…

747
00:55:17,538 --> 00:55:18,372
Royal Highness.

748
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:24,336
You may sit comfortably, Gidaeryeong.

749
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,131
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Royal Highness.

750
00:55:31,844 --> 00:55:34,096
I am told that you are
exceptional at <i>baduk</i>.

751
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:36,515
I hear His Majesty is quite satisfied.

752
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,810
Tell me, how does it feel
being the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

753
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:42,479
Some may praise my skill,

754
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,857
but it is nowhere close to His Majesty's.

755
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,360
I head to Yeongchwijeong daily
hoping to learn from him.

756
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:54,325
I finally understand
why His Majesty is so fond of you.

757
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:56,410
I apologize,

758
00:55:56,493 --> 00:55:58,704
but I am unsure of his affections.

759
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:01,081
He has not summoned me
for the past few days.

760
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:04,418
If he does not like someone,
he does not hesitate to exile them

761
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:06,545
and never sees them again.

762
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:07,838
I believe

763
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:11,133
he is in the process of molding you
into the companion of his liking.

764
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,722
Your words are putting my heart at ease,
Your Royal Highness.

765
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:18,891
Is that so?

766
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:22,061
Then we should see each other often.

767
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:27,983
I would like to

768
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:32,655
become a dependable patron for you.

769
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:34,531
What do you say?

770
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:39,620
I am very grateful,

771
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:42,748
but the offer is excessively generous.

772
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:44,583
It is not excessive.

773
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,418
Do not read too much into it.

774
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:49,004
As it is something I cannot handle,

775
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:51,340
I must beg you to withdraw your offer.

776
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,971
How dare you decline
despite my repeated requests?

777
00:56:58,138 --> 00:57:00,599
I wonder why you are being so arrogant.

778
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:02,476
Tell me.

779
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:05,562
Here comes His Majesty!

780
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,418
Welcome, Your Majesty.

781
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:37,177
Do not walk away.

782
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:42,141
Did you just return to the palace?

783
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,351
It is quite disappointing

784
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:47,730
to learn that you would come here
before visiting my quarters first.

785
00:57:47,813 --> 00:57:49,481
I went to your quarters first

786
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,608
and came here
as the court ladies directed me.

787
00:57:52,484 --> 00:57:55,070
What brings you all the way
to the Queen's quarters?

788
00:57:58,032 --> 00:58:01,285
I came by to give my regards
after hearing that she was unwell.

789
00:58:03,829 --> 00:58:05,164
That is quite strange.

790
00:58:05,956 --> 00:58:09,293
You have never masked your discontent
at the news of the Queen's ailments.

791
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:14,631
And yet, you came
all the way here to see her?

792
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:16,008
Also,

793
00:58:17,676 --> 00:58:19,845
what brings you here, Mong-woo?

794
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,182
Your Majesty, I--

795
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:25,392
Her Majesty must have summoned him.

796
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:28,937
Am I wrong, Your Majesty?

797
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:33,984
Did you summon the <i>gidaeryeong</i>, My Queen?

798
00:58:39,406 --> 00:58:42,159
Yes, I did.

799
00:58:42,826 --> 00:58:45,079
This is becoming even more strange.

800
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:48,415
You do not know how to play <i>baduk</i>

801
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,418
and are not even feeling well.

802
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:53,587
So why would you summon the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

803
00:58:55,214 --> 00:58:59,510
who should only answer to me
while I happened to be away?

804
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:03,889
I wanted to discuss the matter
of Grand Prince Munseong with him.

805
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:04,848
And what could have

806
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:08,185
prompted you to discuss a matter
regarding the Grand Prince

807
00:59:09,186 --> 00:59:11,563
with a complete stranger
like the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

808
00:59:12,856 --> 00:59:13,857
Well…

809
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:15,692
Because…

810
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:19,696
I was going to inform you in advance,

811
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,281
but I failed to do so.

812
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:25,327
I was not aware
that you were out of the palace.

813
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:26,829
My goodness.

814
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,916
Seeing as she cannot speak straight,
she must be very ill.

815
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:33,085
Let us leave so she can rest.

816
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:34,670
Mong-woo, you answer me.

817
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:38,298
Why did the Queen summon you?

818
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:45,472
I do not know why Her Majesty summoned me,

819
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:47,224
but I will inform you of our conversation.

820
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:49,685
Her Majesty questioned me

821
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:53,897
if I would be willing to teach
<i>baduk </i>to Grand Prince Munseong.

822
00:59:57,234 --> 00:59:58,735
And what did you say?

823
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:04,366
I replied that I could not do so
without your approval.

824
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:08,287
And how come you sought
a <i>baduk</i> tutor for the Grand Prince?

825
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:11,331
The truth is,

826
01:00:12,082 --> 01:00:16,336
Grand Prince Munseong asked me
to get him a <i>baduk </i>table a while ago.

827
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:18,046
I assume

828
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,341
that the news of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
sparked his curiosity.

829
01:00:24,678 --> 01:00:26,013
Mother,

830
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:28,348
did you happen to hear their conversation?

831
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:32,102
I did not.

832
01:00:32,686 --> 01:00:35,105
It must have taken place
before my arrival.

833
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:36,190
Is that so?

834
01:00:37,316 --> 01:00:39,026
Is anyone outside?

835
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,531
Did you summon me, Your Majesty?

836
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:46,825
Bring Grand Prince Munseong immediately.

837
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:48,994
As you wish, Your Majesty.

838
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:53,373
Your Majesty.

839
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:58,086
Surely an offhand request
for a <i>baduk </i>table from the Grand Prince

840
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,130
cannot be so important.

841
01:01:00,214 --> 01:01:02,007
Depending on his answer,

842
01:01:03,008 --> 01:01:05,052
this may become an important matter.

843
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,224
If he answers
that no such request was made,

844
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:14,394
it means the Queen and the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
have both lied to me.

845
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:15,312
And if so,

846
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:18,023
I must find out…

847
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,528
why they have done so.

848
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,296
Your Majesty,

849
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,632
Grand Prince Munseong is here.

850
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:03,610
Welcome, Grand Prince Munseong.

851
01:02:05,153 --> 01:02:06,196
Grand Prince.

852
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:09,408
Have you ever asked the Queen
to get a <i>baduk </i>table for you?

853
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:16,999
Yes, Your Majesty.

854
01:02:17,624 --> 01:02:21,712
I have indeed asked her to get one for me.

855
01:02:21,795 --> 01:02:25,090
How come you turned to the Queen
instead of me?

856
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:28,635
I wanted to inform you

857
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:30,887
after learning the basics of <i>baduk </i>first.

858
01:02:30,971 --> 01:02:34,308
I thought you might then find joy
in my interest in <i>baduk</i>--

859
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:39,313
It appears the Grand Prince
wanted to win your heart over with <i>baduk</i>.

860
01:02:39,896 --> 01:02:42,107
No, that is not--

861
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,692
How dare you talk back?

862
01:02:44,234 --> 01:02:45,777
Is that all you have learned from me?

863
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:49,781
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

864
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:54,453
Your senseless meddling

865
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:56,121
ended up leading to trouble!

866
01:02:57,581 --> 01:02:58,624
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

867
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:01,043
<i>If Her Royal Highness gets angry,</i>

868
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:04,338
<i>beg for her forgiveness
and ask to be punished.</i>

869
01:03:04,421 --> 01:03:08,508
<i>That way, His Majesty's wrath
will not fall upon you.</i>

870
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:11,345
Please forgive me.

871
01:03:11,928 --> 01:03:13,722
This happened due to my foolishness,

872
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:17,225
so please punish me
and do not condemn Grand Prince Munseong.

873
01:03:20,354 --> 01:03:21,813
Grand Prince Munseong.

874
01:03:22,397 --> 01:03:23,857
Yes, Your Majesty.

875
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:26,526
Do you really wish to learn <i>baduk</i>?

876
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,362
Do not mind him, Your Majesty.

877
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:30,280
He does not know what he is saying.

878
01:03:30,364 --> 01:03:32,199
He only feigned interest
as a means to an end.

879
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:34,868
- Is that not true, Grand Prince?
- Speak up.

880
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:38,705
Do you want to learn <i>baduk</i>?

881
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:41,875
If you would allow it,

882
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:44,002
I would like to learn.

883
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:48,507
All right then.

884
01:03:49,174 --> 01:03:51,218
I will get you a <i>baduk </i>table,

885
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,638
so learn from the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

886
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:58,642
I am very grateful, Your Majesty.

887
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,810
That will not do.

888
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:03,230
You will only spoil him
if you grant his request easily.

889
01:04:03,313 --> 01:04:06,191
With you in charge of his education,

890
01:04:06,274 --> 01:04:08,360
what could possibly go wrong?

891
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:12,948
Though that is quite true…

892
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:16,827
You must teach him with all your heart.

893
01:04:18,495 --> 01:04:19,788
Of course, Your Majesty.

894
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:22,457
I will try my best to become a good tutor.

895
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:50,902
Was involving Grand Prince Munseong
your idea or the Queen's?

896
01:04:55,615 --> 01:04:57,868
As Her Majesty was distressed,

897
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:59,870
I merely showed her a way out.

898
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:03,582
However, I did not fabricate
the Grand Prince's interest.

899
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:05,625
How come you helped the Queen?

900
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:09,171
Her Majesty and I
were about to fall into the snares

901
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:12,507
that the two most noble persons
had prepared for one another.

902
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:14,551
I could not sit back and watch.

903
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:18,764
I simply helped her as it was the only way
to ensure my own survival.

904
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:22,476
Are you certain that is all?

905
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:26,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

906
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:29,024
That is all there is to it.

907
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,867
The Queen Dowager, the woman
who gave birth to me and raised me,

908
01:05:39,493 --> 01:05:42,078
will not admit defeat so easily.

909
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:48,084
Nor will she excuse you
for helping out the Queen.

910
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:49,544
She will do whatever it takes…

911
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:52,923
to have you groveling on your four

912
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:56,927
while begging for her forgiveness
with tears flowing from your eyes.

913
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,722
How do you plan on avoiding her wrath?

914
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:07,145
I have no means to avoid that.

915
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:11,650
However, risking her wrath was inevitable

916
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,485
to uphold your command regarding patrons.

917
01:06:15,111 --> 01:06:17,155
All I can do now
is turn to you for your help.

918
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,291
Do you still expect help from me?

919
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:41,388
Do not worry.

920
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,516
You are the <i>gidaeryeong</i> and my person.

921
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:47,686
As you have adhered to my royal command,

922
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,566
I shall protect you too.

923
01:07:08,915 --> 01:07:10,041
Your Majesty.

924
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,836
Forgive me, but may I ask you a question?

925
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:18,174
It seems like you have much to ask for.

926
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,885
What is it?

927
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:23,138
How come you granted
Grand Prince Munseong's request?

928
01:07:28,226 --> 01:07:30,270
I learned <i>baduk </i>when I was his age.

929
01:07:31,021 --> 01:07:33,315
I granted his request
as it reminded me of my past.

930
01:07:38,528 --> 01:07:40,655
Do not dream of using
the Grand Prince's tutoring

931
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:43,366
as an excuse to neglect
your duties as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

932
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,618
Am I understood?

933
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:49,748
Of course, Your Majesty.

934
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:12,896
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
at your service, Your Highness.

935
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,399
This is the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
I told you about, Sister.

936
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,821
Greetings.

937
01:08:25,992 --> 01:08:27,577
Where is the <i>baduk </i>table?

938
01:08:28,244 --> 01:08:31,414
It is in the pavilion. Let us head there.

939
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:55,855
Myung-ha?

940
01:09:06,783 --> 01:09:09,035
Your Highnesses.

941
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:11,371
Have you been well?

942
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:15,041
I apologize for the belated greetings.

943
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:18,128
Please forgive me for failing my duties.

944
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:20,422
No.

945
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:22,882
Do not say such things.

946
01:09:29,389 --> 01:09:30,432
Your Highness,

947
01:09:31,016 --> 01:09:32,517
do you not remember him?

948
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:34,185
To speak the truth,

949
01:09:34,936 --> 01:09:36,229
I do not recognize him.

950
01:09:36,312 --> 01:09:38,606
It is natural you do not.

951
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:42,610
Did I not mention that Myung-ha
became the Sixth Royal Secretary?

952
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,487
You did.

953
01:09:46,406 --> 01:09:48,241
When will you teach me <i>baduk</i>?

954
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:50,118
We have no time.

955
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:53,079
Her Royal Highness
only granted an hour of learning.

956
01:09:53,705 --> 01:09:55,331
Let us begin now.

957
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,978
Let us stop here for today.

958
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:18,313
As you wish, Your Majesty.

959
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:25,403
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

960
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:26,654
Summon Kang Mong-woo.

961
01:10:27,614 --> 01:10:29,032
Your Majesty.

962
01:10:29,115 --> 01:10:32,535
The <i>gidaeryeong</i> is currently tutoring
the Grand Prince at the Royal Garden.

963
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:33,995
Yes, that is right.

964
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:35,747
It slipped my mind.

965
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:40,001
It did not slip your mind.

966
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:42,045
You are simply too engrossed
in a single matter.

967
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,798
On what, exactly?

968
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:46,841
The <i>gidaeryeong</i> you keep summoning,

969
01:10:48,593 --> 01:10:50,136
Kang Mong-woo.

970
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:57,685
Enough of that nonsense.

971
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,068
No one shall follow me.

972
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:14,452
So?

973
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:15,954
Have you reached a decision?

974
01:11:16,746 --> 01:11:17,872
My answer is no.

975
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:23,294
I cannot put Their Highnesses at risk
solely to achieve my goal.

976
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:24,879
I doubt that is your true reason.

977
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:28,424
You are afraid
that the incident three years ago

978
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:30,385
may repeat itself.

979
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:36,349
Losing your kin again for aiding me
would be a tragedy you want to avoid.

980
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:40,061
If that is how you feel,

981
01:11:40,145 --> 01:11:41,729
I will not insist.

982
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:52,866
You are right.

983
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:54,576
I am afraid.

984
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,287
I am afraid…

985
01:11:58,663 --> 01:11:59,747
I might hurt you again.

986
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,046
Will you join hands with me?

987
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,719
I will.

988
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:03,519
CAPTIVATING THE KING

989
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:06,564
<i>The story in itself is trivial,
but it is rather strange.</i>

990
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:10,818
The Sixth Royal Secretary and I
do not share a bond worth repairing.

991
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:14,614
Kim Myung-ha seemed
to want a strong bond with you.

992
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,617
<i>What a mysterious man.</i>

993
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,620
<i>He is hogging His Majesty's attention.</i>

994
01:13:20,703 --> 01:13:22,872
<i>Sever all your emotional ties
to Kang Hee-soo.</i>

995
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:25,250
<i>The King is already suspicious of us.</i>

996
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:26,918
<i>As he has returned to me alive,</i>

997
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:31,547
<i>I intend to protect him this time
no matter what happens.</i>

998
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:34,133
<i>How do you…</i>

999
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,844
<i>sever your feelings for another?</i>
