1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,870
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:07,169
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,478
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,839
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,383
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,637
There must be a criminal
for an interrogation to take place.

7
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:29,099
Who is this spy you speak of?

8
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,102
Has Chu Dal-ha

9
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:35,022
mentioned the spy by their name?

10
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:46,324
I shall reveal the criminal's name

11
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:48,618
in the interrogation.

12
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:53,665
Forgive me for saying this,

13
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,127
but a crude handling of the matter

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,089
may place you in a precarious position.

15
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,633
What dares to make you say so?

16
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,684
Should your interrogation
to find and punish the spy

17
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,895
who colluded with the Qing
become known to Prince Rui,

18
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:16,021
he will become furious.

19
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:20,025
It may end up disturbing
the peace between the two nations.

20
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,862
Your determination to punish the criminal

21
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:26,907
may become a detriment

22
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,368
that endangers your reign.

23
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,460
That would constitute
their interference in our affairs.

24
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:41,171
The Qing have their hands
on our every affair.

25
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,799
Even the crumbling fortresses
of the borders

26
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:46,968
are being neglected because of the Qing.

27
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:50,430
Are you confessing the failings
of the Border Defense Council?

28
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:53,725
Then it seems I must abolish the Council.

29
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,019
Is Eunuch Kim outside?

30
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,445
Have you summoned me, Your Majesty?

31
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:08,323
The Border Defense Council's involvement
with this interrogation will be barred,

32
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:09,825
so order all its members to leave.

33
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,578
See if Inspector General Kim Je-nam
has come to the palace

34
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,747
and have him see me
with the Chief Royal Secretary.

35
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:17,415
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:24,840
Principal Director.

37
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,053
You may leave now.

38
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,581
EPISODE 14

39
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,607
When selecting the officials
joining the interrogation,

40
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:26,234
exclude all the members
of the Border Defense Council.

41
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:31,489
Mobilize all the royal secretaries,
the clerks, and the runners

42
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:34,159
to review all records
of the spy case from three years ago

43
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:36,870
and reports from the borders,
then report back to me.

44
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,289
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha

45
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,250
shall be excluded
as he was involved in the case.

46
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,169
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,046
I shall follow your command.

48
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,593
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,637
I apologize for asking,

50
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,848
but why have you decided to look into

51
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:00,227
the report of Chu Dal-ha
when he has tried to assassinate you?

52
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:07,776
It is because his report
aligns with my wishes.

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,529
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,740
Are you suspecting the spy
who colluded with the Qing

55
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,702
to be among the members
of the Border Defense Council?

56
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:22,791
Do you suspect it to be

57
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,043
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan?

58
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,304
Is that why

59
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,181
you commanded me to find a way

60
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:42,227
to abolish the Border Defense Council
and reform the court?

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,522
I have wanted to do that since long ago.

62
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,483
But I have yet to discuss it
with the court.

63
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:53,780
Then I shall report to you again
after coming up with a detailed plan.

64
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,658
That is correct.

65
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:01,329
But I could not abolish it rashly

66
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,665
as the Council's influence
had grown so much.

67
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:05,583
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,837
I shall carry out your command
as your devoted subject,

69
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,257
but the court will resist ferociously.

70
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,014
I am prepared for it.

71
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,786
The capital traitor
who joined hands with the Qing

72
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,790
and put this nation
and its people in a crisis.

73
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,961
I will find that vile spy

74
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,881
and have them punished for high treason.

75
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:56,342
I will have their disgraceful name
engraved in the records

76
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:00,305
so that the people of this nation…

77
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,184
will remember their crime.

78
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,478
My brother

79
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,689
was poisoned to death.

80
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,778
Who would have dared to commit
such an atrocious and treasonous act?

81
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:17,155
Tell me, who did it?

82
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,373
His Majesty

83
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:29,834
summoned all members
of the Border Defense Council at night

84
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,962
and then commanded us
to leave all of a sudden.

85
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:35,048
He should not treat court officials

86
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:38,218
in such a coarse manner.

87
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,428
There has been an attempt on his life.

88
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,597
That would explain his mood.

89
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,434
In my opinion,
he has some other designs in mind.

90
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:49,020
Summoning Kim Je-nam out of the blue

91
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,814
was a sign in itself.

92
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,609
It seems that he does not trust us--

93
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:55,819
Right State Councilor.

94
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,029
You are crossing the line here.

95
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,158
Are you suggesting that His Majesty
does not trust the Principal Director?

96
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,120
- That is not it.
- Enough.

97
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,374
That is enough.

98
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,335
Why do you think

99
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:17,340
His Majesty has decided
to look into the report of a traitor?

100
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:21,052
It is because Chu Dal-ha

101
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,974
will most certainly name another traitor.

102
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,351
And that traitor's name

103
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:32,814
will clear His Majesty's name
of being Prince Rui's spy.

104
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,233
Whoever is named by that man,

105
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,735
that traitor and their family
shall be destroyed

106
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:41,281
and all those associated with them
will be arrested

107
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,492
and executed for high treason.

108
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,704
When the interrogation begins,

109
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,874
there will be a bloodbath.

110
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:56,045
There is only one way
to stop that from happening.

111
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,923
We must prevent this interrogation

112
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:04,012
before it causes such chaos.

113
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:13,771
Go to the library with the runners
and get the Royal Secretariat's Records

114
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:16,316
and all the reports from the borders
from three years ago.

115
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,442
Yes, my lord.

116
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,197
My lord.

117
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,073
What is my duty?

118
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:26,201
You are to stay away for the time being.

119
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,746
As you were involved
in the spy case three years ago,

120
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:32,790
His Majesty ordered your exclusion.

121
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:03,112
Your Majesty.

122
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:05,698
Are you sure you do not need
a royal physician to tend to you?

123
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:09,160
Though you may not be seemingly injured,

124
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,454
I suggest that you be examined
just in case.

125
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:14,207
Morning examinations are enough.

126
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,752
However, Your Majesty…

127
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:18,753
Your Majesty.

128
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:21,965
Captain Joo Sang-hwa has a report to make.

129
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,007
Let him in.

130
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,635
With all due respect,

131
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,929
it is past your bedtime.

132
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,764
You can meet him tomorrow.

133
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,432
It is fine. Let him in.

134
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:32,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

135
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:53,162
How is Mong-woo doing?

136
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:55,790
She seems to be in shock
from Chu Dal-ha's arrest.

137
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,585
And it seems a man named Se-dong

138
00:09:58,668 --> 00:10:00,670
has frequented
and shared the news with her.

139
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:03,923
Do not forbid him from visiting,

140
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:07,218
but report to me immediately
should anything happen to her.

141
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,178
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,404
Captain Joo.

143
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:29,991
Just how poor are you at your job?

144
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,912
I have never been on good terms with you,

145
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:37,415
but I have trusted you wholly
with His Majesty's safety.

146
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:38,333
However,

147
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,586
this incident was a bolt out of the blue.

148
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,922
An assassination attempt from a traitor?

149
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,384
You are right.

150
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:50,970
It is all my fault.

151
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,515
The biggest problem

152
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,895
is his visits to his private residence.

153
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,398
If you cannot stop his travels,

154
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:05,568
such an incident may end up recurring.

155
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:07,737
I concur.

156
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,031
However,

157
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,284
that is up to His Majesty to decide.

158
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:16,412
It is neither up to me nor you.

159
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,458
But Captain Joo…

160
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:31,761
I am back.

161
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:35,098
Did the Special Firearms Unit
not tell you off?

162
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:37,558
Master Choam
must have told them that I would visit,

163
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,685
as they did not stop me from entering.

164
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:41,562
What about the State Tribunal?

165
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:43,272
What will happen to Master Chu?

166
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:46,109
The King will interrogate him himself,

167
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:49,404
so he will be imprisoned
until he is transferred to the palace.

168
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:52,490
Then why did they arrest him like
they were going to kill him immediately?

169
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,659
That really scared me.

170
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:58,162
Please see to it
that he is well taken care of, Se-dong.

171
00:11:58,246 --> 00:11:59,414
Do not worry about that.

172
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,124
Jeomine and I will take care of it.

173
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:04,335
Thank you.

174
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,045
- You may leave.
- All right.

175
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,630
Get some rest.

176
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,176
You should lie down, my lady.

177
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,638
My lady?

178
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:18,141
How come His Majesty

179
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:21,853
returned to the palace
without saying a word to me?

180
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:24,480
In my opinion,

181
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:27,775
I think he left in a hurry

182
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:31,404
in case you were troubled
by Master Chu's affair.

183
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,948
Could that be the only reason?

184
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:55,678
Your Majesty.

185
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:57,221
You are in good health today

186
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,639
and show no symptoms.

187
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,183
About that poison.

188
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:05,104
The poison that killed my brother.

189
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,440
Have you yet to find it?

190
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:11,319
Forgive me.

191
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:14,447
It was not found
in the herbal medicine he used to take

192
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,324
or the bowl that contained it,

193
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,785
but on the royal robe
he coughed up his blood on.

194
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,621
I could only confirm that he took poison,

195
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:25,082
but could not learn
what kind of poison it was.

196
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:30,296
I understand the difficulty of the task.

197
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,424
But do not give up and keep working on it.

198
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,134
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:50,483
His Majesty ordered me
to greet you on his behalf.

200
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:55,947
My heart almost stopped at the news
of the assassination attempt.

201
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,950
Why could he not have come himself

202
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,577
for such an easy task
as coming to greet me?

203
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,247
I apologize.

204
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,957
The interrogation preparation is keeping--

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,917
How is His Majesty doing?

206
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:12,547
Like always,
he did not express any discomfort.

207
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:18,177
I hope his health has not been affected.

208
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,305
Did the royal physician examine him?

209
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,474
He took his pulse early in the morning.

210
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:27,436
His Majesty is healthy as ever.

211
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:35,611
Having you by His Majesty's side

212
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:38,239
does ease my mind.

213
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,493
You may leave.

214
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:00,136
What on earth is happening in the palace?

215
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,347
Has the Principal Director sent word yet?

216
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:05,850
I apologize.

217
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,561
I will send word again
to the court conference room.

218
00:15:08,644 --> 00:15:09,604
There is no need.

219
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,982
He will come without my calling
when it is time.

220
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,113
Your Majesty.

221
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:22,909
Chu Dal-ha attempted to assassinate you.

222
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,996
How could you hold an interrogation
over a report such a man made?

223
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:31,792
Please retract the order of interrogation.

224
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,378
The report from that traitor

225
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:38,466
must be a false one he concocted
to avoid punishment.

226
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,302
There is no solid evidence
proving the existence

227
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:43,054
of a spy who colluded with the Qing.

228
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:47,391
You must behead the criminal
and hang up his head for display

229
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,936
to show the gravity of his crimes
to the people

230
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,522
and let it serve as a lesson to all.

231
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,733
We implore you

232
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:59,320
not to dismiss our words of advice

233
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,657
and grant our petition.

234
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,077
- Please grant our petition.
- Please grant our petition.

235
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,714
I have seen you all

236
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:20,466
for a long time

237
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,135
since the days of the late king.

238
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,973
But every single one of you
remains the same

239
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,308
and eternally unchanging.

240
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:33,145
You act as if you care
for the nation and its people.

241
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:37,066
But do you truly think I do not realize
that your safety and personal gain

242
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:38,818
are your sole concern?

243
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:42,321
It is utterly appalling and disgraceful.

244
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,074
Compared to all of you,

245
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,576
Chu Dal-ha

246
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:51,330
is a thousandfold more loyal
as he risked his life

247
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:53,582
to report on the spy
who colluded with the Qing!

248
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,668
Your Majesty.

249
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,212
How could you
compare such a wicked traitor

250
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:01,007
to us court officials?

251
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,468
It is highly inappropriate!

252
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:05,845
Heed my words!

253
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:14,687
If anyone submits another petition
to go against me on this,

254
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,397
no matter who you are,

255
00:17:17,064 --> 00:17:20,609
I shall consider that you are
attempting to hide the spy

256
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,280
and have you punished for high treason.

257
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,380
That was strange.

258
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,008
I felt the same way.

259
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:45,634
His Majesty

260
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:48,888
seems to have been
bewitched by Chu Dal-ha.

261
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:51,640
That is not what I meant.

262
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,268
Then what is it?

263
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:56,145
I have never seen

264
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,647
the Principal Director stay so silent

265
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:00,983
when His Majesty was this enraged.

266
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:04,862
You are right.

267
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,865
Whenever His Majesty was furious,

268
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:11,368
he would be the first to show deference
and soothe the King's wrath

269
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,120
to mediate the situation.

270
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:14,955
But he did not step in once today.

271
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,207
Earlier at the hall of governance,

272
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,376
I overheard the Left State Councilor
talking to the Minister of Rites

273
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,505
that His Majesty decided
to look into Chu Dal-ha's report

274
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,093
to clear his name
of being Prince Rui's spy.

275
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:35,059
It is all bygones now,

276
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:37,603
but three years ago,

277
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,399
I shared Lord Kim Jong-bae's suspicion

278
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:46,779
that Grand Prince Jinhan had sent a spy
to both the Ming and the Qing.

279
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:48,739
But to hear

280
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:52,201
that Chu Dal-ha had acted upon
the late king's command

281
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:55,579
and that there was another spy
who communicated with the Qing in secret.

282
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:00,334
This is pure chaos I cannot fathom.

283
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:04,839
So, tell us.

284
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:07,007
For what reason was your father

285
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:10,803
so convinced that His Majesty
was the spy back then?

286
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,555
Pardon?

287
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,601
Right, the reason was…

288
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:23,440
Why has His Majesty
summoned the Border Defense Council?

289
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:25,568
There has been a report
of a breach of the peace treaty

290
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,361
whereby a spy named Chu Dal-ha

291
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,363
was dispatched to the Ming
to communicate with them.

292
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:33,576
Did you just say Chu Dal-ha?

293
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,536
Do you recognize the name?

294
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:36,704
Recently,

295
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:39,874
I have seen him at a courtesan's house
that Grand Prince Jinhan frequents.

296
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,335
Are you saying you saw
the Grand Prince meeting with him?

297
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:45,838
That is correct.

298
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,966
I saw them clearly with my two eyes.

299
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,225
What is wrong, Myung-ha?

300
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:18,120
What insolence is this?

301
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,420
You bastard.

302
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:28,380
Do you have a death wish?

303
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:30,466
Yes.

304
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,968
I may as well kill you
and take my own life today.

305
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:38,182
What wrong did I ever do to you
that you would treat me thusly?

306
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,017
You clearly told my father

307
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,270
that you witnessed a meeting between
Grand Prince Jinhan and Chu Dal-ha

308
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:45,064
at Hongjang's courtesan house.

309
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,610
Did I say those words?

310
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,278
My father believed in your lies

311
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:53,280
and…

312
00:20:54,198 --> 00:20:56,992
thought that Grand Prince Jinhan
was the spy who colluded with the Qing.

313
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:57,993
My father…

314
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,788
died because of you.

315
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:04,250
Let me go!

316
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:16,595
You should get your story straight
even in your raging state.

317
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:19,223
Lord Kim Jong-bae

318
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,517
died at His Majesty's hands.

319
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,311
So how is his death my fault?

320
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,564
All I ever did was tell him

321
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:31,151
what he had wanted to hear.

322
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,572
Even if it had not been for my lies,

323
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:38,033
he would have found a way

324
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:41,662
to accuse His Majesty as the spy.

325
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:45,791
Do you think His Majesty
would agree with you?

326
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,381
I will have you tied to the rack
along with Chu Dal-ha for interrogation.

327
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:53,799
Who knows?

328
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:59,471
He may even attest that you were the spy
who colluded with the Qing.

329
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,110
Please spare my life.

330
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:17,489
Please forgive me this once.

331
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:19,783
It is all in the past, is it not?

332
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,290
Does this mean you are forgiving me?

333
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,834
Just you wait.

334
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,004
I shall contemplate
how best to deal with you

335
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:34,381
to relieve my anger.

336
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:45,809
Principal Director.

337
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,562
What did you just say?

338
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,981
His Majesty is attempting
to sever his ties to me

339
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:54,610
despite my significant
contribution to his reign

340
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:58,822
and our bond bound by the heavens.

341
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:04,745
And why would he wish to do so
when you are his one and only uncle?

342
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,377
Do not tell me…

343
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,882
it is because of the suspicion
regarding the late king's poisoning.

344
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,427
It is for another reason.

345
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:24,056
But you assured me
there could be no other reason.

346
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,140
Back in the day,

347
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,227
I once told you that I had a plan

348
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:33,190
I had worked on for a long time
to secure His Majesty's ascension.

349
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:35,317
I was the one…

350
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:39,947
who secretly informed Prince Rui

351
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,283
that the late king sent a spy to the Ming.

352
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,704
Why did you do such a thing?

353
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:56,588
That is exactly it.

354
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:00,551
You must feign ignorance like so
to the King as well.

355
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,177
Tell him you did not know

356
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,429
and that the Principal Director
is not a spy.

357
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,060
I sincerely did not know.

358
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:11,145
Did you

359
00:24:11,854 --> 00:24:13,772
truly not notice any oddity?

360
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:15,983
Did you believe

361
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:21,530
the Qing troops' timely invasion of Uiju
when Grand Prince Jinhan was in trouble

362
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,324
and the late king's sudden passing

363
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:28,328
were all mere coincidences?

364
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,789
It is highly unseemly

365
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:33,834
to depreciate my services thusly.

366
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:47,890
Do not worry.

367
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:53,729
His Majesty cannot dare to cast me away.

368
00:24:55,856 --> 00:24:57,191
If he dares to bring me down,

369
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,944
he will crumble before I do.

370
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,810
I hear Chu Dal-ha's interrogation
is being prepared.

371
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,021
We are currently selecting the judges.

372
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:17,565
However,

373
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:21,444
the court is complaining
because the criminal has not been named.

374
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,989
There is no chance
that Chu Dal-ha knows their name.

375
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,743
This must be by His Majesty's design.

376
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,624
I am worried as he seems to be

377
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,918
rushing the case for some reason.

378
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,254
If the court's resistance grows stronger,

379
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:44,175
his safety will be put at risk.

380
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,562
Bollocks! You cannot!

381
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,864
I must go to the palace today.

382
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,825
I must see His Majesty.

383
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:11,119
I have to look into Master Chu's case

384
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,372
and inform the Sixth Royal Secretary
about the recent developments as well.

385
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:18,042
You cannot go to the palace in this state.

386
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,794
I will go instead.

387
00:26:20,336 --> 00:26:21,879
I shall go to the State Tribunal

388
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:23,339
- and the palace--
- Jageunnyeon.

389
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:29,679
Jageunnyeon.

390
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:33,391
Stop calling my name.

391
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:35,810
If you call me like that,

392
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:39,939
I cannot dissuade you from going.

393
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,611
Thank you.

394
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:32,366
Why did you come to the palace
when you have not fully recovered yet?

395
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,621
I came as I had something to tell you.

396
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:39,165
Is it because

397
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,752
I arrested Chu Dal-ha without telling you?

398
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,549
How would I dare
to comment on your decision?

399
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:50,092
Nevertheless,

400
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,096
if you arrested Chu Dal-ha to protect me

401
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,600
when you knew
it was all my crime and not his,

402
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,686
I must say you still do not know me well.

403
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,230
I decided to take measures first

404
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:05,650
as I anticipated you would react this way.

405
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,487
Was it because I am a woman?

406
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,198
It is because you are <i>my</i> woman.

407
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:21,624
This interrogation

408
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,709
is being held

409
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:27,213
to find the treacherous spy of the Qing
from three years ago.

410
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:32,385
This is a quest I have long striven for
and a duty I must fulfill.

411
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,764
What could I possibly do

412
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,142
if I had you bound in ropes as a traitor?

413
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:45,523
The fear that you might get hurt
would paralyze and bar me.

414
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:48,526
I understand how you feel.

415
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,071
I know guilt weighs on your heart.

416
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,323
However,

417
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,451
this is also what Chu Dal-ha wants.

418
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:00,121
Remember that and return home.

419
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,040
Your Majesty.

420
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,587
Is the spy who communicated with the Qing

421
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,757
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan?

422
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,929
I looked back
upon hearing the news of the abolition

423
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:18,014
of the Border Defense Council.

424
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,475
Having the Grand Prince
accompany you to the <i>gisinje</i>,

425
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,436
the substitution of the Princess,

426
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,189
and the appointment of the Crown Prince

427
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:32,320
were all a power struggle
between you and the Principal Director.

428
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:40,453
Three years ago,

429
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,874
when my father was taken to the Qing,

430
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,209
when Hongjang died,

431
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,505
and when I was at death's door,
I took a vow before the heavens

432
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:55,217
that I would dethrone the captivated king

433
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:56,802
and bring justice to the world.

434
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,847
And that I would make you feel the pain

435
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,726
and suffer the indignity of being betrayed
by the person you trusted.

436
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,563
But in hindsight,

437
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:10,858
the one who was captivated…

438
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,402
was me.

439
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,741
I was blinded by the captivation

440
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:22,370
and failed to see the man you truly are.

441
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:30,419
In truth,

442
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,839
I still do not understand, Your Majesty.

443
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:37,551
Attacking the Principal Director
will only endanger your reign.

444
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:41,889
For what reason
are you taking such a high risk?

445
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:48,396
I was ashamed.

446
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:56,153
Even a powerless commoner…

447
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:00,908
risks their lives

448
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,868
to carry out their duties.

449
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:04,578
But I, their king,

450
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,249
have failed to do anything.

451
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,671
Hiding the crimes I have committed…

452
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,802
has been eating me alive.

453
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,849
Are you referring to the crime

454
00:31:26,392 --> 00:31:28,060
that you mentioned to me?

455
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,439
The one that began three years ago

456
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:34,984
and still continues to this day?

457
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:38,904
You will turn your back on me
if you learn what it is.

458
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:42,867
You will spit on my face,

459
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,077
condemn,

460
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,039
and loathe me.

461
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:55,379
If it is against your wishes,

462
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:57,214
you do not have to say anything.

463
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,469
What more can I hide from you?

464
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,521
When the late king passed away,
he gave me his last words.

465
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,774
<i>Find…</i>

466
00:32:15,274 --> 00:32:18,319
the one who harmed me

467
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:21,864
and punish them.

468
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:23,908
And see to it

469
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,787
that the Prince Royal
ascends to the throne.

470
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:34,668
I went against my brother's last words
and ascended to the throne.

471
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:43,552
The man standing before you…

472
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,225
is a criminal who usurped the throne.

473
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,256
Your Majesty.

474
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:25,386
You ascended to the throne

475
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,138
to keep the late king's last words.

476
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:32,017
It was to protect
the Grand Prince and the Princess

477
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:35,813
that you became a criminal.

478
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:43,988
For the past three years,

479
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:50,452
I have been wandering,
lost in the Underworld.

480
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,082
However,

481
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,044
you are still in the Underworld.

482
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:12,766
I will stay by your side every step.

483
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:16,520
I will endure it all with you…

484
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:21,066
and be of support to you.

485
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,194
My lord.

486
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:08,030
His Royal Highness summons you.

487
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,844
Your Royal Highness.

488
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,598
Master Kang is here,
Sixth Royal Secretary.

489
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:48,362
The King has barred
my involvement in the interrogation.

490
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,908
I was worried when you
disappeared from Banchon Village,

491
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:54,785
but seeing as you are well,

492
00:35:56,704 --> 00:36:00,332
I strongly suspect that you and the King
may be on the same side.

493
00:36:04,044 --> 00:36:05,379
Even if Chu Dal-ha

494
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:07,756
names His Royal Highness or me
during his interrogation,

495
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,259
I will not be shocked.

496
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:15,514
I can assure you that will not happen.

497
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:17,891
Do not worry.

498
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,018
Then answer me.

499
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:23,564
How come you are all well
when Chu Dal-ha is at death's door?

500
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:25,274
Where have you been all this time?

501
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,073
Are you not the one
who proposed to plot treason together?

502
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,163
Perhaps the King

503
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,790
already has full knowledge of our plot.

504
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,921
Answer me.

505
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:59,099
What on earth has happened?

506
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:03,187
Chu Dal-ha…

507
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,649
attempted an assassination and failed.

508
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:11,361
It was because I was captivated

509
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:14,782
that I failed to see
the King's real intention.

510
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:17,159
But now,

511
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,953
I am certain of what it is.

512
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:22,790
The interrogation…

513
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,960
is His Majesty's measure
to protect His Royal Highness.

514
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:32,591
Can you swear to the heavens
that this is not a lie

515
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,593
to relieve me of my worries?

516
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,096
I swear on my life.

517
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,396
Had you not sworn,

518
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:49,191
I just might have believed you.

519
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,853
My lord.

520
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:27,896
Let us…

521
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:47,040
- He is over there.
- Right.

522
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,669
My goodness, how awful.

523
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:53,046
Thank you.

524
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,758
- You have half an hour.
- Yes, of course.

525
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:03,682
Master Chu.

526
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:06,560
We are here.

527
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:11,523
My lady.

528
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:15,319
How is your wound?

529
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,238
It is bearable.

530
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,158
How are you doing?

531
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,245
It is bearable for me as well.

532
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,583
Goodness, when did you prepare all this?

533
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,501
He will not be able to finish it all.

534
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,213
It is not even that much.

535
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:35,923
This is Bun-yeong's regular meal.

536
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,093
It was indeed very pleasing
to see her down a meal, was it not?

537
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,598
Please take good care of Bun-yeong.

538
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,769
I shall try.

539
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,815
Goodbye, my lady.

540
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:56,652
You.

541
00:39:57,736 --> 00:39:59,279
Have you seen me somewhere?

542
00:40:00,322 --> 00:40:01,240
I am not sure.

543
00:40:01,323 --> 00:40:03,533
It is my first time seeing you.

544
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:05,953
Is that so?

545
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,874
Wait, Se-dong, do you remember that man?

546
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,253
The Principal Director's servant
we met for Bun-yeong's matter.

547
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,046
Do you mean Mak-dong? What about him?

548
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:19,174
Do you remember how he recognized me
when I had never seen him?

549
00:40:20,133 --> 00:40:21,176
That is true.

550
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,346
He did ask you
if you had ever seen him somewhere.

551
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,307
What are you talking about?

552
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,185
Do give us an explanation
so we can understand.

553
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:33,355
Who is Mak-dong?

554
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:34,356
Three years ago,

555
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:38,235
there was a man
who told the Qing of all my movements.

556
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,821
Mak-dong,
the Principal Director's servant,

557
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:43,031
just may be that man.

558
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,916
So it is not that
Chu Dal-ha remembered Mak-dong,

559
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,003
but rather Mak-dong
who recognized him first?

560
00:40:56,878 --> 00:40:57,796
But that alone

561
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:01,591
does not prove that Mak-dong
tailed Chu Dal-ha.

562
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,468
Nevertheless,

563
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,305
his being a servant
of the Principal Director

564
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:08,640
cannot be a mere coincidence.

565
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:11,560
Please have him questioned just in case.

566
00:41:17,357 --> 00:41:19,860
Principal Director,
I apologize for coming at this hour.

567
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:22,154
It is fine.

568
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:24,197
What brings you here?

569
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:28,076
I am here to ask your servant,
Mak-dong, a few questions.

570
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,455
It is on His Majesty's order,
so please hand him over to us.

571
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:35,000
Summon Mak-dong.

572
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,961
My lord.

573
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:42,382
He left early today
to visit his relatives in his hometown.

574
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:45,177
He will be back in a few weeks.

575
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:48,513
Did you hear him?

576
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:52,225
I understand.

577
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,269
I shall return then.

578
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,921
I apologize, my lord.

579
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:24,216
I did recognize his face.

580
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,635
But I only saw him so long ago,

581
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:30,555
so I could not recollect who he was.

582
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,226
At least you remember now.

583
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:55,038
Mak-dong.

584
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,209
Thank you for your work.

585
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:02,838
I will not

586
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:06,216
forget your kindness, my lord.

587
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,018
Stop right there!

588
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:25,402
Arrest him!

589
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:26,528
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

590
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:29,633
Good work.

591
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:39,142
Take this letter to Uiju.

592
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:41,353
A month from now,

593
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:43,313
the Qing's envoy, Jung Je-pyo,

594
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:45,815
will arrive with a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

595
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:48,985
Tell him that I have sent you

596
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:51,446
and give him this letter.

597
00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,114
Yes, my lord.

598
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,081
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

599
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:02,165
Forgive me.

600
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:04,793
Mak-dong, Principal Director
Park Jong-hwan's servant,

601
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:07,462
was found dead with his throat slit.

602
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:10,507
If his throat was slit,
that means he was murdered.

603
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,592
This was clearly to silence him.

604
00:45:26,147 --> 00:45:27,148
Chief Royal Secretary.

605
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:28,483
Yes, Your Majesty.

606
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:32,237
Summon Principal Director
Park Jong-hwan this instant!

607
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,321
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:35,282
Your Majesty.

609
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:39,411
I am not sure he will admit
his crimes of murdering Mak-dong.

610
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:41,454
I am not summoning him to question that.

611
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,748
Then for what, may I ask?

612
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,251
I must…

613
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,048
give my uncle his final warning.

614
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:11,484
His Majesty requests you inside.

615
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:33,898
Principal Director.

616
00:46:34,983 --> 00:46:36,317
Confess your crimes and be punished.

617
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:38,111
I will not interrogate you if you do.

618
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:42,991
I am not sure which crime
you are referring to, Your Majesty.

619
00:46:43,074 --> 00:46:45,034
Do you truly believe

620
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,829
your treasonous collusion with the Qing
can remain a secret?

621
00:46:50,915 --> 00:46:52,834
When the interrogation begins,

622
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,087
all your crimes from murdering Mak-dong
to concealing your liaison with the Qing

623
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:59,549
to poisoning the late king to death
will be exposed.

624
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,761
Your Majesty.

625
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:05,805
With all due respect,

626
00:47:06,764 --> 00:47:10,226
you cannot punish me
for the late king's death.

627
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:15,565
Even if a poisoning took place
and I gave out the order to do so,

628
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:18,651
you cannot expose those crimes.

629
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,363
If you punish me for them,

630
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,493
the people will think
that they were your doing.

631
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,913
And this will serve
as a pretext for treason,

632
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:34,042
which will then lead to your dethronement.

633
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:38,838
A pretext for treason?

634
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,055
A pretext for treason, you say.

635
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:52,352
The people believe

636
00:47:54,354 --> 00:47:57,106
that I poisoned my brother
and my sister-in-law

637
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,441
to ascend to the throne

638
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:04,113
and committed depravity
by taking my brother's woman.

639
00:48:04,697 --> 00:48:05,532
The people

640
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:09,369
condemn and point fingers at me
for being a pathetic king.

641
00:48:10,703 --> 00:48:14,040
A king who lets
the Principal Director, his uncle,

642
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:17,877
take control of the court
and abuse his power as he sees fit

643
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:20,838
and also indulges himself in <i>baduk</i>

644
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,884
with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,
a man whom he is attracted to

645
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:27,637
at Yeongchwijeong.

646
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:33,059
All my actions so far…

647
00:48:38,064 --> 00:48:39,899
provided ample pretexts for treason.

648
00:48:49,784 --> 00:48:51,828
That is why I am taking action now.

649
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:56,958
The king…

650
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,503
executing his own kin

651
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:03,715
who has recklessly wielded his power

652
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:08,344
will inspire the people more than ever.

653
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:14,601
Do not be concerned about treason.

654
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:16,060
All this is to prevent one.

655
00:49:16,144 --> 00:49:17,395
I will give you one final chance.

656
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:22,358
Confess your crimes and be punished.

657
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:23,860
If you do,

658
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:26,154
I shall spare you from the humiliation

659
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,489
of being interrogated in the open.

660
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:29,532
What is your choice?

661
00:49:35,163 --> 00:49:37,165
Allow me some time to think.

662
00:49:37,248 --> 00:49:38,207
You have one day.

663
00:49:41,919 --> 00:49:43,963
You will come here
at this exact hour tomorrow

664
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:46,591
and confess your crimes.

665
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:35,098
The spy who colluded with the Qing
that His Majesty is looking for.

666
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:38,226
That spy is you, is it not?

667
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:42,563
My lord.

668
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:45,483
Meet Kim Myung-ha.

669
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:49,946
Why do you suggest
that I meet him out of the blue?

670
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:52,615
Three years ago,

671
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:55,118
Minister of War Kim Jong-bae

672
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:58,287
suspected Grand Prince Jinhan
of being a Qing's spy.

673
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,207
The dispatch of a spy to the Ming

674
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,960
and the secret communications to the Qing

675
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:06,212
were all considered to be

676
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:10,550
Grand Prince Jinhan's machinations
to dispose of the late king

677
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,343
and ascend to the throne himself.

678
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:15,680
Back then,

679
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:19,976
I was impressed that Grand Prince Jinhan
had accomplished such feats.

680
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:24,063
That is why I abandoned Kim Jong-bae

681
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,649
and joined hands with him.

682
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:28,776
How interesting.

683
00:51:30,528 --> 00:51:31,738
Continue.

684
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:37,326
After observing you closely
for a few days,

685
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,246
I realized that all those feats

686
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:44,751
were accomplished by you
and not His Majesty.

687
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:47,920
And it turned out the person
I wanted to serve

688
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,797
was not Grand Prince Jinhan.

689
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,968
It was you, my lord.

690
00:51:56,554 --> 00:51:57,472
Watching His Majesty

691
00:51:58,473 --> 00:52:02,143
state his will to punish the spy
who colluded with the Qing

692
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:07,231
filled me with fury.

693
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,650
If I were you,

694
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,112
I would have exploded in indignation.

695
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:17,325
After all your service to His Majesty

696
00:52:17,408 --> 00:52:20,286
whereby you even put up with
the sordid business of being a spy,

697
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:22,371
His Majesty

698
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:24,457
fails to see…

699
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,047
Anyway,

700
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:35,134
what I wanted to say is

701
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:43,351
that a king who does not appreciate
a loyal subject is not worth lingering on.

702
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:49,065
Do you think Kim Myung-ha
would meet with me?

703
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:54,278
I shall act as your intermediary, my lord.

704
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:15,299
I told you to wait, did I not?

705
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:18,845
I came to convey a message
from the Principal Director.

706
00:53:27,687 --> 00:53:30,773
So in other words,
the Principal Director is asking me

707
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:33,317
to join hands with him in treason.

708
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,611
What do you mean by treason?

709
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:39,907
We will ascend the Crown Prince
to the throne, his rightful place,

710
00:53:40,408 --> 00:53:44,829
and liberate your father's soul
from his bitter resentments.

711
00:53:48,082 --> 00:53:49,375
Park Jong-hwan

712
00:53:50,585 --> 00:53:51,711
must be the spy.

713
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,963
Am I wrong?

714
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:02,763
It seemed you had a falling out
with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

715
00:54:05,057 --> 00:54:06,142
Is that not right?

716
00:54:07,476 --> 00:54:09,520
When the interrogation begins,

717
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:13,816
my name may roll off
of Chu Dal-ha's tongue,

718
00:54:14,358 --> 00:54:16,110
but he could easily say yours.

719
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:19,196
He may end up naming both of us.

720
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,158
Therefore,

721
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:25,912
we must stand on the same side
as Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

722
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:27,038
That is the only way

723
00:54:27,538 --> 00:54:30,958
His Royal Highness, you, and I

724
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:33,586
can survive.

725
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,384
Why do you hesitate?

726
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:43,763
Do you not want revenge on the King
for your father's death?

727
00:54:51,103 --> 00:54:52,647
Do think about it

728
00:54:53,648 --> 00:54:55,733
and let me know by tomorrow morning.

729
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:21,634
Kim Myung-ha

730
00:55:21,717 --> 00:55:24,762
wishes to join hands with you.

731
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:28,140
Words alone are not enough.

732
00:55:29,517 --> 00:55:30,643
I need solid proof

733
00:55:31,477 --> 00:55:34,855
that he will support me in this cause.

734
00:55:35,523 --> 00:55:38,484
What kind of proof do you have in mind?

735
00:55:42,363 --> 00:55:44,657
Convey this message to him.

736
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,672
Welcome, Sixth Royal Secretary.

737
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:06,303
What is going on here?

738
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:09,765
Father did not forget my wish
and gave me his approval

739
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:13,060
to play <i>baduk </i>with my master.

740
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:20,484
It has been a while
since I have seen you smile.

741
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:25,656
Do you think this is inappropriate
during my mother's mourning?

742
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,866
No, Your Royal Highness.

743
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,035
I was only happy to see you smile.

744
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:37,710
Is something the matter?

745
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,339
No, do not mind me.

746
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:06,572
Your Royal Highness.

747
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:09,033
Principal Director.

748
00:57:11,744 --> 00:57:13,162
Sixth Royal Secretary.

749
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:16,707
Principal Director.

750
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:26,759
Your Royal Highness.

751
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:30,846
Please forgive me
for my negligence so far.

752
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,432
I shall visit you more often

753
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,685
and make sure to be of service to you.

754
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:40,898
Thank you.

755
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:56,330
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

756
00:57:56,414 --> 00:57:58,999
<i>Principal Director Park Jong-hwan is here.</i>

757
00:58:00,835 --> 00:58:03,504
State your crimes, Principal Director.

758
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:10,010
I apologize, Your Majesty.

759
00:58:12,263 --> 00:58:14,557
But I have none to state.

760
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,727
I have been your loyal subject thus far

761
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:20,688
and have never been disloyal to you.

762
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:24,733
I have always been prepared
to give you my life if necessary.

763
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,402
However,

764
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:28,821
not even a royal command

765
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:31,740
can force me to falsely confess
crimes I did not commit,

766
00:58:32,324 --> 00:58:34,326
for a smear against my reputation

767
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:39,039
equates to one against the reputation
of you and this nation.

768
00:58:39,123 --> 00:58:40,374
You adamantly…

769
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,003
refuse…

770
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:47,715
to state your crimes?

771
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,925
Yes, Your Majesty.

772
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:52,636
As I have no more to say,

773
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:55,764
I shall excuse myself now.

774
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,791
Chief Royal Secretary.

775
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:25,377
Yes, Your Majesty.
Please give me your command.

776
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,339
I will summon the criminal
and interrogate him tomorrow,

777
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:29,840
so make sure to prepare.

778
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,551
Yes, Your Majesty.

779
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:37,806
Your Majesty.

780
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,267
With all due respect,

781
00:59:40,351 --> 00:59:41,519
summoning the Principal Director

782
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:44,647
to the interrogation
without evidence or witness is risky.

783
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:47,900
The official's mistrust toward you
will only grow

784
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,903
and make it more difficult
to abolish the Border Defense Council.

785
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,781
In truth,

786
00:59:57,368 --> 01:00:00,412
there is a witness and evidence

787
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,748
that I have been saving as a last resort.

788
01:00:07,962 --> 01:00:10,047
Where might they be?

789
01:00:26,772 --> 01:00:27,648
My lady.

790
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:29,692
Senior Court Lady Han is calling for you.

791
01:00:35,197 --> 01:00:37,366
Lead the way.

792
01:01:03,976 --> 01:01:05,060
Principal Director.

793
01:01:27,499 --> 01:01:28,751
Why are you standing about?

794
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:29,960
Take it already.

795
01:01:31,962 --> 01:01:33,714
Are you telling me to take my own life

796
01:01:35,132 --> 01:01:36,592
now that you have no use for me?

797
01:01:38,177 --> 01:01:39,386
How foolish.

798
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,308
Taking your life is a child's play.

799
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:47,394
I would not need <i>this </i>to do so.

800
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,690
Then what…

801
01:02:07,164 --> 01:02:10,209
What would you do if I refused?

802
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:17,299
I shall report thusly
when His Majesty holds an interrogation.

803
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:19,385
"Senior Court Lady Dong

804
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:22,388
poisoned the late king to death for you,
Your Majesty."

805
01:02:24,056 --> 01:02:28,977
His Majesty will not forgive you
for poisoning the late king to death.

806
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:32,314
If he forgave you,

807
01:02:33,023 --> 01:02:36,735
he would become a depraved tyrant
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.

808
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:39,697
He will have you killed

809
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,491
to clear his name.

810
01:02:45,953 --> 01:02:47,579
Do not be so foolish.

811
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,749
This is all for your sake.

812
01:02:54,878 --> 01:02:55,796
Saving yourself

813
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,757
should always come first.

814
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:14,314
That is more like it.

815
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,857
Senior Court Lady Dong?

816
01:04:02,988 --> 01:04:05,407
Are you all right?

817
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:15,834
Please wait.

818
01:04:20,464 --> 01:04:21,340
Take it.

819
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:53,038
Stop acting generous
with that despicable face of yours.

820
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:56,625
You are nothing but a fraud

821
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:59,545
deceiving everyone
with your false appearance.

822
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:08,345
How you must want to boast
that you are His Majesty's only woman.

823
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:10,597
You have no chance.

824
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,644
You are neither a man nor a woman.

825
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,939
His Majesty's affection will not last.

826
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,279
I have no intention

827
01:05:26,947 --> 01:05:29,491
to compete against you
for His Majesty's affection.

828
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:36,832
Of course not.

829
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:40,085
I do not care.

830
01:05:40,919 --> 01:05:42,212
I am sick of everything.

831
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:43,589
I cannot…

832
01:05:45,465 --> 01:05:47,092
carry on any longer.

833
01:05:53,307 --> 01:05:54,308
Now,

834
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:57,978
I will carry out what tasks I can.

835
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,535
<i>Your Majesty,
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.</i>

836
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,516
You are the evidence
of my brother's murder

837
01:08:01,268 --> 01:08:02,894
and the witness who bears knowledge

838
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,814
of Park Jong-hwan being the spy
who colluded with the Qing.

839
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,359
<i>Chief State Councilor.</i>

840
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:11,403
His Majesty urgently calls for you.

841
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,156
Did he also call for a Royal Secretary
and an official historian?

842
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:16,450
He only asked for you, my lord.

843
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:22,372
Are you suggesting
we send a spy to the Ming?

844
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,750
That is correct.

845
01:08:28,295 --> 01:08:29,838
Last night,

846
01:08:29,921 --> 01:08:32,674
His Majesty gave a secret order
to the Chief State Councilor.

847
01:08:34,384 --> 01:08:35,427
Good work.

848
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:46,813
Senior Court Lady Dong.

849
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:53,653
Attend the interrogation
and confess your crimes tomorrow.

850
01:08:54,946 --> 01:08:57,157
If you confess your crimes
and those of the Principal Director,

851
01:08:57,657 --> 01:09:01,036
I will make a judgment
in light of your efforts.

852
01:09:01,703 --> 01:09:02,871
You will be punished,

853
01:09:03,997 --> 01:09:05,207
but not executed.

854
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,590
<i>His Majesty will not forgive you
for poisoning the late king to death.</i>

855
01:09:13,673 --> 01:09:15,884
<i>If he forgave you,</i>

856
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:19,387
<i>he would become a depraved tyrant
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.</i>

857
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:23,934
<i>He will have you killed to clear his name.</i>

858
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:31,817
Your Majesty.

859
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:35,195
I shall follow your command.

860
01:09:38,323 --> 01:09:39,282
In return,

861
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:46,665
please grant my request.

862
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:54,923
This is the final request…

863
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,594
that I will be making.

864
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:11,982
What is it?

865
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,411
CAPTIVATING THE KING

866
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:50,997
<i>Even if I have to quash
all resistance from the court,</i>

867
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:52,999
<i>the interrogation will be held.</i>

868
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:55,252
Bring an end to this case.

869
01:11:55,335 --> 01:11:56,378
Enough!

870
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,338
Do you not see that you will be endangered

871
01:11:58,421 --> 01:12:00,840
<i>if you punish the Principal Director?</i>

872
01:12:00,924 --> 01:12:03,760
Answer my question!

873
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:07,847
<i>You have held on so far
for this day to come, Your Majesty.</i>

874
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,433
<i>Treason? That is ridiculous.</i>

875
01:12:10,517 --> 01:12:12,560
<i>Who informed you of such a lie?</i>

876
01:12:13,144 --> 01:12:16,314
<i>The Emperor wishes
to play</i> baduk<i> with the </i>gidaeryeong.

877
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:20,819
<i>The Qing's envoy
must have caused you distress.</i>

878
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:24,197
<i>I do not understand these feelings.</i>

879
01:12:24,864 --> 01:12:25,949
<i>I am afraid.</i>
