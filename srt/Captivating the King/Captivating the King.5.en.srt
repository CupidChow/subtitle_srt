CAPTIVATING THE KING

00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,258
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,567
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:09,988
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

EPISODE 5

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,292
<i>My lady.</i>

7
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:33,795
<i>It has been a long time
since I have sent word to you.</i>

8
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:38,091
<i>The Special Firearms Unit
has been more alert to uncover</i>

9
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:40,218
<i>any suspicious behavior
since early last month,</i>

10
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,803
<i>so I had to be cautious.</i>

11
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:45,056
<i>The vigilance has increased
in and out of the palace</i>

12
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,393
<i>as the First Senior Consort</i>

13
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:51,062
<i>was caught sneaking a shaman
into the palace to perform rituals</i>

14
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:53,773
- <i>in hopes of bearing the King's son.</i>
- How dare you!

15
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:54,899
- Hurry!
- What are you doing?

16
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,360
- <i>She was expelled and exiled that day.</i>
- Let me go!

17
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:58,778
<i>However, before she was exiled,</i>

18
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:02,031
<i>she implored His Majesty that
Her Royal Highness approved the ritual,</i>

19
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,534
<i>so the palace was turned upside down.</i>

20
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,119
Please forgive me!

21
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:08,538
Her Royal Highness gave me her permission!

22
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,169
Your Majesty!

23
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,463
It is a greater sin
to be unfilial than disloyal.

24
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,465
Your people are watching.

25
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,383
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:23,553
<i>Her Majesty and the Great Lord
tried to soothe his anger</i>

27
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:25,180
<i>but to no avail.</i>

28
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,807
<i>His Majesty refused
to see Her Royal Highness</i>

29
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:30,852
<i>and stormed out for a walk,
raising an uproar.</i>

30
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:33,646
Go find His Majesty immediately!

31
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,192
<i>According to the maids
of the King's quarters,</i>

32
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:40,612
<i>Senior Court Lady Dong
is to blame for all of it.</i>

33
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:44,157
<i>His Majesty does not care
for Her Majesty and the concubines.</i>

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,576
<i>Scandalously, he only favors
Senior Court Lady Dong,</i>

35
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,369
<i>the late king's court lady.</i>

36
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:51,331
<i>Thus, Her Royal Highness,
who is hoping for a Prince Royal,</i>

37
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,958
<i>had to take drastic measures
and urged the First Senior Consort.</i>

38
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,881
<i>When His Majesty is out for a walk
or is not tending to state affairs,</i>

39
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:01,466
<i>he always goes to Yeongchwijeong</i>

40
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,509
<i>to play</i> baduk <i>with Prince Deokseong.</i>

41
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:07,138
<i>I would like to tell you more
about Yeongchwijeong,</i>

42
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:10,141
<i>but all servants of the court
are forbidden from entering.</i>

43
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,684
<i>Thus, not much has been known.</i>

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,437
<i>I will send you word again.</i>

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,401
<i>My lady.</i>

46
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:22,820
<i>I, Chu Dal-ha, send my greetings.</i>

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,034
<i>Prince Deokseong's residence
hosts feasts almost daily,</i>

48
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,286
<i>so I had no trouble getting in.</i>

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,371
My lord.

50
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:35,458
<i>Recently, he hired </i>baduk <i>players
to play and come up with clever moves.</i>

51
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,420
<i>It seems like it is to prepare tricks
to use against the King.</i>

52
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,631
<i>He is greedy yet resourceful.</i>

53
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:45,426
<i>Even the Three Hwans
seem wary of the flaunt of his power.</i>

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,181
<i>Right.</i>

55
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,850
<i>That refers to the Principal Director
of the Privy Council, Park Jong-hwan,</i>

56
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:54,727
<i>Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan,</i>

57
00:02:55,228 --> 00:02:57,981
<i>and the newly appointed
Minister of War, Min Ji-hwan.</i>

58
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:01,401
<i>People coined the nickname by playing on
the last syllable of their names.</i>

59
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:33,975
<i>Prince Deokseong,</i>

60
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,727
<i>I enclose the play explanation</i>

61
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:38,396
<i>of the </i>baduk<i> player I have recommended.</i>

62
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,857
<i>I hope you find it helpful.</i>

63
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:00,543
<i>I send my greetings to you, Master Choam.</i>

64
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:04,422
<i>I have read the play explanation
you have sent me.</i>

65
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:09,344
<i>The skills of the </i>baduk <i>player</i>
<i>you have recommended are exquisite.</i>

66
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,721
<i>I must say I am quite satisfied.</i>

67
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,183
"I would like to play <i>baduk</i>
with the player myself.

68
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:19,062
Please have them visit me
without any delay."

69
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,357
Congratulations.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,068
You became Prince Deokseong's
<i>baduk </i>player as you wished.

71
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,032
I imagined you were looking forward to it.

72
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,159
Why do you look so dispirited?

73
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,746
Are you afraid
now that things have worked out?

74
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,041
I am not afraid,

75
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,878
for I have looked forward to this moment
for three years.

76
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,130
However,

77
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:50,176
I am concerned
that I may be putting you in harm's way

78
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,887
if I go through with this.

79
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,722
Absolute nonsense.

80
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:57,392
If you were that concerned,

81
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,728
you would have accepted my plea
to go easy on me during our game.

82
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:08,820
I shall fend for myself.

83
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:09,904
Thus,

84
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:12,698
just worry about yourself.

85
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:17,620
You have generously taken me in
and cared for a fool like me.

86
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:19,872
I will never forget your kindness.

87
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:29,507
<i>My lady, the Sixth Royal Secretary
has been dismissed once again.</i>

88
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,926
<i>This is the third time already this year.</i>

89
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:34,512
<i>Why is it so difficult to revive</i>

90
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:38,474
<i>the peach tree the late king had planted?</i>

91
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,977
Your Majesty,
I have committed an unforgivable sin!

92
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,187
I beg for your forgiveness!

93
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:44,897
I do not want to see you.

94
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,066
Leave my sight now!

95
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,611
<i>With His Majesty's wrath
becoming greater by the day,</i>

96
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:54,323
<i>we are all praying
for a flower to bloom on the dead tree.</i>

97
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:57,451
<i>But I wonder if that day will ever come.</i>

98
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:25,331
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,544
You do not look well.

100
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,634
The new emperor of the Qing
has been chosen.

101
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:39,679
Prince Rui must have compromised,

102
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:43,140
seeing how he handed over
the throne to his young nephew.

103
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,895
Upon hearing the news
of the Emperor's sudden demise,

104
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,607
I thought there would be
a bloodbath over the throne.

105
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,570
It seems like he made a wise choice.

106
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:59,156
No matter how strong
Prince Rui's authority is,

107
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,076
one cannot go against nature's orders.

108
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,625
Your Majesty.

109
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,461
That is not what I meant.

110
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,505
You are right, Prince Deokseong.

111
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:19,510
It is only natural for the son
to inherit the throne than a brother.

112
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:21,345
It is the right way.

113
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:24,557
It seems I have been completely oblivious

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,058
to such a natural and just way.

115
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:29,979
Your Majesty.

116
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:32,523
I have committed an unforgivable sin.

117
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:35,818
I must have become senile with old age.

118
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,863
I beg for your forgiveness.

119
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:45,286
What is there to forgive
when you have only spoken the truth?

120
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:46,495
Is that not right?

121
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,134
My lady.

122
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:03,721
Why are you here?

123
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:07,600
Were you worried I would have forgotten
my way around the capital?

124
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:09,810
I have an urgent matter to discuss.

125
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,064
What is it?

126
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,167
Prince Deokseong died suddenly last night.

127
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:44,178
<i>Rumor in the capital has it
that he was murdered.</i>

128
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,978
Three years of effort
have been destroyed at once.

129
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:56,190
There is still a way.

130
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:57,650
You cannot do that.

131
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,568
Why are you always saying no?

132
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,737
The idea you keep pushing forth,

133
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:05,574
that you will end it all
by killing the King in your own demise,

134
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:07,451
is an act out of spite and not revenge.

135
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,413
My father and Hongjang
would not have agreed to it either.

136
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,458
Why are you acting like this
when you agreed to follow my plan?

137
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,337
Things may not go as you have planned.

138
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,880
Look what happened to Prince Deokseong.

139
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:21,882
It <i>will</i> go as planned.

140
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,551
I will not allow failure,

141
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,177
but if I do end up failing,

142
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:28,472
then you may have your way.

143
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:32,059
That is a promise.

144
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,811
Why are you being so relentless?

145
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,772
What a way to treat me.

146
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,238
Fine. I promise.

147
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,410
What will you do now?

148
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,288
I am hungry.

149
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,623
Let us eat first.

150
00:10:58,794 --> 00:10:59,795
Shall we?

151
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:24,403
Your Majesty.

152
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:25,946
The Principal Director
of the Privy Council,

153
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,240
the Great Lord,
and the Minister of War seek audience.

154
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,411
Let them in.

155
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:50,221
I believe I mentioned
that I would skip the morning assembly.

156
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,305
We are aware.

157
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:54,266
However, as members
of the Border Defense Council,

158
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,312
we have come to make an urgent request
despite the discourtesy.

159
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:06,403
What is this urgent request you speak of?

160
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,615
I shall inform you, Your--

161
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,200
You answer, Minister Min.

162
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,788
Your Majesty.

163
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:18,791
We seek to dismiss and punish the
Executive Assistant of Uiju, Kim Myung-ha.

164
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,043
Please grant us your approval.

165
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:23,921
What is the reason?

166
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,507
When those the Qing wanted
for trespassing on the border ran away,

167
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,217
Kim Myung-ha idly sat by.

168
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:31,095
He did not agree
to their extradition request either.

169
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,806
As he forsook his duties
to watch over the border,

170
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,517
it is only right
to dismiss and punish him.

171
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,230
I seem to remember
hearing a similar petition.

172
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:44,733
I knew you would remember, Your Majesty.

173
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,820
A report was once made
about his failure to capture

174
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:51,615
those who had trespassed the border
under the pretext of harvesting ginseng.

175
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:56,036
Thanks to your explanation,
I now clearly remember it.

176
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,207
Why did you not punish him back then?

177
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,295
This would not have happened
if you had fulfilled your duties.

178
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:07,715
Pardon?

179
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,425
Well, Your Majesty,

180
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,760
that was because…

181
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:14,430
It was clear he had received a bribe
and let them go,

182
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,849
but as we did not have
solid evidence or witnesses,

183
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,475
we could not punish him then.

184
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:23,647
Are you certain
the same thing will not happen?

185
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:26,358
Can you see it through this time?

186
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,322
Your Majesty.

187
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:34,366
If we do not punish
Kim Myung-ha for his crimes this time,

188
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,785
the Qing will not stand and watch.

189
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,163
We must dismiss and punish him

190
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:41,832
before the Qing's envoy arrives

191
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:44,209
to prevent their condemnation.

192
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,005
All right.

193
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:50,132
Summon him to the capital.

194
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,527
<i>Father!</i>

195
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,821
Father!

196
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:15,866
Father!

197
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:19,995
Father!

198
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,125
My lord.

199
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:32,549
Did you look into
the crumbling fortress wall?

200
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,886
I have safeguarded it temporarily,

201
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:39,139
but it will collapse after one heavy rain.

202
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:43,769
Jang Mu-dong's family
still lives underneath there, do they not?

203
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,480
Tell them to find another place.

204
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,732
They never listen to me.

205
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,069
It would be perfect
if we could just fix up the wall.

206
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:57,825
But why is His Majesty summoning you?

207
00:14:57,908 --> 00:15:00,577
Could it be because
we let those escapees go?

208
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,372
I shall know when I get there.

209
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,499
My lord, I have an idea.

210
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:07,376
Run away tonight.

211
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,378
I shall be your guide.

212
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,840
You should save yourself first.

213
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,261
Stop talking nonsense.

214
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:26,854
Surely His Majesty will dismiss
Kim Myung-ha this time, will he not?

215
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,814
Who knows?

216
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,733
He never grants the court's petitions.

217
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:37,114
It has been a while.

218
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:44,121
It appears that many people
have long waited for my death.

219
00:15:45,164 --> 00:15:47,541
They all look as if
they have encountered a ghost.

220
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,793
I do not know about others,

221
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,712
but my brother was quite anxious.

222
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:54,214
Your accomplishments,
regardless of their size,

223
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,924
have been eating him out.

224
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,553
His sighs probably made a big dent
in the floor of my family's parlor.

225
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,474
You have not changed.

226
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:06,101
I am glad that you smile.

227
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,896
Do not be afraid.

228
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:09,855
Who knows?

229
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:14,526
Today may not be your funeral,
but your luckiest day yet.

230
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:22,993
Your Majesty.

231
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:26,622
Please share your decision
on Executive Assistant Kim Myung-ha.

232
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,588
As of today,

233
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:37,925
you are dismissed from
the executive assistant position at Uiju.

234
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:43,680
You shall serve
as the Sixth Royal Secretary instead.

235
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:52,189
His luckiest day yet.

236
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,482
Your Majesty.

237
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,151
What do you mean by appointing him
to the Sixth Royal Secretary?

238
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,779
You must interrogate
and punish him for his crimes!

239
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:01,240
I am not done speaking.

240
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:03,951
Pardon?

241
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:07,746
Yes, Your Majesty. I apologize.

242
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,291
Heed me well, Kim Myung-ha.

243
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:13,085
Yes, Your Majesty.

244
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,461
Please give me your command.

245
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,381
There is only one duty
for the Sixth Royal Secretary.

246
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,300
Revive the peach tree in the Royal Garden.

247
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,177
If you fail to do so,

248
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,763
you will be dismissed

249
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:28,142
and you shall be punished severely.

250
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:34,398
I shall carry out your command
with all my heart.

251
00:17:44,158 --> 00:17:46,451
I am getting quite lonely

252
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:50,247
spending time alone at Yeongchwijeong.

253
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,959
I would like to appoint a <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

254
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,419
What do you think?

255
00:17:57,796 --> 00:17:59,006
Your Majesty.

256
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,092
Forgive me, but <i>gidaeryeong</i>
is a position I have not heard of.

257
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:05,262
One serving that role
will come to Yeongchwijeong upon my order

258
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,680
and play <i>baduk </i>with me.

259
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:09,391
It is a post that only caters to me.

260
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,983
Regardless of class or age,

261
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,902
if they are a capable <i>baduk </i>player,

262
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:23,363
I shall even allow a <i>palcheon</i>
to take the examination.

263
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:25,157
PALCHEON: THE EIGHT LOWEST CLASSES
THAT CARRIED OUT MENIAL TASKS

264
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:28,827
However,

265
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,829
public officials do not qualify,

266
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:34,583
even those who serve
at the lowest of the lowest rank.

267
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:38,378
Do not waste more time

268
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,131
and post the announcement.

269
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,072
Your Majesty.

270
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:09,034
You should have informed me beforehand.

271
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:12,246
Then I would have found fine <i>baduk</i> players

272
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,705
to send to Yeongchwijeong.

273
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,667
I brought it up during the assembly
to prevent just that from happening.

274
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,918
It was a warning…

275
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:24,174
not to send anyone in your pocket
to Yeongchwijeong again.

276
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:26,593
Your Majesty.

277
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:28,762
I am afraid I do not understand--

278
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,389
I am talking about Prince Deokseong.

279
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,022
I am aware that he was your man, Uncle.

280
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:45,862
Since when were you aware of it?

281
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:49,950
Prince Deokseong never tried to
hide the fact from the start.

282
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:53,287
Therefore, I did not cast him away.

283
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:57,249
But he died out of the blue.

284
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,754
Mobilizing the Special Firearms Unit
to seek his killer would have been easy,

285
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:03,672
but I held back.

286
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:06,091
I could make a fair guess
on who it would be.

287
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,760
However,

288
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,889
I will not hold back
should it happen again.

289
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,853
It would be wise to remember that.

290
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:25,360
What is your reason for appointing
Kim Myung-ha as the Sixth Royal Secretary?

291
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,572
What is the problem?

292
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,783
I dismissed him as per your request,

293
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,536
and the Sixth Royal Secretary was vacant.

294
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,705
Everyone avoided the position
as if it were a pest,

295
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:38,665
so I appointed him to that role.

296
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,711
The Qing will not stand back
to his promotion.

297
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:49,259
It is within my purview as the king
to judge his merits or demerits.

298
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,055
And it is the court's duty
to coax the Qing to accept my ways.

299
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:55,015
Am I wrong, Uncle?

300
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,189
Your words are correct
a thousand times over, Your Majesty.

301
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,440
You may leave then.

302
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:18,205
Lord Park.

303
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,582
What did His Majesty say?

304
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,128
He did not say much.

305
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:41,186
There you are.

306
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:45,190
Principal Director.

307
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,489
Your father's memorial day
is approaching, is it not?

308
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,408
It is early next month,

309
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:57,410
five days after
the late king's memorial service.

310
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,871
High treason such as his

311
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,707
would call for the remains
to be desecrated.

312
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,835
Despite being the traitor's son,

313
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:08,130
you were given a position
and an opportunity to repent.

314
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:12,175
His Majesty's kindness
is truly overwhelming.

315
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:17,931
You had better not

316
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:21,101
repay his kindness with evil.

317
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,230
Yes, my lord.

318
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:29,526
Congratulations on your promotion
to the Sixth Royal Secretary.

319
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,294
<i>How could he bring
a traitor's son into the court?</i>

320
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:49,421
Why did you not dissuade him?

321
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:52,382
Prince Rui has conceded the throne
to his young nephew

322
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:54,551
and has accepted to be a regent.

323
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:58,180
That must have caused
His Majesty a great amount of distress.

324
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:01,683
Are you saying he grew anxious that
Grand Prince Munseong would plot treason

325
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:03,143
with Kim Myung-ha at his side

326
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:07,647
and that he summoned him
to keep an eye on him?

327
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:14,196
What good is the Special Firearms Unit?

328
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,199
He could have just ordered them
to find his crime and punish him!

329
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,701
And what is this <i>gidaeryeong </i>nonsense?

330
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:22,787
Why would he establish a position
that is not even necessary for the state?

331
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,789
What will the people think?

332
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,251
I have no idea what he is thinking.

333
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,378
The <i>gidaeryeong</i> may be useful

334
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:32,214
in looking into the King's intention.

335
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:35,926
We need someone
to replace Prince Deokseong, after all.

336
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,470
The King is a very skilled <i>baduk </i>player.

337
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,974
In order to satisfy him,
they must be a very proficient player.

338
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,060
I know of a <i>baduk</i> master.

339
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,438
The <i>gidaeryeong </i>is as good as chosen,

340
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,023
so do not worry.

341
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,153
You make everything sound so easy.

342
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:58,782
Nothing is as easy as Guan Yu
beheading the leader of his enemies.

343
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:01,910
It will take
quite a bit of wealth and effort.

344
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:04,746
And what about Kim Myung-ha?

345
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:07,499
We cannot sit back and watch.

346
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,710
I have an idea.

347
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:21,817
Lord Park,
the Chief Royal Secretary is here.

348
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,465
Did you ask for me, Lord Park?

349
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:31,510
I asked to see you
as you would be distressed.

350
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:34,805
The sixth royal secretary
may be among the lowest ranks,

351
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:37,182
but the position requires one
to relay the royal commands.

352
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:39,810
It is not something
Kim Myung-ha should handle.

353
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,355
I hope you are not planning to let him be.

354
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:48,110
I cannot disobey royal command.

355
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:54,241
Then how about we delay giving him
his official appointment letter?

356
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,245
Yes, my lord. I shall do that.

357
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:13,927
How incompetent.

358
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,513
It is about time we <i>chejik </i>him.

359
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:17,514
CHEJIK: TO REPLACE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL

360
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:21,101
Must I tell you what to do as well?

361
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,189
I will ensure that Kim Myung-ha
does not receive the appointment letter.

362
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:27,358
Do not worry.

363
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:55,260
Gidaeryeong?

364
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:57,888
After Prince Deokseong's death,

365
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:00,391
I imagined there would be
no more shortcuts.

366
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:01,392
This is good.

367
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,768
I am against this idea.

368
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:05,938
What kind of a fool voluntarily
walks into the tiger's den?

369
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,482
Like you said,
I am going in to catch the tiger.

370
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:11,902
Why are you silent?
You should be convincing her not to!

371
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:14,822
Are you ready to risk your life?

372
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:20,119
I have been ready ever since I etched
my vow to my heart three years ago.

373
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:23,664
All right, then.

374
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,958
I support your decision.

375
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:29,253
Bollocks. This is crazy.

376
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:32,381
It looks like no one is willing
to listen to what I say.

377
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:33,924
Do whatever you want.

378
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,179
Goodness.

379
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,226
Let me know if there is anything you need.

380
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:47,104
I imagine you would need a <i>baduk </i>table.

381
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,273
It is not necessary,

382
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:51,567
but sure, get me one.

383
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,610
Yes, my lady.

384
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:34,526
Why must we endure this torture
on this hot summer day?

385
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,320
This heat is no big deal.

386
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:38,739
If you play your stones well,

387
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,825
you might enter Yeongchwijeong
and have wealth and fame for generations.

388
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:46,663
If there was no condition
that public officials could not apply,

389
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,874
you both would be there as well.

390
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,044
- Do you not think so?
- That is not true.

391
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:55,047
I am not interested
in such a meaningless position.

392
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:56,715
Is that so?

393
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:07,559
I guess I got the wrong idea

394
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,145
from your younger brother
playing over there.

395
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:14,525
I wrongfully thought that your family
had higher hopes for him than you.

396
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:16,193
Goodness.

397
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:18,946
Lord Min.

398
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:21,365
You are crossing the line.

399
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:27,788
Third Minister,
you are here as the overseer.

400
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:29,289
Please refrain from jesting.

401
00:28:30,332 --> 00:28:31,583
Overseer, my foot.

402
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:34,920
The winner is already as good as decided.

403
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:36,004
Sorry?

404
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:38,465
What did you say?

405
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:39,925
What?

406
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:43,220
I said it was about time
the games were over.

407
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:02,364
Look at that.

408
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:05,909
He must have been lingering distastefully
even after he had already lost.

409
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:24,761
That face.

410
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,597
Wait.

411
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:28,891
I know that face.

412
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,643
Who was it?

413
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,654
Kang Mong-woo.

414
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,489
Congratulations.

415
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:48,702
You!

416
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,412
Stop right there!

417
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:51,496
Hold him there!

418
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,956
Do not let him leave!

419
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:00,923
You cannot run away this time.

420
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:02,758
You crook.

421
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,095
My lord, a crook?

422
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:09,014
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

423
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:10,057
A misunderstanding?

424
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:13,143
I beat you three years ago
in a <i>baduk </i>gamble.

425
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:21,485
Do you not remember running away
without giving your table and stones?

426
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:26,198
Gosh, look here.

427
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,324
Look carefully.

428
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:34,706
This good-looking face
and graceful figure.

429
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,542
It is hard not to remember.

430
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:41,630
Did you just laugh?

431
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,174
Why?

432
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,468
What part of it was so funny?

433
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,387
My apologies.

434
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,016
I cannot take my eyes off of <i>baduk </i>stones
when I sit down for a game,

435
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,185
so I have trouble
remembering my opponents.

436
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,311
Also,

437
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:59,147
I rarely lose.

438
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:01,358
Then it is harder not to remember me.

439
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:03,151
Think back carefully.

440
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,990
Right. It rained that day.

441
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:09,408
When you noticed the drizzle,

442
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,910
you threw your stone and bolted out.

443
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,500
Rain.

444
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,335
- It is raining!
- What?

445
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:22,504
- It really is.
- Indeed.

446
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,131
<i>Mongwoo</i>.

447
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:25,966
It is your turn.

448
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,887
I lose.

449
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:37,477
It is impressive

450
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,604
that you remember something
from three years ago.

451
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,899
The victim never forgets.

452
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:45,360
The late king suddenly passed away then

453
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:47,279
and the spy incident blew up,

454
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:51,908
so most of the skilled <i>baduk </i>players
were arrested and interrogated.

455
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:54,870
Thus, I had given up on finding you.

456
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,622
Now,

457
00:31:57,706 --> 00:32:00,625
hand over the <i>baduk </i>table and stones
you owe me from three years ago.

458
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:02,419
Give them to me now.

459
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:04,338
I apologize,

460
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:06,840
but I cannot give them to you now.

461
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:07,883
What?

462
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,094
Do not tell me
you are trying to brazen it out.

463
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:12,637
I am not.

464
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:14,306
However,

465
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:18,602
I need my <i>baduk </i>table and stones
until the <i>gidaeryeong </i>examination is over.

466
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,897
I must train in order to see fruition.

467
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,359
I will pay you back
once I become the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

468
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:28,987
You seem to be quite confident.

469
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,990
Well, I may have a chance

470
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,992
since you have not applied.

471
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:39,164
I guess you are right.

472
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:42,417
I will see you tomorrow, my lord.

473
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:56,640
Listen.

474
00:32:56,723 --> 00:32:58,725
Do you know the patron of Kang Mong-woo?

475
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,353
I apologize,

476
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:04,356
but I only learned of his name just today.

477
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:14,991
How disappointing.

478
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:18,245
Should I have followed him?

479
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:40,559
Kim Hong-du makes his living
by playing <i>baduk</i> on the streets.

480
00:33:40,642 --> 00:33:43,854
Rumor says he was a sage
who used to train in Mount Geumgang.

481
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:46,440
Na Gang-taek is the great-grandson
of Lord Na Jin-yu,

482
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:48,358
the former director
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

483
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,279
"Kang Mong-woo"?

484
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:54,698
Who is this man?

485
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:57,993
Right, well…

486
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:00,912
I apologize, but I do not know.

487
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,915
I asked the clerks, but no one knew.

488
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,627
Is he not your man, Minister Min?

489
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,463
He is not.

490
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:11,131
Why would you think that?

491
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:14,134
I hear the people group you
with Lord Park and me

492
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,261
and refer to us as the Three Hwans.

493
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,680
It is preposterous,

494
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:21,057
but you may nurture such ambitions

495
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:24,561
by becoming the patron of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
who has access to Yeongchwijeong.

496
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:29,316
Is that why you became the patron
of the street <i>baduk </i>player,

497
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,693
knowingly risking Her Majesty's honor?

498
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,070
Who says that?

499
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,572
Who says I am Kim Hong-du's patron?

500
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,493
I do not think I mentioned the name.

501
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,956
Do not tell me you tailed me.

502
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,585
I hear that the man has been blabbing on
about how he has prayed

503
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,880
for Her Majesty's recovery
at Mount Geumgang.

504
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,757
Such insolence!

505
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,093
Her Majesty is healthier
than any ladies of the royal palace!

506
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,178
Is that so?

507
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,306
That is a relief then.

508
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:02,682
Why you little!

509
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:07,395
So…

510
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,774
you do not know
who is behind Kang Mong-woo?

511
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,611
No, I do not.

512
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:16,863
He applied to be a <i>gidaeryeong</i>
without a patron?

513
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,282
He must either be utterly naive

514
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:22,160
or very skilled in <i>baduk</i>.

515
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:23,578
That is good.

516
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:29,626
This man proves that the
<i>gidaeryeong </i>examination is fair and just.

517
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,047
Report this to His Majesty.

518
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:36,591
Yes, Lord Park.

519
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,772
Do you want to know who Kang Mong-woo is?

520
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:53,024
What is this?

521
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:56,528
Did you lie despite knowing his identity?

522
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,699
You have gotten very bold
since I last saw you.

523
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,742
He is that man from back then.

524
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,452
The <i>baduk </i>gambler from three years ago.

525
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,957
- What?
- The <i>baduk </i>gambler.

526
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,085
He is the very man who won
all the <i>baduk</i> tables in the capital

527
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,170
three years ago.

528
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,999
I shall bet on Na Gang-taek!

529
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:52,667
- Bring it in.
- All right.

530
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:56,504
- Any more bets on Na Gang-taek?
- Na Gang-taek!

531
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,972
Now, does anyone want to
bet on Park Se-gye?

532
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,142
Great Lord.

533
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:13,605
It was you.

534
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,774
I was afraid the Special Firearms Unit
had caught me.

535
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:18,234
Why would you worry about that?

536
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,195
Do not be concerned.

537
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:23,114
I have paved the path already.

538
00:37:23,198 --> 00:37:25,659
Are you saying there is someone in the
Special Firearms Unit who takes bribes?

539
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:28,536
He will lose his life
if Joo Sang-hwa finds out!

540
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,414
Have you ever seen anyone
bite the hand that feeds them?

541
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:33,625
No one says no to some extra money.

542
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:39,005
How is the life of a county magistrate
treating you?

543
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:43,093
It is all very bothersome.

544
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,012
I eagerly wait for the day
you will call me back to the court

545
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,515
as I endure my tenure there.

546
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,475
Do not worry.

547
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:53,144
I have spoken
to the Principal Director already.

548
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:55,146
I will put my trust in you, my lord.

549
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:57,899
All right!

550
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:00,819
Does anyone want to bet more money?

551
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:04,447
Here!

552
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,408
- Gosh.
- Kim Hong-du!

553
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,786
I will bet on Kim Hong-du!

554
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:17,794
Who is he?

555
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,462
He is the servant of the Great Lord!

556
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,965
- Me too!
- I want to bet on him!

557
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:24,467
- I will make the same bet!
- Quiet, everyone!

558
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:26,845
The bet on Kim Hong-du has been closed.

559
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,723
- Just take mine!
- That is cheap!

560
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:30,974
All right!

561
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:32,976
Who else will you bet on?

562
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:36,146
Kang Mong-woo!

563
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:44,112
I will bet on Kang Mong-woo.

564
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,573
"Kang Mong-woo"?

565
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,284
Did he just say Kang Mong-woo?

566
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,661
Does the name sound familiar?

567
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:54,956
Min Ji-hwan says otherwise,
but I think Kang Mong-woo is his man.

568
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:57,751
Is that all?

569
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,044
What do you mean?

570
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:02,380
Do you know how much this is?
This is all I have!

571
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,926
That is a lot.

572
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,470
Great.

573
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,514
Come forward
if you wish to bet on Kang Mong-woo!

574
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:14,142
Kang Mong-woo? Who is that?

575
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:16,311
It sounds like a lost dog's name.

576
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:23,443
I hope you will not regret it
after you get bitten by that dog.

577
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:26,196
Who is Kang Mong-woo?

578
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,239
Kang Mong-woo?

579
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,873
How is that funny to you?

580
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:38,666
That means you are the underdog, my lady.

581
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:41,169
I told you so, did I not?

582
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:44,088
I said no one would bet on Kang Mong-woo

583
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,799
and that was exactly what I wanted.

584
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:50,678
Those ignorant fools
were only betting on the Three Hwans' men.

585
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:54,516
I was furious inside
and almost caused a scene there.

586
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,892
Good job holding it in.

587
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:56,893
Thank you for your work.

588
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:58,895
I will get going then.

589
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:07,737
Kim Myung-ha has returned to the court?

590
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:09,447
Yes.

591
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:12,033
The King went against
the court officials' will

592
00:40:12,116 --> 00:40:14,619
and appointed him
as the Sixth Royal Secretary.

593
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,121
Why would he do that?

594
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:20,124
I assume it is to keep a close eye on him.

595
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,545
Seeing that the King gave him
a position no one coveted,

596
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:26,381
it must be to punish him
should an opportunity arise.

597
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:28,508
Do you think that is all?

598
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:31,052
Is something bothering you?

599
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:33,972
Why now?

600
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:36,933
He stayed put for the last three years

601
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:38,935
indulging in drinks,
women, and games only.

602
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,479
So why is he suddenly making moves?

603
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,482
That is what the King always does.

604
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:47,694
You are right.

605
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:51,239
With the Three Hwans leading the court,

606
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:55,159
he could be sending the court a message
not to look down on him as the king.

607
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:57,829
Right.

608
00:40:58,705 --> 00:40:59,747
That must be it.

609
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:15,555
How the time flies.

610
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,309
It seems like yesterday
that Master Chu barely managed to return

611
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:23,146
and we found Lady Hee-soo
and went into hiding in the mountains.

612
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:25,023
Search thoroughly!

613
00:41:25,106 --> 00:41:26,190
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

614
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:01,309
Are you crying?

615
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,686
As if.

616
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,521
The smoke got in my eyes. That is all.

617
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:07,941
Do not be concerned.

618
00:42:08,024 --> 00:42:09,734
Lady Hee-soo is exceptional.

619
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:13,321
She will beat all those nobodies
and become the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

620
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:15,782
I am not worried that she will lose.

621
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:18,368
I am worried because she will win.

622
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:19,827
You are right.

623
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:24,540
The palace and whatnot will only be filled
with obstacles for her.

624
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,590
Do you remember the prince
who used to play <i>baduk </i>with the King?

625
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:35,760
They say he suddenly met his end
while being carried on the palanquin

626
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:39,055
because he got
on the bad side of the King.

627
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:40,556
No way.

628
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,393
They say Monk Yusim,
who suddenly passed away last year,

629
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,479
was also poisoned to death
by the King's assassin.

630
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,233
He poisoned his own older brother

631
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:52,485
and his sister-in-law.

632
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,653
Gosh.

633
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:56,739
I mean, not even venomous snakes
bite their own kin.

634
00:42:58,616 --> 00:43:01,285
You must tell Lady Hee-soo

635
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:04,372
never to eat anything
when she is in the palace.

636
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,499
I do not want to hear it.

637
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:08,793
Stop saying such sinister things!

638
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:12,922
Why are you yelling all of a sudden?

639
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:14,590
I am just worried.

640
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:25,101
- What is with her?
- It is not like I made things up.

641
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:32,233
Consider Master Choam's efforts
and drink up every single drop.

642
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:33,860
You and your nagging.

643
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:35,862
Are you still worried?

644
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,489
Worried, my foot.

645
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,241
Why would I be worried?

646
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:43,202
With your skills, becoming the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
is a piece of cake.

647
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:47,749
And after that, the heavens will help you
punish those who deserve it.

648
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,293
I do not need the heavens' help.

649
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:51,919
I will do it.

650
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,673
I will punish them myself.

651
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:59,052
Of course.

652
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:00,803
Those bastards.

653
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:03,097
They should croak
before they can even utter an oath.

654
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:15,693
This is the list of people
who won today's game.

655
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:17,361
Read them to me.

656
00:44:18,446 --> 00:44:19,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

657
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,497
"Kim Mal-son, Kim Hong-du,

658
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:29,624
Na Gang-taek,

659
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,542
Park Se-gye,

660
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,294
Hong Yun,

661
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,171
Kang Mong-woo,

662
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:37,423
An Du-eon…"

663
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:39,634
Wait.

664
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,180
What did you just say?

665
00:44:46,557 --> 00:44:48,226
Are you referring to An Du-eon?

666
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:55,775
KANG MONG-WOO

667
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:01,239
Is something wrong, Your Majesty?

668
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:04,408
It is nothing.

669
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,703
I would like to be alone now.

670
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:11,874
Yes, Your Majesty.

671
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,292
Have a pleasant night.

672
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:38,776
<i>It is Mongwoo.</i>

673
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:42,321
This will be the prize of our bet.

674
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:48,286
It cannot be.

675
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:54,125
It must be someone with the same name.

676
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:17,023
I had my doubts,

677
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:19,150
but you survived.

678
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:24,530
I stand before you as I survived.

679
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,454
Why have you returned?

680
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,501
You and your discourtesy have not changed.

681
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:38,961
Answer me.

682
00:46:42,506 --> 00:46:43,507
So you have come.

683
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,346
I was worried you might not show up

684
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:50,222
after all my threats yesterday.

685
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,643
How can I not come when I will win?

686
00:46:55,102 --> 00:46:56,812
Your confidence would top them all.

687
00:46:58,022 --> 00:46:59,482
Let us go before you are late.

688
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:41,774
An Gyeong-yeop!

689
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:47,655
Kang Mong-woo!

690
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:56,372
What is the issue?

691
00:47:56,872 --> 00:47:58,958
As it happens,
there are no more plates left.

692
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:00,584
No more left?

693
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:03,045
What shall we do, Lord Min?

694
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:05,381
In such a case,

695
00:48:06,257 --> 00:48:07,967
it would be right to give him a free win.

696
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,510
That cannot be.

697
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:12,680
Here comes His Majesty!

698
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:56,098
Stop.

699
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:06,942
Raise your head.

700
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,918
What is your name?

701
00:49:29,548 --> 00:49:31,258
It is Kang Mong-woo, Your Majesty.

702
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,859
He should be in the middle of a game.

703
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:50,277
Why is he not playing?

704
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:54,365
We did not have enough players
to match with him,

705
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:56,075
so we were discussing what to do.

706
00:49:56,575 --> 00:49:59,286
In such cases,
it is common practice to give him a win.

707
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,205
But some voiced that it would be unfair.

708
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,625
- What should we do?
- The Sixth Royal Secretary shall play.

709
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:09,004
Your Majesty.

710
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:10,756
Forgive me, but I am present

711
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,800
as well as my brother, the overseer.

712
00:50:12,883 --> 00:50:14,969
Why might you be ordering
Kim Myung-ha to play?

713
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:18,722
I have stated that public officials
cannot apply to become a <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

714
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:20,599
Thus, you are all disqualified.

715
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:22,643
I named Kim Myung-ha specifically

716
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:25,354
as he is eligible, not having received
his appointment letter yet.

717
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:28,691
Would you be willing
to resign from your post for this?

718
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:30,943
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

719
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:33,737
I had not thought it through.

720
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:35,739
Begin the game.

721
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,869
You will lose to me at this rate.

722
00:52:07,864 --> 00:52:09,198
I lose.

723
00:52:11,284 --> 00:52:12,911
Would you like to count the stones?

724
00:52:14,996 --> 00:52:15,955
I shall do that.

725
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:30,178
Protecting this spot led
to the Sixth Royal Secretary's defeat.

726
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:33,681
He saved a stone
when he should have discarded it.

727
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:38,353
I thought I could expand my territory
after saving the stone.

728
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:41,356
<i>Saengbulyeosa.</i>

729
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,524
Even if you do save it,

730
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:47,362
a life without any merit
is a pointless one.

731
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:50,615
It is better to discard a stone
that has been cornered

732
00:52:50,698 --> 00:52:52,659
rather than to strive to save it.

733
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:56,371
I respectfully disagree, Your Majesty.

734
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:58,998
How insolent!

735
00:52:59,499 --> 00:53:02,335
How dare you share your opinion
when he did not even ask for it?

736
00:53:02,919 --> 00:53:04,253
I apologize, Your Majesty.

737
00:53:04,337 --> 00:53:06,339
He is ignorant of the court etiquette.

738
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:07,298
What are you doing?

739
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:09,133
- Beg for his forgiveness.
- Leave him be.

740
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:11,094
You may continue.

741
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:18,893
Had the Sixth Royal Secretary
not given up and reinforced this region,

742
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,854
I would have lost the game.

743
00:53:26,317 --> 00:53:28,444
If one examines closely,

744
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:31,280
one will always find a way
to save a cornered stone.

745
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:36,202
A likely story.

746
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:39,831
Kim Myung-ha is not good enough
to be the victor of this game.

747
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:41,249
Why would he trouble himself

748
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:44,252
when he will lose anyway?

749
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,547
Why do you look up at the sky

750
00:53:48,297 --> 00:53:51,050
when you will die anyway, Your Majesty?

751
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:54,053
You impertinent fool!

752
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:57,015
How dare you speak out of turn
before His Majesty?

753
00:53:57,598 --> 00:54:00,852
You cannot let his arrogance slide,
Your Majesty.

754
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:04,272
Why are you standing about, Captain Joo?
Drag him out immediately!

755
00:54:09,277 --> 00:54:12,488
As many have witnessed your impertinence,

756
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:15,658
I must give the order to drag you out

757
00:54:15,742 --> 00:54:19,245
and pull your pompous tongue out
to preserve my dignity as the king.

758
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:22,415
Do you have any last words?

759
00:54:25,126 --> 00:54:27,045
<i>Baduk </i>is shared between two players.

760
00:54:27,587 --> 00:54:31,841
While the two engage in a game,
they only converse through their stones.

761
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,427
They share a conversation

762
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,014
that transcends age, status,
and even loyalty.

763
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,017
If you still think
I deserve to be executed,

764
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,977
the <i>gidaeryeong </i>you should appoint

765
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:47,315
will have to be someone
perceptive and eager to please.

766
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:53,404
That way, you can avoid the hassle
of pulling out a tongue every time.

767
00:54:54,072 --> 00:54:55,573
You brat!

768
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:57,867
- That is enough, Minister Min.
- Your Majesty…

769
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,829
I apologize.

770
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,046
How audacious of you.

771
00:55:10,797 --> 00:55:13,800
You have one damnable tongue.

772
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:21,390
It is to my liking.

773
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:35,029
I will tell you a way
to save yourself from punishment.

774
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:44,956
Become the <i>gidaeryeong</i> at all costs.

775
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,917
Should you disappoint me,

776
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:53,381
I will pull your tongue out myself.

777
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,179
Yes, Your Majesty.

778
00:56:23,953 --> 00:56:25,955
Let us head to
the Queen Dowager's quarters.

779
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:27,081
Yes, Your Majesty.

780
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:31,294
His Majesty wishes to visit
the Queen Dowager's quarters!

781
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:36,299
Here comes His Majesty.

782
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:50,563
Welcome, Your Majesty.

783
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:53,524
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

784
00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:02,783
Your Majesty.

785
00:57:03,284 --> 00:57:05,244
Did something good happen?

786
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:07,788
It is quite rare
to see you in high spirits like this.

787
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:13,169
I cannot hide anything from you, Mother.

788
00:57:13,836 --> 00:57:17,465
I visited Chundangdae
to watch the <i>gidaeryeong </i>examination.

789
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:20,384
You must have found someone
to your liking.

790
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:21,427
Indeed.

791
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:24,222
There is someone I quite like.

792
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:26,557
Is that true?

793
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:28,976
I am very curious.

794
00:57:30,353 --> 00:57:32,355
So, what is his name?

795
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:33,940
Mong-woo.

796
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:36,317
His name is Kang Mong-woo.

797
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,451
Your Royal Highness, you do not seem well.

798
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:48,120
- Do you feel ill?
- No.

799
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:50,706
Do not worry about me

800
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,959
and look after yourself, Your Majesty.

801
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:56,963
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

802
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:01,467
Mother.

803
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:06,264
Even my eyes are telling me
that you do not look well.

804
00:58:06,347 --> 00:58:08,182
Are you sure you are all right?

805
00:58:10,643 --> 00:58:12,270
Of course, I am.

806
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:17,191
I hope the man you are fond of
makes it to the end

807
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:19,527
and becomes the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

808
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,404
Do not be concerned.

809
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,906
He will become the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

810
00:58:24,824 --> 00:58:26,617
without a hint of doubt.

811
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:34,101
Who became the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

812
00:59:36,187 --> 00:59:39,357
It looks like a three-year-old debt
returned to me as pure gold.

813
01:00:30,491 --> 01:00:32,493
Who gave you the permission
to start playing?

814
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:39,291
My apologies.

815
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,086
I was not aware of your presence,
Your Majesty.

816
01:00:50,594 --> 01:00:51,762
That seat

817
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,682
was occupied by

818
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:57,810
Prince Deokseong for the past three years.

819
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,813
Prince Deokseong…

820
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:06,610
was my first <i>baduk</i> master.

821
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,578
You must be deeply distressed

822
01:01:16,245 --> 01:01:17,997
to have lost your <i>baduk </i>friend
so suddenly.

823
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:33,137
I remember receiving a report
of your death three years ago.

824
01:01:37,183 --> 01:01:38,642
I was at death's door.

825
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,312
But I survived through sheer luck.

826
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:47,276
Then your best move
would have been to run away.

827
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,569
What is the reason

828
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:50,696
for your return?

829
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:56,494
The entire land of Joseon is yours.

830
01:01:56,577 --> 01:01:58,078
Where could I run to?

831
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:01,081
I thought it would be better

832
01:02:01,165 --> 01:02:03,834
to come before you
and seek a way to survive.

833
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:14,887
Why are you hiding your real name
and using the name Mong-woo?

834
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:20,434
I am not hiding my name.

835
01:02:21,268 --> 01:02:22,603
You would have forgotten,

836
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:25,189
but I only play <i>baduk</i> when there is a bet.

837
01:02:25,272 --> 01:02:26,982
- And--
- You only tell your real name

838
01:02:27,066 --> 01:02:28,651
to an opponent who beats you.

839
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:34,782
It is an honor.

840
01:02:35,407 --> 01:02:37,451
I did not expect you to remember--

841
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:40,496
I remember everything about you.

842
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,668
So stop hiding behind
all those nonsensical formalities

843
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,671
and answer my question immediately.

844
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,130
Why have you returned?

845
01:02:55,803 --> 01:02:57,388
Shall I answer for you?

846
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:03,769
You have returned

847
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:06,230
to get revenge.

848
01:03:07,857 --> 01:03:10,526
You harbor treasonous ambition
of murdering me, no?

849
01:03:18,617 --> 01:03:20,327
<i>Saengbulyeosa.</i>

850
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:26,083
You have survived,
yet you are no better than the dead.

851
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,960
What will you do now?

852
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:34,300
Answer me
with that wicked tongue of yours.

853
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:35,509
What will you do?

854
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:18,302
CAPTIVATING THE KING

855
01:04:18,385 --> 01:04:20,471
<i>I will be your patron.</i>

856
01:04:20,554 --> 01:04:21,889
<i>No man can resist</i>

857
01:04:21,972 --> 01:04:25,392
power, wealth, and beautiful women.

858
01:04:25,476 --> 01:04:26,810
<i>I would like to</i>

859
01:04:26,894 --> 01:04:30,314
become a dependable patron for you.

860
01:04:30,814 --> 01:04:31,982
<i>Do not worry.</i>

861
01:04:32,066 --> 01:04:33,943
You are the <i>gidaeryeong</i> and my person.

862
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:36,028
<i>I shall protect you too.</i>

863
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:38,155
<i>Why would I risk my life</i>

864
01:04:38,238 --> 01:04:40,074
<i>for something that will clearly fail?</i>

865
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:43,452
<i>If you want to live,
examine closely before answering.</i>

866
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:45,913
That way, you will see a way
to save yourself.

867
01:04:46,497 --> 01:04:49,541
<i>The opportunity to get revenge
on the enemy who slayed your father.</i>

868
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,335
Will you join hands with me?

869
