EPISODE 7

12
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,709
What are you two doing?

13
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:18,380
Your Majesty.

14
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:24,177
I asked what you two were doing.

15
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:27,722
I apologize, Your Majesty.

16
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:29,683
I was so filled with joy

17
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:32,519
that I treated the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
with great discourtesy.

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,898
What is this joyous occasion you speak of?

19
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,861
While delivering the <i>baduk </i>table,

20
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,407
I ran into Grand Prince Munseong
and Princess Jangryeong

21
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,452
and gave them my belated greetings
without your approval.

22
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:53,999
Not informing you
is a great crime in itself,

23
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,126
but I was so elated by the meeting

24
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:59,254
that I committed a great discourtesy
to the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

25
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,172
Furthermore,

26
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,841
I displayed such misconduct
before your very eyes.

27
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,259
I am to blame for all this.

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,179
I will suffer whatever punishment,
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,646
The story in itself is trivial,

30
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,276
but it is rather strange.

31
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:26,907
How can one confess to their crime
with such confidence and boldness?

32
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,670
As you have reported
the matter regarding the Grand Prince,

33
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:43,256
I will not punish you on that end.

34
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:47,302
I am truly grateful, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:50,597
The punishment for your misconduct
to Mong-woo is not mine to decide.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,556
It is up to him.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,849
What will you do?

38
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,356
As the Sixth Royal Secretary
has acknowledged his misbehavior,

39
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,399
if you do not find it punishable,

40
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:03,777
I will turn a blind eye as well.

41
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,656
How understanding of you.

42
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:08,573
In the end,

43
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,326
you are asking <i>me </i>to turn a blind eye.

44
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:13,995
Is that not right?

45
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,546
Do not stir up trouble again

46
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,174
with such rash behavior.

47
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:28,969
Yes, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,136
I will keep that in mind.

49
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,692
I will head to Yeongchwijeong.

50
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,236
Follow me, Mong-woo.

51
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:23,523
Have you and Kim Myung-ha
decided to repair your bond?

52
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,110
Excuse my bluntness,

53
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,947
but the Sixth Royal Secretary and I
do not share a bond worth repairing.

54
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:32,657
Then what bond do you share?

55
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:40,915
Do you not want to tell me?

56
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,503
Our ties as acquaintances
were severed long ago.

57
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:48,465
We truly have no bond to speak of.

58
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:52,260
That is a lie.

59
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,349
Kim Myung-ha was afraid
that I might fault you

60
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:59,601
and confessed to a crime
before I even inquired.

61
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:01,853
You also used me as an excuse

62
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,563
and asked me to turn a blind eye.

63
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,940
No pair would act thusly

64
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,651
without a bond between them.

65
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:10,737
Respectfully,

66
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,948
I must assure you
that I only let the matter go

67
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:15,283
so as not to disturb you further.

68
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,827
I did not intend to protect him
in the slightest.

69
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,496
It may be so for you,

70
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,414
but Kim Myung-ha

71
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,001
seemed to want a strong bond with you.

72
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:28,088
He even told you
the shortcut to Yeongchwijeong.

73
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:31,925
I apologize,

74
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:34,886
but I have no way of knowing
what he may be feeling.

75
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,680
It would be better
to question him yourself.

76
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:43,561
You no longer demand to be killed
rather than to be treated with suspicion.

77
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:48,108
I cannot risk my life
every time I sit at a <i>baduk </i>table.

78
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,871
We shall end it here today.

79
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,385
Is Grand Prince Munseong…

80
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,681
a worthy student?

81
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:23,268
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,145
Does he have talent?

83
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:26,938
Yes.

84
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,566
His attitude and motivation
are both excellent.

85
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:33,486
You may ask for anything you need.

86
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:41,494
It would be helpful to have
<i>baduk</i> game records he can refer to.

87
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:47,167
There should be some at the library
for the Grand Prince to look over.

88
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,669
I will let them know.

89
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,257
I shall leave now, Your Majesty.

90
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,496
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:28,333
Do you believe in Kim Myung-ha
and Kang Mong-woo's excuses?

92
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,295
Is there a reason not to?

93
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:36,090
They were implicated
in the false attestation three years ago,

94
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,801
where they tried to
accuse you of being a spy.

95
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,595
It is only natural to suspect them.

96
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,097
I am aware of that incident,

97
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,476
and they both know of my knowledge.

98
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,562
What could they possibly do?

99
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,647
However, Your Majesty--

100
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,441
I have already killed Mong-woo once.

101
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,821
As he has returned to me alive,

102
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,161
I intend to protect him this time
no matter what happens.

103
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,832
If he is plotting treason against you,

104
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,918
what will you do?

105
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,464
That is all the more reason
to protect him.

106
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,508
To me, a treacherous thought is loyalty.

107
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,551
Your Majesty.

108
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,596
I know what you are concerned about.

109
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,266
I shall keep that in mind and be alert.

110
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,352
Do not bring up today's incident further.

111
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

112
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,750
He seems so familiar.

113
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,460
Excuse me.

114
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:56,129
Greetings, my lord.

115
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,214
My name is Man-bok.

116
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:01,718
There is someone
who dearly wishes to meet you.

117
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,802
Please come with me.

118
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:12,061
The lord you serve

119
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:14,897
is Third Minister of Rites Yoo Hyun-bo,

120
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:17,108
- is that not right?
- Excuse me?

121
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,653
Yes, you are right.

122
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,530
I have in fact been waiting for this.

123
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,365
How fortunate.

124
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,789
A new wind will blow in the court.

125
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:34,292
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>
declined Her Royal Highness's offer

126
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,294
and sided with Her Majesty.

127
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,921
Everything will only get better
from here on out.

128
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:42,842
My lord.

129
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:45,219
Have you met the <i>gidaeryeong </i>yet?

130
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:47,513
He is not someone one can meet easily.

131
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,974
I have not even gotten a glimpse of him.

132
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,518
Come to think of it,

133
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,482
you promised to have the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
on his knees before me.

134
00:09:57,565 --> 00:09:58,941
What is taking so long?

135
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,611
I hope you are not trying to deny
saying those words.

136
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:06,658
I was afraid you would think so

137
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,911
and went ahead
and arranged this meeting today.

138
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:11,788
You mean

139
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:14,123
the guest who will be arriving soon is…

140
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,668
My lord.

141
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,336
It is me, Man-bok.

142
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,009
Why are you alone?

143
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:26,844
Where is the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

144
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:31,974
What happened?

145
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,518
My apologies, my lord.

146
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:37,188
The <i>gidaeryeong </i>refused to come
and asked me to convey his message.

147
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,607
What message?

148
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:44,153
The only person
who can order me to come and go

149
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,656
is His Majesty alone.

150
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:49,450
If he wishes to see me,

151
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,786
<i>he</i> should come to me.

152
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,919
Are those really the words of that brat?

153
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:01,587
Well…

154
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:03,589
Yes, my lord.

155
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,842
He made me repeat it several times,

156
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:08,886
saying that I must convey
the message word for word.

157
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:17,979
My lord.

158
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,273
Where exactly is the humor in this?

159
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:24,193
He is a lowly bastard, not even worthy
of the lowest possible post.

160
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:28,072
How dare he disobey
a minister-level official's summons?

161
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:33,494
Since when did the discipline
within the court become so lax?

162
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,458
That lowly bastard
just may become His Majesty's confidant.

163
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,335
Someone who has the guts to decline
Her Royal Highness's offer

164
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,880
would have no reason to be afraid of you.

165
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,217
I must leave.

166
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:52,013
Please wait, my lord.

167
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:55,266
I will immediately go
and bring him by his hair.

168
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:56,350
Let it go.

169
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,478
Do not stir up needless trouble

170
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,147
and focus on getting that
gambling den of yours disbanded.

171
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,420
Where does that brat live?

172
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,340
I hear he is staying in Banchon Village.

173
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,133
I think

174
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,428
you may be able to recognize him, my lord.

175
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:34,138
You think I would recognize him?

176
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,641
Who is he?

177
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,269
The <i>baduk </i>gambler
who should have died three years ago.

178
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,772
Hongjang's patron.

179
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:46,067
That is utter nonsense.

180
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,944
How dare you lie to me?

181
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:48,903
I am only

182
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:51,614
telling you what I have seen, my lord!

183
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,246
You must have seen a ghost

184
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:00,623
in your scatterbrained state.

185
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:13,678
You may enter.

186
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:31,904
You brat.

187
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:39,662
So it is true.

188
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,373
You survived.

189
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,169
How did you…

190
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:51,132
Does His Majesty know about this?

191
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:55,595
Of course not.

192
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:58,472
Had he known…

193
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:05,021
he would not have allowed
a government post to a traitor.

194
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:10,484
You hold office though you took off
upon hearing the news of war,

195
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:12,862
persecuted your sister, and had her killed

196
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:16,490
despite her acts of protecting her family
and staying by her mother's deathbed.

197
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:18,618
So why can I not hold one?

198
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:23,414
How dare you condemn me, you bastard?

199
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,962
Here comes His Majesty!

200
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,767
What brings you here, Hyun-bo?

201
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,311
Well…

202
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,648
Your Majesty.

203
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,776
I have important news
I must share with you.

204
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,861
It is about this man, the <i>gidaeryeong</i>--

205
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:55,863
What about him?

206
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:58,074
Your Majesty.

207
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:01,118
Do you truly not recognize him?

208
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:05,039
He is the <i>baduk </i>gambler
who gave a false attestation

209
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:08,542
to frame you as a spy three years ago.

210
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:24,392
Do you think I have lost my sanity?

211
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:26,936
No, Your Majesty.

212
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,855
I would not dare to think that.

213
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,858
It is not as if Kang Mong-woo
is wearing a mask to hide his face.

214
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,069
Unless I have lost my sanity,

215
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,905
why would I not recognize him?

216
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:44,829
Do you have anything more to say?

217
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,039
I do not.

218
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:48,457
You are dismissed.

219
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,209
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,726
I brought the game records
for the Grand Prince.

221
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:08,602
I will go see him,

222
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:10,563
so follow me.

223
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,315
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:17,403
What is going on?

225
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:22,241
Does everyone know who he is
except for me?

226
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:24,702
That cannot be.

227
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,955
If everyone had known,
the Great Lord would have known as well.

228
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,249
However, he did not seem to be aware.

229
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,255
That means His Majesty is the only one
who knows of this fact.

230
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,719
Why would he keep him by his side?

231
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,434
You always seem to find trouble
whenever you leave my sight.

232
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,810
My apologies, Your Majesty.

233
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:51,479
You are not to blame.

234
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:54,607
I am to blame for not foreseeing this.

235
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:58,027
I will command the Special Firearms Unit

236
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,862
to keep an eye on you at all times.

237
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:00,780
That is that.

238
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,033
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,418
Why are you keeping quiet, Grand Prince?

240
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,712
You should express your gratitude
to His Majesty.

241
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:23,844
Your Majesty,

242
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:26,514
may I truly accept this?

243
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,266
Why do you ask me such a question?

244
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:31,352
This book contains

245
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,063
the record of <i>baduk </i>games

246
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:37,566
between my late father and you.

247
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:41,112
It is far too valuable for me to read.

248
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,198
You may accept it.

249
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,535
I brought it here to give to you.

250
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,204
Your Majesty.

251
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,873
After I have learned much
from the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

252
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:54,375
and become a proficient player,

253
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,338
may I request a game of <i>baduk</i> with you?

254
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,007
As my late father passed away
when I was too young,

255
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,136
I do not have much memory of him.

256
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:10,599
I would like to hear your stories of him
over a game of <i>baduk</i>.

257
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:11,600
Grand Prince,

258
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:14,436
you are being impertinent
with an abrupt request.

259
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,646
Be quiet, Princess.

260
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,731
My apologies, Your Majesty.

261
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,112
If you wish to play <i>baduk </i>with me,

262
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,698
being proficient is not enough.

263
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:27,867
You must be as good as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

264
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:29,618
What do you think?

265
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:31,871
Do you see his potential?

266
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,040
If one pours their heart and soul into it,

267
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,126
there is no obstacle one cannot overcome.

268
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,795
If His Highness gives it his best,

269
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:43,340
he will one day become
an even better <i>baduk </i>player than me.

270
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,467
All right.

271
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,429
I will promise you a game,

272
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,265
as Mong-woo has vouched for you.

273
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,770
Your Majesty, I have one more request.

274
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:57,771
Grand Prince.

275
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,316
What is it?

276
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,401
I…

277
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,446
would like to accompany you
on your upcoming journey.

278
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:12,453
This is the first <i>gisinje</i>
after the mourning period.

279
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,413
As the late king's son,

280
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:16,123
I would like to honor him.

281
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:19,251
I implore you to grant my request.

282
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:36,602
You cannot enter.
He ordered to keep people away!

283
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:40,105
My lord.

284
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:42,691
What insolence is this?

285
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,070
I have an urgent matter
to report to the Principal Director.

286
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:48,239
You may leave.

287
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:52,826
Make sure

288
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,579
to report this list
to His Majesty yourself.

289
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,789
I will, Lord Park.

290
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:06,131
You will regret it
if you do not hear this news.

291
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,676
It is about the identity
of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

292
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,685
The identity of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

293
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,067
You were not aware, just as I thought.

294
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:28,821
However, His Majesty was aware of it.

295
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,241
You may leave us.

296
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:44,962
My lord.

297
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,131
I have a request to make

298
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,466
before I share this news.

299
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,011
There is an old saying

300
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:54,638
that a well-fed dog
bites the hand that fed it.

301
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,725
While witnessing Kim Jong-bae's demise,

302
00:20:58,434 --> 00:20:59,518
I made a vow to myself

303
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,271
that regardless of your flattery,

304
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:05,232
I would not feed you
under any circumstances.

305
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:10,738
So…

306
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:14,616
what of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>'s identity?

307
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:24,752
Your Majesty.

308
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:28,339
That is the list of officials
who will <i>baejong </i>you on your journey.

309
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:30,049
BAEJONG: ACCOMPANYING THE KING

310
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:35,637
So many officials are unnecessary
when we are trying to reduce the cost.

311
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,723
Reduce the number by more than half…

312
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,143
and add Grand Prince Munseong to the list.

313
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:48,817
Your Majesty.

314
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:52,488
I advise you not to take
Grand Prince Munseong with you.

315
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,490
The journey will be arduous,

316
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:58,035
and this one in particular will not allow
his servants to accompany him.

317
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,996
It will be too taxing
for the young Grand Prince.

318
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:02,831
The Grand Prince

319
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:06,043
is old enough to handle the difficulties
of traveling for filial duty.

320
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,213
Do not worry about his caretaker.

321
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,632
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo will serve him.

322
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,061
He has never had
the Grand Prince accompany him.

323
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:27,731
Why is His Majesty taking him this time?

324
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:29,358
You are wrong.

325
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,277
The Grand Prince is a pretext
to take the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

326
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,613
That is ridiculous.

327
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,865
We shall see if I am right or not.

328
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,458
<i>Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo</i>

329
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,252
is the <i>baduk </i>gambler

330
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:51,880
who tried to harm His Majesty
with a false attestation three years ago.

331
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:56,009
<i>He is also the man His Majesty kept close
before ascending to the throne.</i>

332
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:02,266
Myung-ha! Hold on!

333
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:09,898
You know who Kang Mong-woo really is,
do you not?

334
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,734
What do you mean by that?

335
00:23:12,818 --> 00:23:16,822
You warned me not to get too close
to Kang Mong-woo.

336
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,949
You must have said that for a reason.

337
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,369
Why? Did someone say something?

338
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,622
Yoo Hyun-bo was eagerly claiming

339
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,375
that he had news regarding him
for the Principal Director.

340
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,423
What is going on?

341
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:35,883
Myung-ha!

342
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:49,938
Greetings, Sixth Royal Secretary.

343
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,027
I am alone.

344
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,322
I came out of concern.

345
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:02,201
I hear Yoo Hyun-bo has been telling others
about your identity.

346
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,037
Are you all right?

347
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:06,580
Do not worry.

348
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:10,709
Yoo Hyun-bo only started talking
at the perfect time as I had intended.

349
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,171
What do you mean by the perfect time?

350
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,550
Did you also intend

351
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:20,844
the Grand Prince's matter?

352
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:25,474
Could you ask
if I can accompany His Majesty

353
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:27,142
on his journey this year?

354
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:32,689
Why do you not ask him yourself,
Your Highness?

355
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,945
Are you afraid?

356
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:44,117
It requires bravery
to be resolute despite being afraid.

357
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:46,286
Be brave.

358
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:50,624
That way, you will not have any regrets
even if you fail.

359
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,630
<i>It is too dangerous.</i>

360
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:01,134
It is fortunate that the King
assented without becoming furious,

361
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,845
but the Queen Dowager
and Park Jong-hwan will not sit back.

362
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:06,139
One cannot plot against the throne

363
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:08,141
without taking any risks.

364
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:11,603
Moreover, the true dangers

365
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:14,064
have already taken place.

366
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,361
The King ascended to the throne
after murdering your father,

367
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,196
Hongjang died,

368
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:24,116
and all contact with my father was lost

369
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,368
after he was taken
to Shenyang as a prisoner.

370
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:30,872
Do you not agree?

371
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,626
I am sure

372
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:37,212
your father is still alive.

373
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:40,382
If he were,
he would have returned at all costs.

374
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:43,176
- My lady.
- Do not call me that.

375
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:47,389
Kang Hee-soo died three years ago.

376
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:50,267
I am now…

377
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,186
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

378
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,862
Sever all your emotional ties
to Kang Hee-soo.

379
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,072
If you do not do so,

380
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:06,033
my plans and means will lose power,

381
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,743
and we will fall in danger.

382
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:09,578
If you are referring to the last time,

383
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,331
do not worry.

384
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,083
I promise not to make another mistake.

385
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,919
The King said
he would not make an issue out of it.

386
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:20,589
He is already suspicious of us.

387
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:23,508
He may be laying down traps

388
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,178
just as he did three years ago.

389
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,729
I will not be deceived
by his trickery again.

390
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,066
Make your decision.

391
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,455
You cannot take
Grand Prince Munseong with you.

392
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:57,000
It will disturb the peace of the court
and bring about disaster.

393
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:00,504
If the peace of the court
is disturbed by a child like him,

394
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,548
then it is not true peace.

395
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:06,343
Your Majesty.

396
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,805
Do you truly not understand
what I am concerned about?

397
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:13,433
Ill rumors are still going around
among the people as is.

398
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:16,395
There is no reason to start another one.

399
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:17,813
By ill rumors,

400
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:23,276
do you mean the one about
how I murdered my own brother?

401
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:29,116
That is all the more reason
for me to take the Grand Prince with me.

402
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,785
The people should see with their own eyes

403
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:35,705
that I am close to him
for the rumors to dissipate.

404
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,254
Do not worry.

405
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:46,049
Letting one child accompany me
will not cause any trouble.

406
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:59,229
There is one question
that I cannot seem to solve.

407
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:03,066
How is it that Grand Prince Munseong
is still alive?

408
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:05,068
To dispose of him,

409
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:08,321
we must tread carefully while gauging
the scholars' and the people's sentiments.

410
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:09,656
Otherwise,

411
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,741
the moment we move against him,

412
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,411
His Majesty and the royal family
will fall under suspicion.

413
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:18,707
Continue speaking.

414
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,500
When the time is right,

415
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,170
I shall have the Grand Prince
leave the palace

416
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,338
and carry out the duty.

417
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:32,345
This chaos arose after Gidaeryeong Kang
was named his <i>baduk </i>tutor.

418
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:37,309
I sought to get rid of trouble
but ended up causing more.

419
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:42,731
Why can you not win the King's heart

420
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:45,484
when even that lowly man could so easily?

421
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,986
His Majesty

422
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:52,991
is suspecting me
of murdering the late king.

423
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:56,953
My brother was poisoned to death.

424
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,544
Tell me, who did it?

425
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:09,758
<i>Are you saying</i>

426
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,887
that is the reason why the King
is wary of his one and only uncle?

427
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:16,264
Even if that were to be true,

428
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:18,642
the King ascended to the throne
thanks to you.

429
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:21,102
I am sure there is another reason.

430
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,438
I apologize,

431
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:26,691
but there cannot be any other reason.

432
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,200
What will you do about Kang Mong-woo?

433
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,788
Let us keep an eye on him
for the time being.

434
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:43,959
He might be more useful than I expected.

435
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:22,956
I would like to accompany you
on your upcoming journey.

436
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:25,709
This is the first <i>gisinje</i>
after the mourning period.

437
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:27,669
As the late king's son,

438
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,462
I would like to honor him.

439
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:33,842
Your Majesty.

440
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:37,679
Captain Joo Sang-hwa
of the Special Firearms Unit is here.

441
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:38,972
Let him in.

442
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,199
Your Majesty, did you summon me?

443
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:01,369
Are your men still tailing Kang Mong-woo?

444
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:02,370
No, Your Majesty.

445
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,290
I withdrew the order
after confirming where he was staying.

446
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:07,334
Shall I command them to keep tailing him?

447
00:31:09,294 --> 00:31:10,337
Tail one more person.

448
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,131
Have them follow Yoo Hyun-bo as well.

449
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,593
Not Kim Myung-ha, but Yoo Hyun-bo?

450
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:17,636
Yes.

451
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:20,096
Third Minister of Rites Yoo Hyun-bo.

452
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:23,892
As you wish, Your Majesty.

453
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:17,153
I will double the amount if you succeed.

454
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,115
Who shall I take care of?

455
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,869
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

456
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:29,290
Make sure he cannot play <i>baduk</i> ever again.

457
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,759
My lady.

458
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,970
The guest you have been
waiting for is here.

459
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,596
Let them in.

460
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:47,809
- My lady.
- Bun-yeong.

461
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:55,150
We finally meet
despite working in a close vicinity.

462
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:58,528
They say the inner palace
is the most secluded place for a reason.

463
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,321
Thank you for last time.

464
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,449
You really helped me out.

465
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,327
Since you praise me so much,

466
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,621
I am utterly at a loss for words.

467
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:12,584
Have Master Chu and Se-dong returned?

468
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,085
Not yet.

469
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:16,463
It looks like they will take longer.

470
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,090
My lady.

471
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,551
Then may we bring food out
for Bun-yeong first?

472
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:23,303
Yes, you may.

473
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,350
What is all this?

474
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:32,312
What do you think?

475
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:36,274
I cooked with all my heart
for my dear daughter.

476
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:40,153
Here.

477
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,863
Eat up.

478
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:48,203
It finally feels like I am eating.

479
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:49,871
What?

480
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:52,624
Do they still eat meals without you?

481
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,752
That is not it, Mother.

482
00:33:56,795 --> 00:34:00,673
My stomach feels empty
no matter how much I eat in the palace.

483
00:34:00,757 --> 00:34:02,717
Such is the life of any on the payroll.

484
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:06,554
By the way,

485
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,850
your stipend from last month
was much lower than usual.

486
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,689
I am sorry, Mother.

487
00:34:17,273 --> 00:34:18,733
I was trying to spend less, but…

488
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:23,530
Her using what small wage she could
to win people's hearts

489
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:26,407
is what allowed her
to help Lady Hee-soo out.

490
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:29,244
Fine, I get it.

491
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:31,704
My goodness.

492
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,290
You have grown a lot, Jageunnyeon.

493
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:37,627
I used to outrank you by far
on having a glib tongue.

494
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:40,922
You should change your name
to Keunnyeon, as in mature woman.

495
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,424
I will treat you with due deference
to an older sister.

496
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:45,802
Your acknowledgment is enough,
little sister.

497
00:34:45,885 --> 00:34:47,637
Goodness me.

498
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,805
Eat up.

499
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,038
You were right.

500
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,039
However,

501
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,710
allow me some time
as it will not be an easy task.

502
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:21,504
Time to let go of my feelings, that is.

503
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,090
Feelings for whom?

504
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:27,969
Why?

505
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:31,264
- What is the matter?
- You startled me!

506
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:33,683
Gosh, my apologies.

507
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:36,644
I will tread with sound
and cough next time.

508
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:46,237
What is with him?
Why is he acting so strangely?

509
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:50,116
Do not tell me

510
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,494
he still has feelings
for Lord Kang Hang-soon's daughter.

511
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:58,374
It appears so.

512
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:02,545
I thought he had moved on
as he did not ask after her,

513
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,422
but he still must not have done so.

514
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:08,343
What brings you here, my lord?

515
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,887
- Are you here for the <i>baduk </i>table?
- Yes.

516
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,473
No, that is not it.

517
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:15,266
I came to advise you on something.

518
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,810
As you will be accompanying
the Grand Prince on the journey,

519
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:19,520
it would be good to know this in advance.

520
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:31,908
<i>Around the time of the</i> gisinje <i>each year,
His Majesty's behavior becomes erratic.</i>

521
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,035
-<i>It is so extreme</i>
-Please forgive me!

522
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:37,872
<i>that some even wonder
if it is not some seasonal insanity.</i>

523
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,792
<i>He becomes furious
over the smallest blunders.</i>

524
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:43,127
<i>Even Senior Court Lady Dong,
His Majesty's favorite,</i>

525
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:44,921
<i>treads lightly during this time.</i>

526
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:51,177
Is His Majesty well?

527
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:55,598
<i>He refuses to eat and drink
and stays in Yeongchwijeong day and night.</i>

528
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:58,559
<i>Court officials implored him
to come out several times.</i>

529
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,232
<i>Then he would suddenly
take the Special Firearms Unit</i>

530
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:06,651
<i>and leave the palace without a word,</i>

531
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,696
<i>turning the palace upside down.</i>

532
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:14,617
Are you saying he suddenly behaves so
without showing any signs earlier?

533
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,702
There had been a sign.

534
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:16,828
In fact, it is…

535
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:22,125
Actually, I visited the
Royal Astronomical Observatory earlier,

536
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:24,168
and they said he would be fine this year.

537
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:29,090
But we should still be careful
as another outburst may hit us whenever.

538
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,397
I came to escort His Highness.

539
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,609
Come on out, Grand Prince.

540
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,417
Master.

541
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,004
Your Highness.

542
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,674
Did you just call me your master?

543
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:12,800
Yes.

544
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,552
<i>Baduk </i>is a long journey of learning,

545
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:17,221
which makes you my master.

546
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,517
Shall we?

547
00:38:42,372 --> 00:38:43,539
Your Highness.

548
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,126
Principal Director.

549
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:50,421
Gidaeryeong.

550
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,632
This is Lord Park Jong-hwan.
Show your respect.

551
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,596
Greetings to you, Principal Director.

552
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:01,474
I am Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

553
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,943
Please look after His Highness.

554
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,547
The Principal Director
came to see you, Master.

555
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,967
I am aware, Your Highness.

556
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,892
Lady Hee-soo sure is something.

557
00:39:44,976 --> 00:39:47,895
She is accompanying His Majesty
on a journey only a select few can join.

558
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:49,897
She is indeed a lady of her word.

559
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:50,982
Do you not agree?

560
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:02,368
By the way, where did Master Chu
leave so early in the morning?

561
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:04,829
How am I supposed to know?

562
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,456
I did not even notice him leaving.

563
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,585
It is her memorial day in a few days.

564
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:13,754
My goodness.

565
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:15,548
It is Hongjang's memorial day.

566
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,926
Without a grave
to perform a memorial service to,

567
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,262
I keep forgetting the date every year.

568
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:23,890
What do you mean there is no grave?

569
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:26,559
Master Chu's heart
is her grave and shrine.

570
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:32,356
You are right.

571
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:16,442
Chief Royal Secretary, what is going on?

572
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:17,735
Where is His Majesty?

573
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:19,862
I cannot tell you his whereabouts.

574
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:21,155
How dare you?

575
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,823
You still call yourself
the Chief Royal Secretary?

576
00:41:23,324 --> 00:41:24,659
Great Lord, please calm down.

577
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:25,868
You back off!

578
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:29,121
Seeing how composed
the Chief Royal Secretary looks,

579
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,123
His Majesty is well.

580
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,961
I am sure he will return before midnight.

581
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,327
Do not attack.

582
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:10,955
I bring a letter for His Majesty.

583
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:18,504
The man before you is His Majesty.

584
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:23,259
It is a great honor
for a lowly man like me to meet you!

585
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,427
You may stand.

586
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:30,850
You have a letter for me?

587
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,060
I do, Your Majesty.

588
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:56,334
Thank you for the letter.

589
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,170
As I shall find what is lost at all costs,

590
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:02,131
make sure you tell them not to worry.

591
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:04,675
Yes, Your Majesty.

592
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,761
I shall make my way back, Your Majesty.

593
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:16,539
I want to play the game as well.

594
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:18,666
Forgive me, Your Highness.

595
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:21,085
They are not playing but training.

596
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:25,506
His Majesty commanded them
to train like in a real match.

597
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:28,384
As such, he only discouraged you
from playing out of concern.

598
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:29,844
Please do not be disappointed.

599
00:44:32,263 --> 00:44:34,098
I shall tour the grounds with my master.

600
00:44:37,143 --> 00:44:38,185
Your Highness.

601
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:50,948
Your Highness.

602
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,244
I asked with the full knowledge
that I could not play.

603
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:58,080
This is my first time
away from the palace,

604
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,332
and I wished to do something memorable.

605
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,871
All right! Any more challengers?

606
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:42,541
- Challenge him!
- Challenge him!

607
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:45,044
- Challenge him!
- Challenge him!

608
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:51,884
We have a challenger!

609
00:45:53,344 --> 00:45:56,096
The Grand Prince and the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
are there, Your Majesty.

610
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:10,694
I have no intention of challenging you.

611
00:46:29,588 --> 00:46:30,464
If you give up,

612
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:32,174
we shall count it toward your loss.

613
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:35,719
Let us go easy.

614
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,304
Easy.

615
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:04,873
<i>When holding a sword,</i>

616
00:47:04,957 --> 00:47:06,750
<i>you must be on your guard at all times.</i>

617
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:40,367
You are exceptional, Master!

618
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:44,622
- Challenge him!
- Challenge him!

619
00:47:44,705 --> 00:47:51,045
- Challenge him!
- Challenge him!

620
00:47:51,128 --> 00:47:52,296
- Challenge him!
- Challenge him!

621
00:47:58,344 --> 00:47:59,678
One game is enough for me.

622
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:02,014
I will stop here.

623
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:21,909
You acted all high and mighty.

624
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:23,535
Do not act weak now.

625
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:26,664
Let us finish this.

626
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:39,009
Your Majesty!

627
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,179
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

628
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:43,847
Your Majesty.

629
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:56,735
Master, are you all right?

630
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,993
Your Majesty.

631
00:49:07,162 --> 00:49:10,833
I did command you to train
as if you were fighting our enemies,

632
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,585
but I did not expect you
to obey my command so well.

633
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:16,338
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>'s frame
is much smaller than yours.

634
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,465
As such, I shall face you.

635
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:20,050
Pardon?

636
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:25,264
How could I dare
to wield a sword against you?

637
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:27,766
That cannot happen.

638
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,226
I will allow it.

639
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:31,687
Wield your sword as you please.

640
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:38,569
Your Majesty.

641
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:40,696
No, this is too dangerous.

642
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:46,452
Step back.

643
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:06,513
You may attack me first.

644
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:15,481
Put your heart into it.

645
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:42,841
This is why I tried to hold him back.

646
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:50,349
Are you injured?

647
00:50:51,558 --> 00:50:53,227
This is a great honor, Your Majesty.

648
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,103
I am not injured at all.

649
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:00,526
You train…

650
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:04,154
to protect yourself

651
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,366
as well as your comrades.

652
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:11,495
You must care for your comrades

653
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:14,248
as much as yourself
to survive on the battlefield

654
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:15,541
and become the victor.

655
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,794
No matter how exceptional you are,

656
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:22,297
should you look down on
and injure your comrade senselessly,

657
00:51:23,006 --> 00:51:24,883
your action will be
considered insubordination

658
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:26,760
and punished harshly.

659
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:28,011
Do you understand?

660
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:30,055
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

661
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:48,490
What were you doing here?

662
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:49,950
Your Majesty.

663
00:51:50,534 --> 00:51:52,536
I asked him if he could show me around.

664
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,669
It is time for <i>gisinje </i>soon.

665
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:02,713
You will be held accountable

666
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,923
after we have returned to the palace, so…

667
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:10,929
What is the matter?

668
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,735
You are bleeding.

669
00:52:26,612 --> 00:52:28,071
I am fine, Your Majesty.

670
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:29,489
That is ridiculous.

671
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:30,908
Bring the royal physician immediately.

672
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:31,909
Yes, Your Majesty.

673
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:44,784
Are you all right, Your Highness?

674
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:47,453
I rushed here upon hearing the news
of a royal physician being summoned.

675
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,748
My master was injured, and not me.

676
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,502
Are you saying Kang Mong-woo was injured?

677
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,171
Captain Joo, where is the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

678
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:02,051
He is being treated
by the royal physician in there.

679
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,262
Wait, is that not…

680
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:06,889
His Majesty's residence?

681
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:11,853
Are you saying he allowed
the <i>gidaeryeong </i>to enter his residence?

682
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:14,063
Yes.

683
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,283
What do you mean
you do not want to be treated?

684
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:27,785
This injury was inflicted

685
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,247
by a patrolman's sword three years ago.

686
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:34,333
As you are aware,

687
00:53:35,126 --> 00:53:37,503
even a physician cannot do much
for such a wound.

688
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:40,798
And that is why you refuse?

689
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:44,677
As it is but an old wound acting up,

690
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,555
I should get better with some rest.

691
00:53:56,147 --> 00:53:57,273
Your Majesty.

692
00:53:57,356 --> 00:54:01,277
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha
seeks your audience.

693
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,361
Let him in.

694
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:15,166
Your Majesty, you must leave now.

695
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,209
It is almost midnight.

696
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:26,552
This is a royal command.

697
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:28,763
Tend to Gidaeryeong's wound.

698
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:31,182
Yes, Your Majesty.

699
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:46,906
You heard His Majesty.

700
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:48,449
Please show me your wound.

701
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,209
Please take this back.

702
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,213
I will reward you
three times the agreed amount.

703
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:04,757
I cannot do it
even if you offer a fortune.

704
00:55:05,257 --> 00:55:08,177
I will pretend none of it ever happened,
so do not seek me again.

705
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:52,430
You are bleeding.

706
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:54,390
I am fine, Your Majesty.

707
00:55:54,473 --> 00:55:55,725
That is ridiculous.

708
00:55:55,808 --> 00:55:57,184
Bring the royal physician immediately.

709
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:58,185
Yes, Your Majesty.

710
00:56:14,827 --> 00:56:16,746
How was the treatment for Kang Mong-woo?

711
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:17,830
Did he…

712
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:21,208
show his wound willingly?

713
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:28,049
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have treated him well.

714
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:30,676
I see.

715
00:56:32,428 --> 00:56:33,637
That is a relief.

716
00:56:38,684 --> 00:56:40,853
Please, Royal Physician Ji.

717
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:44,690
Please tell His Majesty
that you have finished treating me.

718
00:56:44,774 --> 00:56:48,277
I did promise Master Choam to aid you,

719
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,862
but this is a royal command.

720
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:51,655
I cannot go against his command.

721
00:56:52,281 --> 00:56:53,783
I will take responsibility.

722
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:56,744
There will not be any issues.

723
00:56:58,954 --> 00:57:00,623
Let me at least apply some ointment.

724
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,125
If you give it to me,

725
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,045
I shall do so after resting.

726
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:09,840
As you wish.

727
00:59:26,477 --> 00:59:27,520
Brother.

728
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:32,316
I shall liberate myself
from the pain of the past

729
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,861
and prepare for what is yet to come.

730
00:59:39,156 --> 00:59:41,784
No amount of fear and disgrace

731
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:45,663
will be able to stop me.

732
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:53,837
Please do watch over me
until the very end.

733
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,015
Goodness!

734
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:48,225
This is troubling!

735
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,603
What is the matter?

736
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:51,645
Drizzle.

737
01:00:52,187 --> 01:00:54,315
This is the sign
that drives His Majesty into insanity.

738
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:57,067
I must inform the officials.

739
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:07,703
This drizzle

740
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:10,539
is the sign that leads to his insanity?

741
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:16,045
It cannot be.

742
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:29,516
<i>From now on,</i>

743
01:01:31,518 --> 01:01:32,353
you are Mongwoo.

744
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:37,358
My <i>manghyeongjiu</i>,

745
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:39,943
<i>Mongwoo.</i>

746
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:41,213
Why are you outside?

747
01:02:43,173 --> 01:02:44,216
The rain…

748
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:49,096
It is drizzling.

749
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:55,185
Indeed.

750
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:59,940
It has been a while
since we had a <i>mongwoo</i>.

751
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:16,331
We will catch a cold. Let us go in.

752
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:26,884
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

753
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:39,938
You dislike me.

754
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:45,819
No, Your Majesty.

755
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:51,784
Do you like me then?

756
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:05,047
I do.

757
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:13,305
I…

758
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:22,773
like you, Mong-woo.

759
01:04:57,474 --> 01:05:00,227
CAPTIVATING THE KING

760
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:03,522
Do you not mind the rumors going around?

761
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:06,859
<i>Even if anyone dares to
condemn me for being attracted to men</i>

762
01:05:06,942 --> 01:05:08,485
and laugh at me to my face,

763
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:10,863
<i>I, too, will laugh aloud with them.</i>

764
01:05:11,446 --> 01:05:13,657
<i>Is there a way to stop the rumors?</i>

765
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,160
The most certain way
is to expel the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

766
01:05:17,244 --> 01:05:20,372
What harm did Kang Mong-woo inflict on me?

767
01:05:20,998 --> 01:05:24,626
<i>Senior Court Lady Dong is officially
spending the night with His Majesty.</i>

768
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:27,713
I have severed my emotional ties.

769
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:30,215
<i>Now, it is your turn.</i>

770
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:34,469
Comb through the capital
and find Kang Mong-woo.

771
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:38,849
<i>I only had eyes for you
and wanted you from the outset.</i>
