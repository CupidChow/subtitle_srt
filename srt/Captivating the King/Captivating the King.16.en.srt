Come on now.

13
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,668
Your Royal Highness.

14
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:56,712
Forgive me,

15
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,174
but being His Majesty's <i>gidaeryeong</i>
is enough for me.

16
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:06,473
Who gave you
the permission to take it off?

17
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,438
Your distasteful habit
of not listening while I am being civil

18
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:17,359
slipped my mind.

19
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,112
Do not just stand about!

20
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:22,406
Strip her of this unseemly men's attire.

21
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:29,121
Let me go!

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,793
Here comes His Majesty.

23
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:45,262
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,102
Mother.

25
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:54,938
What is going on here?

26
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,610
Greetings, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,753
Order them to let go of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

28
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:19,504
right this instant.

29
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:20,505
Your Majesty.

30
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,049
Please allow me a moment.

31
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:25,552
I was about to have her
try on the perfect outfit

32
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:27,846
I bestowed upon her.

33
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:33,810
If you do not order them
to release her, I will have to.

34
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,773
Shall I have all your servants
dragged out of your quarters?

35
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:49,952
Senior Court Lady Han.

36
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:54,081
Release the <i>gidaeryeong </i>and leave.

37
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,263
You may leave as well, Mong-woo.

38
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:13,725
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,522
Word has it

40
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:22,275
that the Qing Emperor
wants to play <i>baduk </i>with her.

41
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,784
I will relieve you of this distress.

42
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,163
Appoint the <i>gidaeryeong </i>as a concubine.

43
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,666
Not even the Emperor of the Qing

44
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:41,628
can summon the spouse
of Joseon's King at his will.

45
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:50,595
That idea eluded me.

46
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,473
All the better,

47
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:57,019
I could make her the new occupant
of the queen's quarters.

48
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,604
What do you think, Mother?

49
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:08,196
How is it that you are responding
to my concerns with a jape?

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,823
Were you not japing?

51
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,285
In that case, let me be clear.

52
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,662
I will not

53
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:19,124
send the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
to the Emperor of the Qing

54
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,169
or appoint her as my concubine.

55
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,302
If you thought you could control me

56
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:33,221
by using the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,

57
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,973
I advise you to perish the thought.

58
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,058
Do you think

59
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:40,103
I want that wicked and deceiving wench
as your future spouse

60
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:41,813
out of my fondness for her?

61
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:45,650
You must sire a son
who will inherit the throne

62
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,736
and preserve your legacy.

63
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,238
I already have a son.

64
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,366
The Crown Prince is the late king's son,

65
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,076
not yours.

66
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,870
Do you not remember
how the late king persecuted us?

67
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:58,622
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

68
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:04,086
If he ascends to the throne,
a bloodbath will be inevitable.

69
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,882
That will happen when I am dead and gone.

70
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,468
There is nothing I can do about that.

71
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,433
If that is what you truly want, then fine.

72
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,728
I will no longer

73
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,022
reside in the palace with you.

74
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,608
If I leave the palace,

75
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:32,614
the whole nation will learn
that you are the most undutiful son.

76
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:34,825
Do you truly believe

77
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:38,078
your authority will hold
even while going against my will?

78
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,711
It will not do

79
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,006
to have you leave the palace.

80
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,721
I shall <i>ieo</i> myself.

81
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:58,014
IEO: RELOCATION OF THE KING'S RESIDENCE

82
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,182
Your Majesty!

83
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:01,017
Promise me one thing.

84
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,060
Do not…

85
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,480
summon the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

86
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,816
under any circumstances.

87
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,695
Gidaeryeong Kang
should only answer to my calls.

88
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,541
I shall leave now.

89
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:40,223
How could you
treat your mother so harshly?

90
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:54,154
How could you be this cruel
to your own mother?

91
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:00,493
Were you hurt

92
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,373
because of my refusal
to appoint you as my concubine?

93
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,461
If you had ordered me

94
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,298
to abandon my current post
and become your concubine,

95
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,134
I would have resented you

96
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,637
and cut you out of my life.

97
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,353
I almost stepped right into trouble.

98
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:29,481
To speak the truth,

99
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:35,320
my mother's words
did sway me for a moment.

100
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,450
What made you change your mind?

101
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,119
I selfishly desired

102
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:46,957
to have you confined to the palace
so you would only see and think about me.

103
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,629
It seemed as if my mother
had seen through me, which shamed me.

104
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,674
And only then could I think straight.

105
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:03,014
When were you planning to tell me

106
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,725
that the Emperor had summoned me?

107
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,437
I was never going to tell you.

108
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:12,566
I have no intention
of sending you away anyway.

109
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:17,487
- Your Majesty.
- My mind has been set.

110
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,197
Do not try to argue with me.

111
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:32,168
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,548
If you do not send
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo to the Qing,

113
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:39,843
they may use the execution
of the Principal Director as a pretext

114
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,511
and pressure you further.

115
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,434
I cannot sacrifice the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

116
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,936
to evade their unreasonable requests
and interference.

117
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,064
Punishing the Principal Director

118
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,525
has improved public sentiment,

119
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,862
but there is another challenge
that is yet to be overcome.

120
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,035
It is Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

121
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:10,290
Your Majesty, I implore you.

122
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,792
Send the <i>gidaeryeong</i> to the Qing

123
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,836
and issue a decree
for the selection of the queen.

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,672
If you select a new queen,

125
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,425
the people will trust
and follow you wholly.

126
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,427
Only then

127
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,431
can we abolish the Border Defense Council
without the court's resistance

128
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:30,810
as you have desired and reform the court.

129
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,397
Please reconsider your decision.

130
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:51,706
<i>Master Choam.</i>

131
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,625
Thank you.

132
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,586
I did not make the request for you.

133
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,674
I only offered His Majesty my advice

134
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,468
as I did not think
you should remain by his side.

135
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:07,305
That was why I asked you to advise him.

136
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,891
Without sincerity,

137
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,727
no advice can bend his will.

138
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,400
I do not know

139
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,903
what decision he will come to.

140
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,572
His Majesty

141
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:29,285
knows the truth in your words
better than anyone.

142
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,496
Though it may take some time,

143
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,666
he will make the right decision.

144
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:46,052
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

145
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,220
You may enter.

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,651
How did it go?

147
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,696
I conveyed your order
to Senior Court Lady Han.

148
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,574
I told her that should a rumor
that the <i>gidaeryeong</i> is a woman spread,

149
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,576
she would be expelled
and punished severely

150
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,203
as the Queen Dowager's quarters
would be assumed the rumor's origin.

151
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,706
She said she would take it to her grave.

152
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,710
Is there any news about Jung Je-pyo?

153
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,920
After voyaging across the nation,

154
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:23,423
he has been staying
in Iksan Magistracy for the last few days.

155
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,427
Observe the people he meets
and their topics of discussion

156
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,096
and report back to me.

157
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,347
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:50,116
Your Majesty.

159
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,119
I have a question.

160
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:54,829
What is it?

161
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:59,125
Punishing the Principal Director

162
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,712
equates to declaring war against the Qing.

163
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,174
But they offered peace

164
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:09,636
by requesting you to send me
instead of invading with their troops.

165
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:11,763
It is strange.

166
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:19,187
It means they cannot mobilize
their troops at their will.

167
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:24,400
They would have to engage
with the remaining forces of the Ming,

168
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,529
and the young Emperor and Prince Rui

169
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,031
may have begun their struggle for power.

170
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,284
Your Majesty.

171
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,204
I will go to the Emperor.

172
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:41,209
I will look into the situation
they are in.

173
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,630
Did I not tell you already
that I would not be sending you away?

174
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,133
Do you think they would accept that
without a challenge?

175
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,888
Finding a way to take advantage
of the situation would be preferable,

176
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:54,973
would it not?

177
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,350
Do you think they will not
see through your intent?

178
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,686
They will consider you a spy,

179
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,563
keep their eyes on you at all times,

180
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,190
and find any means to persecute you.

181
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,109
Why do you insist on taking the risk?

182
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,320
Because I would be leaving to play <i>baduk</i>

183
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,906
and it would be the Qing Emperor
I would converse with there.

184
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,367
Should I earn his goodwill,

185
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,869
I would gain means
to aid you and this nation.

186
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,998
There is no reason for me
to hesitate or dread it.

187
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:27,797
- No.
- Your Majesty.

188
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,511
There is another reason I must go.

189
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,767
I wish to see

190
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,145
my long-yearned father in Beijing.

191
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,380
I failed to protect you three years ago.

192
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:13,051
But even after three years,

193
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:17,555
I am no different
in that I still cannot protect you.

194
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:25,146
Why must I, even as the king,

195
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,194
face continued failures in protecting you?

196
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:39,369
Your Majesty.

197
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,670
You have my approval.

198
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,464
You may leave to the Qing.

199
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:01,599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:06,729
I shall…

201
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,442
live up to your expectations.

202
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,099
Do not make those faces.

203
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,685
I am not going there as a criminal

204
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:47,729
but as the Emperor's guest.

205
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:49,355
They may call you their guest,

206
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,733
but who knows how they will treat you?

207
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:53,901
My lady.

208
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,739
Does that mean
you are going as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

209
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,367
I must step down from the post when I go.

210
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:07,665
And yet His Majesty gave you
his approval for you to go to the Qing?

211
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,709
I asked for his approval myself.

212
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,003
I would like to see my father as well.

213
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,634
I might as well take this opportunity
and join Lady Hee-soo

214
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:21,637
to see how Bun-yeong is doing
and go sightseeing in Beijing.

215
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,182
I will be traveling
with the envoy's group,

216
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,934
so I can only take two other people.

217
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:28,811
Then Jageunnyeon should stay.

218
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:31,355
Yes, it would be better for us to go.

219
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,067
There will be loads to pack.

220
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,110
When are we leaving?

221
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,280
We will be leaving in a month's time.

222
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:41,532
A month's time…

223
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:47,872
I cannot send Mong-woo to the Qing alone.

224
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,876
How about you select a few men
from my unit to watch over her?

225
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,754
There is someone
more suited for that role.

226
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,465
Do you mean Chu Dal-ha?

227
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,513
I shall order the Chief Royal Secretary

228
00:17:03,596 --> 00:17:06,349
to prepare a royal decree
granting him amnesty.

229
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,268
Go and deliver it
as soon as the document is prepared.

230
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:10,853
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,553
I hear my days in exile came to a close.

232
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,222
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>

233
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,683
will be leaving for Beijing.

234
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:53,604
His Majesty granted you amnesty
so you could watch over her.

235
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,621
What is it?

236
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,373
I apologize,

237
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,710
but could I ask for a few days' time?

238
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,796
I must tie up a loose end.

239
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,214
It is Yoo Hyun-bo, is it not?

240
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:24,969
Do you plan to kill him?

241
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:33,019
Killing an exiled criminal
for personal reasons

242
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,313
is against this nation's law.

243
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:40,026
You would be committing another crime
against His Majesty despite his kindness.

244
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:48,659
You have three days.

245
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:50,786
That is it.

246
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,517
I was wondering where you went.

247
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,770
I see you went to get some wood.

248
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,273
It was so cold at night

249
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:22,235
that I almost froze to death.

250
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,070
Start the fire to heat the floor.

251
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:27,073
There will be no heating
until winter frost sets in.

252
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:30,368
Do remember this is not some
luxurious residence, will you?

253
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,827
Good grief.

254
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,831
That little brat…

255
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:46,425
What is it?

256
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:51,973
Over there.

257
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:53,933
What?

258
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:56,435
What was it?

259
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,520
Someone I know

260
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:02,108
was standing there just now.

261
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,276
Over there.

262
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,903
Goodness.

263
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,321
Someone you know?

264
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,073
Unbelievable.

265
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:12,285
This is not some market in the capital
where people can bump into each other!

266
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,120
Wait.

267
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,540
He was there just a moment ago.

268
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:18,874
Step away.

269
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,626
Stop playing games

270
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,752
and go back inside.

271
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:24,839
You will be flogged
if the magistrate sees you.

272
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:25,798
Do you understand?

273
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:32,513
Get back inside.

274
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,278
What is this?

275
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,613
It is your meal.

276
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,907
That was not the point of my question.

277
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:55,328
Did I not give you money
for food yesterday?

278
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,788
Do not put on such airs
for some petty change.

279
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:03,210
You bastard!

280
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,005
Do you know who I am?

281
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,800
You can have this lousy food.

282
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:16,474
I will head straight to the magistracy
and inform the magistrate of this!

283
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,478
Acting like a nobleman

284
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:22,730
when you are but a traitor, are you?

285
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:25,561
I knew it. It really was you.

286
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,651
I was worried that I might not
get to kill you before leaving,

287
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,362
but the heavens are on my side.

288
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,077
Your knife is rather small.

289
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:45,414
You should have brought a longer sword.

290
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,501
This will be more than enough

291
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:52,463
to kill a mangy hyena.

292
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:55,007
If you kill me,

293
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:58,260
you will die as well
for murdering an exiled criminal.

294
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:01,764
Killing a murderous runaway
is an exception.

295
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:07,394
When I go to the Underworld
and meet that wench, Hongjang,

296
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:08,854
I shall have to ask her this.

297
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:14,109
"How did you end up taking a lover
as lowly as Chu Dal-ha?"

298
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,942
You will not be meeting Hongjang
in the Underworld

299
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:59,196
since you will fall straight
into the burning pits of hell.

300
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:27,057
Lord Kim.

301
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:28,976
What brings you here?

302
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:37,818
Did you come knowing that
today is my last day in the palace

303
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:39,778
serving as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

304
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:45,409
Yoo Hyun-bo died.

305
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:51,165
He seems to have run away
after murdering his exile overseer

306
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,334
and met his end at the hand of a bandit.

307
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,634
Are you all right?

308
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:07,514
Yoo Hyun-bo

309
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:11,060
persecuted and harmed Hongjang,

310
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:14,063
but he was her only kin.

311
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:20,361
I thought I would be in agony
for the rest of my life,

312
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,489
unable to decide
whether to forgive him or not.

313
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,787
I did not expect it to end like this.

314
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:35,167
When are you leaving?

315
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,095
I shall bid my farewell
to His Majesty tomorrow

316
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,805
and leave the day after.

317
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:52,226
I wish you

318
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,478
a safe journey.

319
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:58,899
Thank you.

320
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:00,192
Please do not worry.

321
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,085
Your Royal Highness.

322
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:21,505
I wanted to see you for the last time
before I left the palace.

323
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:29,346
Master.

324
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,894
I shall remember all your teachings
until we meet again.

325
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:43,735
I shall also look forward to

326
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,655
our reunion.

327
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:56,582
Please give my regards

328
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,959
to my sister in Beijing.

329
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,922
Yes, Your Royal Highness. I shall.

330
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,800
Please stay strong and healthy

331
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,428
until the day we meet again.

332
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:12,306
I will, Master.

333
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:51,970
I am back.

334
00:28:52,054 --> 00:28:55,057
Look who we have here, my lady.

335
00:28:58,101 --> 00:28:59,102
My lady.

336
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:05,234
How did you manage to return?

337
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:09,863
His Majesty granted me a pardon

338
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:11,907
so that I could escort you to Beijing.

339
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,911
But something feels so off about you.

340
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,704
You do not have the look

341
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,624
of a haggard criminal
who suffered a punishment.

342
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:21,792
Am I wrong?

343
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,252
I must agree.

344
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:26,129
You look as bright as the moon.

345
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:29,258
Dal-ha, shining like the moonlight.

346
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:41,812
<i>Yoo Hyun-bo died.</i>

347
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:45,065
He seems to have run away
after murdering his exile overseer

348
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:47,234
and met his end at the hand of a bandit.

349
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,697
How are you feeling?

350
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,577
Are you all right?

351
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:01,290
Do not worry about me, my lady.

352
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,208
I feel fine and at ease.

353
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:08,130
That is good enough for me.

354
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,733
My lady, you should come out for a moment.

355
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:30,068
Why are you acting so fussy?

356
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:51,965
Captain Joo.

357
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:54,509
What brings you here?

358
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:56,094
His Majesty summons you.

359
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,978
I was getting ready to go to the palace.

360
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:07,189
Please allow me a moment.

361
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:09,191
I shall prepare myself and come back.

362
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:10,984
Wait.

363
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,910
What is this?

364
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,371
His Majesty has bestowed upon you
a set of attire.

365
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:24,456
Get changed and come outside.

366
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:25,540
I will be waiting.

367
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:42,015
Look at this, my lady.

368
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:46,561
What is the matter?

369
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,605
Do you not like it?

370
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:52,442
That is not it.

371
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,611
I like it.

372
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:57,948
I wish

373
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,034
His Majesty would not send you away.

374
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,329
Jageunnyeon.

375
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,331
I know it cannot happen.

376
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:09,710
I am only saying how I feel.

377
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,841
Your Majesty.

378
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,007
You did not summon me to Yeongchwijeong,

379
00:33:39,758 --> 00:33:42,844
so I was afraid
I would have to leave without seeing you.

380
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,555
I did not summon you

381
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:49,017
as I was afraid my resolve
would waver upon seeing you.

382
00:33:53,897 --> 00:33:55,816
How come you summoned me today?

383
00:33:58,568 --> 00:33:59,778
I summoned you…

384
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,700
because I wished to spend the day
wholly with you.

385
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,832
A whole day for us
to be an ordinary man and woman.

386
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:22,092
Will you join me?

387
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,152
Do you know how to skip stones?

388
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:39,418
The best stone for this game

389
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:43,172
is a flat stone like this one.

390
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,508
Here I go.

391
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:54,683
Give it a try.

392
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,744
You sure have a talent
for all games with stones.

393
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:55,911
Your Majesty.

394
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:57,621
I am fine.

395
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:01,208
Here.

396
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:17,641
Are you all right?

397
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:20,769
I am.

398
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:27,443
Let me.

399
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,474
What thought has you smiling thusly?

400
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:03,312
I was reminded of a past event.

401
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:05,606
Years ago,

402
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,192
when you ascended to the throne

403
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:11,195
and I was jailed in the State Tribunal,

404
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:12,321
I had a dream.

405
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:17,076
I dreamt that you came by

406
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,119
to see me while I was sleeping.

407
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,332
It was not a dream.

408
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:28,670
I did visit you then
without anyone knowing.

409
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:38,266
No wonder it felt so real.

410
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:40,432
There are requests I must make to you.

411
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,937
No matter how upset you get,

412
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:49,358
do not go against the Emperor rashly.

413
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,654
Seeing your eyes go ablaze

414
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:57,699
might make the Emperor fall for you.

415
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:06,333
If you do get to play <i>baduk</i>
with the Emperor,

416
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,545
remember to lose one out of three games.

417
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:13,549
Having the Emperor
insist on keeping you until he wins…

418
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:17,511
will not do at all.

419
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:25,644
Yes, Your Majesty. I will remember.

420
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:29,815
Do you have any other requests for me?

421
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,191
No matter where you are,

422
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:39,324
do not forget that you are my <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

423
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,499
I have a request to make as well.

424
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,840
Even if days go by without <i>mongwoo</i>,

425
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,302
do not be upset or harass Captain Joo.

426
00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:02,055
Do not shed tears at the sight of <i>mongwoo</i>

427
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,642
or stay all alone in Yeongchwijeong.

428
00:40:07,436 --> 00:40:08,312
One more thing.

429
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:12,024
Do not leave the queen's quarters
vacant for too long.

430
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:14,902
The court will be concerned…

431
00:40:36,006 --> 00:40:36,924
What else?

432
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,552
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

433
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:47,726
Your Majesty.

434
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,397
Why do you not ask

435
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:55,442
for my name?

436
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:03,367
You said it is the rule of your <i>baduk</i> bet.

437
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:07,621
You only tell your name
to the opponent who beats you.

438
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,958
I have not beaten you yet,

439
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:14,169
so how could I ask for your name?

440
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,636
I promise

441
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:25,806
to return safely

442
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:29,226
and give you a chance to win against me.

443
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:34,439
Here is my promise.

444
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:39,069
I will beat you when that day comes

445
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:42,698
and have you say your name.

446
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,392
I will not come to Yeongchwijeong
until Mong-woo returns.

447
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:17,978
Shut the gate to the place
until I command otherwise.

448
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,224
<i>Are you doing well, Mong-woo?</i>

449
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:59,478
<i>It has already been nine months
since you left for the Qing.</i>

450
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:02,147
<i>There have been
many events, small and big,</i>

451
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,774
<i>in and out of the palace
while you were gone.</i>

452
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,946
His Majesty has ordered us
to find a way to right the wrongs

453
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,115
that are harming our people.

454
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,868
What do you think that means?

455
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:16,495
He is referring to the wrongs

456
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:19,080
regarding the tribute offering
and the military service.

457
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,375
Do you assume

458
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:25,295
the noblemen will also have to pay taxes
to be exempt from military service?

459
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:26,963
His Majesty said it was unfair

460
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:30,634
for the commoners to suffer alone
while the noblemen made no sacrifices.

461
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:37,057
The court and the scholars
will be against this.

462
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:41,269
Even the scholars' resistance
will not work on His Majesty.

463
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:44,773
<i>After the Chief State Councilor
and Right State Councilor</i>

464
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:46,483
<i>requested to be dismissed
and left the capital,</i>

465
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,485
<i>His Majesty appointed
the Left State Councilor</i>

466
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:49,945
<i>as the Chief State Councilor,</i>

467
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:51,655
<i>the Inspector General
as the Minister of Personnel,</i>

468
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,658
<i>and the Chief Royal Secretary
as the Minister of Rites.</i>

469
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:57,285
The palace and the court
must right their wrongs

470
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:59,120
for the people to follow.

471
00:45:59,204 --> 00:46:02,415
Therefore, I will right the wrongs
of the royal family as well.

472
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,210
Expose all the crimes

473
00:46:05,293 --> 00:46:07,754
of members of the royal family
and their relatives

474
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:10,840
who went against the national law
and monopolized the salt manufacture

475
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:14,553
or stole lands that were cultivated
through people's hard work and sacrifice.

476
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:17,847
And see to it
that they are severely punished.

477
00:46:20,183 --> 00:46:23,436
<i>My brother requested to be dismissed,
but His Majesty disapproved.</i>

478
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,690
<i>He was offered the position
of the governor of Gyeonggi Province</i>

479
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:28,400
<i>which he surprisingly accepted.</i>

480
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,987
<i>The days he used to be called
one of the Three Hwans</i>

481
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:34,489
<i>are long behind him.</i>

482
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:38,743
<i>His Majesty is reforming the court
with a strong initiative.</i>

483
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:40,203
<i>But what questions me the most</i>

484
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:43,832
<i>is that he lets Jung Je-pyo,
the Supreme General of the Privy Council,</i>

485
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,292
<i>abuse his powers and seek more</i>

486
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:47,836
<i>with the Qing as his trusted patron.</i>

487
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:54,634
The Third Minister of War is here,
my lord.

488
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:56,678
Welcome, Myung-ha.

489
00:47:06,605 --> 00:47:08,982
Were you writing a letter
to send to Beijing again?

490
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:13,111
Why do you continue to send one
when you have not received any replies?

491
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:17,115
Must there be a reason
for a friend to send a letter to another?

492
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:21,911
After I heard the news
of the Princess's return

493
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:24,039
after the sudden death of Prince Rui,

494
00:47:24,122 --> 00:47:27,250
I have been hoping Mong-woo
would accompany her.

495
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:30,128
But you heard the rumor too, did you not?

496
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:33,506
They say Kang Mong-woo
may become the Emperor's <i>gidaejo</i>.

497
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,759
GIDAEJO: A GOVERNMENT POST
FOR THE EMPEROR'S BADUK COMPANION

498
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:37,844
I cannot sit back and watch that happen.

499
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:40,972
What could you possibly do

500
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:43,058
when even His Majesty has his hands tied?

501
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,352
That also upsets me.

502
00:47:45,435 --> 00:47:48,855
He locked up Yeongchwijeong
and forbade us from mentioning Mong-woo.

503
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,611
He does not seem like the man
who favored him more than anyone else.

504
00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:40,699
Have you been well, Your Royal Highness?

505
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:43,576
How did you know I was here?

506
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,163
I went to the temporary palace
to uphold a royal command to greet you,

507
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,624
and your maids directed me here.

508
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:53,586
Did the King order you to find out

509
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:55,922
whether I am dead or alive?

510
00:48:57,173 --> 00:48:59,175
Of course not, Your Royal Highness.

511
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:03,138
His Majesty is constantly concerned
about your well-being--

512
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:06,057
Tell him that I am well.

513
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:10,145
Your Royal Highness.

514
00:49:10,937 --> 00:49:12,439
Forgive me,

515
00:49:12,522 --> 00:49:15,275
but His Majesty charged me
to ask you a question.

516
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:18,528
It has been months
since you went away for a retreat,

517
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,405
so when might you be returning to the--

518
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:22,115
Why are you asking me that?

519
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:24,492
Tell the King to come by himself…

520
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:29,914
to have me consider
the matter of my return.

521
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,641
Your Majesty,
I come bearing an urgent matter.

522
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,935
I was on my way
to the Directorate of Training

523
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:52,437
and the Royal Commandery Division.

524
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,480
What is the matter?

525
00:49:57,317 --> 00:49:58,359
Your Majesty.

526
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:03,281
The Qing's envoy has reached
the Mohwa Guesthouse.

527
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:08,495
I was wondering if I could go welcome
the envoy and his party.

528
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:09,621
Your Majesty.

529
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:12,415
Two officials dispatched to Uiju
have received

530
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:15,251
and accompanied the envoy
ever since his arrival there.

531
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:18,421
There is no need
for the Supreme General to join them.

532
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:21,132
Your Majesty.

533
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,842
I have known

534
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:27,680
the Qing's current envoy for a long time,
and I am on good terms with him.

535
00:50:28,348 --> 00:50:30,433
I only seek to prevent
any discomfort to you

536
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:33,186
before your departure
from the palace tomorrow,

537
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:35,438
so please give me your approval.

538
00:50:36,856 --> 00:50:37,899
You have my approval.

539
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:40,485
As Princess Jangryeong
will need to be escorted,

540
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:42,570
take Third Minister of War
Kim Myung-ha with you.

541
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:44,531
I shall, Your Majesty.

542
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:56,209
Your Majesty.

543
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:59,254
It is clear that Jung Je-pyo
volunteered to go to the Mohwa Guesthouse

544
00:50:59,337 --> 00:51:02,423
to satisfy his selfish needs
by colluding with the Qing's envoy

545
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:05,802
and to inform the matters
of the Joseon court to the Qing.

546
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:09,305
As his reliable patron,
Prince Rui, is now long gone,

547
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,099
he seeks to contribute to their court

548
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:15,520
and prove to the Emperor
his competence as a spy.

549
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:21,192
Your concerns are duly noted.

550
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:26,072
I have a plan in mind,

551
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:29,117
so do not worry.

552
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:33,872
Make way!

553
00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:39,168
Even a snail is faster than you lot.

554
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:40,712
Go faster!

555
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,595
Hey, what do you think you are doing?

556
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,062
I will leave you behind
if you do not come to your senses!

557
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:01,065
Let us go. Hurry.

558
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:10,950
Is Se-dong here?

559
00:52:11,826 --> 00:52:12,785
Goodness.

560
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,829
Welcome, my lord.

561
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:16,372
Oh my.

562
00:52:17,123 --> 00:52:18,625
I hope you have been well.

563
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,668
I am here to see the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.
Where is she?

564
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:23,212
Sorry? What do you mean?

565
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:24,964
I know she is back.

566
00:52:25,048 --> 00:52:26,215
Do not play dumb.

567
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,637
We are not playing dumb--

568
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,306
Must I search the place
for you to tell me the truth?

569
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:37,143
Lord Kim.

570
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:49,697
Lord Kim.

571
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,450
It has been a while.

572
00:53:04,629 --> 00:53:07,090
How come you returned without a word?

573
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:09,425
Has your father not returned with you?

574
00:53:10,677 --> 00:53:12,720
He is still in Beijing.

575
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:15,848
Master Chu said he would stay by his side,

576
00:53:16,432 --> 00:53:18,518
so only I accompanied
Bun-yeong back to Joseon.

577
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:23,481
So you do not plan on
informing His Majesty of your return.

578
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:29,112
Nothing good will come of
letting him know.

579
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:32,907
What will you do now?

580
00:53:34,158 --> 00:53:35,785
After I see Her Highness and Bun-yeong

581
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:37,912
safely return to their respective posts,

582
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,123
I will leave again.

583
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,417
Until then,

584
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,461
please do not tell anyone.

585
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,502
My greetings to you, Your Majesty.

586
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:28,671
My name is Bun-yeong.

587
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,301
It must have been very difficult for you.

588
00:54:35,595 --> 00:54:38,848
Your detailed reports
on the Qing royal family

589
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,850
benefited me greatly.

590
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:44,520
I did not consider my task
to be a difficult one.

591
00:54:45,188 --> 00:54:48,608
Ever since you executed your kin,
the Principal Director,

592
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,402
Prince Rui began to fear you.

593
00:54:51,944 --> 00:54:55,573
"There is nothing stronger than a monarch
who has won the people's hearts."

594
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:56,949
He spoke thusly

595
00:54:57,033 --> 00:55:00,453
and recognized Joseon as a nation
the Qing could no longer meddle with.

596
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,667
Indeed.

597
00:55:09,796 --> 00:55:11,672
I shall reward you.

598
00:55:11,756 --> 00:55:14,175
You may request anything you would like.

599
00:55:18,471 --> 00:55:22,975
Though I have committed a grave crime
of taking Her Highness's place,

600
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:24,894
you have forgiven my crime

601
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:26,395
and spared no effort

602
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:29,649
to have me return safely
after Prince Rui's sudden demise.

603
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,444
You have already shown me
great generosity, Your Majesty.

604
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:36,364
I do not wish for more.

605
00:55:37,698 --> 00:55:39,075
I am proud of you.

606
00:55:40,785 --> 00:55:42,995
I will never forget your contribution.

607
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:52,213
Please give my thanks to the Emperor

608
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:56,008
for the safe repatriation
of Princess Jangryeong.

609
00:55:59,387 --> 00:56:02,265
He asks you to convey his gratitude
to the Emperor.

610
00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:07,228
Now that you have your princess back,

611
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:09,063
it is your turn to return the favor.

612
00:56:09,147 --> 00:56:13,234
When will you send back the criminal
who committed a crime against the Emperor?

613
00:56:16,988 --> 00:56:17,989
Wait.

614
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:21,450
Who is the envoy referring to?

615
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,662
The criminal?

616
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:26,873
He did not mention this yesterday.

617
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:31,586
He is asking when you will relinquish
the criminal to his care.

618
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:32,962
I will do so now.

619
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:36,799
Take him.

620
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,428
Arrest the criminal.

621
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,305
Your Majesty.

622
00:56:42,972 --> 00:56:44,307
No!

623
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:50,563
A criminal?

624
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,482
I, a criminal?

625
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,484
Your Majesty.

626
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,446
There must be a misunderstanding.

627
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:00,198
No.

628
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:02,491
This is a command
from the Emperor of the Great Qing.

629
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,744
Heed well, Criminal Jung Je-pyo.

630
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:06,913
"Evidence surfaced
that proves that Prince Rui

631
00:57:06,996 --> 00:57:09,207
had plotted treason
before his sudden death.

632
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,293
Prince Rui's loyal subject, Jung Je-pyo,
shall return immediately,

633
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:15,046
confess his crime before the Emperor,
and receive his punishment."

634
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,215
Take him.

635
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:21,594
Your Majesty.

636
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:23,471
Let me go!

637
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:25,389
Let me go!

638
00:57:26,432 --> 00:57:27,433
Your Majesty!

639
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:28,893
Your Majesty!

640
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:35,691
Your Majesty.

641
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,986
I am a man of Joseon

642
00:57:40,112 --> 00:57:42,490
and your loyal subject.

643
00:57:43,282 --> 00:57:47,036
The Emperor of the Qing
has no right to punish me.

644
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,788
Do you not agree?

645
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:54,418
It has been countless years
since you have not been a man of Joseon

646
00:57:55,878 --> 00:57:57,380
but a man of Qing.

647
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:07,765
You told me those very words years ago.

648
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,268
Have you forgotten already?

649
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:14,188
The horrific deaths met by Joseon's people

650
00:58:14,772 --> 00:58:18,025
and the cruel treatment
suffered by the captives

651
00:58:18,526 --> 00:58:21,612
are solely on Joseon's King and its court.

652
00:58:22,405 --> 00:58:25,700
I have been the Great Qing's loyal subject
for many years now,

653
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:28,035
but I cannot hold my head high

654
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:30,621
from the shame
of being formerly of Joseon.

655
00:58:36,794 --> 00:58:38,087
Your Majesty…

656
00:58:41,132 --> 00:58:42,216
Your Majesty.

657
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:47,597
I have committed
an unforgivable crime against you.

658
00:58:48,097 --> 00:58:49,682
Please.

659
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:54,645
I plead with you to punish me instead.

660
00:58:55,146 --> 00:58:58,274
Please do not hand me over
to these outlanders.

661
00:58:58,357 --> 00:58:59,400
Please, Your Majesty.

662
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:08,242
I sincerely wish
that I could punish you myself.

663
00:59:10,953 --> 00:59:12,455
It is unfortunate that I cannot…

664
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:19,045
as you were never my subject.

665
00:59:23,507 --> 00:59:24,467
Your Majesty.

666
00:59:31,891 --> 00:59:33,309
Your Majesty.

667
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:39,649
Your Majesty!

668
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:40,858
Take him away.

669
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:43,611
Your Majesty!

670
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:45,738
Save me!

671
00:59:46,405 --> 00:59:49,241
Save me, Your Majesty!

672
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:53,245
Your Majesty, please!

673
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,622
Your Majesty!

674
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,503
You did so well.

675
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:03,130
I am so proud of you.

676
01:00:03,631 --> 01:00:05,091
You did great.

677
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:10,638
I will not go anywhere
and live with you and Father.

678
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:12,932
Stop crying.

679
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:16,018
Why are you crying
on such a happy occasion?

680
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:17,269
My goodness.

681
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:20,147
Let us all head inside.

682
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:23,234
I am going to prepare a feast tonight.

683
01:00:23,317 --> 01:00:24,151
Gladly.

684
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,573
His Majesty charged me

685
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:34,370
to grant Bun-yeong and the two of you
a large residence and great fortune.

686
01:00:34,954 --> 01:00:37,957
If you so wish,
he will award you a government post.

687
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:39,458
My goodness.

688
01:00:40,084 --> 01:00:42,128
Such a suggestion alone
fills me with gratitude.

689
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:43,295
Unfortunately,

690
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:46,757
I have lived my entire life as a shoemaker

691
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:48,884
and I intend to live as one
for the rest of my life.

692
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:51,679
The residence, fortune,
and the government post

693
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:53,639
are of no use to me.

694
01:00:53,723 --> 01:00:56,517
On top of that,
if Lord Kang returns from Beijing,

695
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:58,477
he will require my services.

696
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:01,772
I wish to stay here in case that happens.

697
01:01:03,023 --> 01:01:04,442
Right. What about Bun-yeong?

698
01:01:04,942 --> 01:01:08,988
If you have a wish,
ask His Majesty for it.

699
01:01:09,071 --> 01:01:10,823
He will probably grant it.

700
01:01:11,907 --> 01:01:14,910
No, Father.
I will follow your will as well.

701
01:01:17,913 --> 01:01:20,499
I understand.
I will convey your message to His Majesty.

702
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:23,335
Let us go in.

703
01:01:28,632 --> 01:01:29,967
What will you do now?

704
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:36,223
I will leave the capital upon daybreak.

705
01:01:37,308 --> 01:01:39,602
May I ask where you will be heading to?

706
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,316
I am considering Master Choam's house,
a place where I have stayed before.

707
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:47,234
I have no set plans

708
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:49,653
for where I will go or what I will do

709
01:01:50,613 --> 01:01:51,947
after that.

710
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:57,286
Wherever it may be,
please send word from time to time.

711
01:01:57,953 --> 01:02:00,331
Sang-hyo is gravely worried about you.

712
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:03,918
Do not look forward to it all that much.

713
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:42,331
Hey.

714
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:45,709
What has you so deep in thought?

715
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:48,671
Let us head inside
for the morning assembly.

716
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:51,799
There will not be one,
so there is no need to.

717
01:02:52,424 --> 01:02:53,759
What do you mean by that?

718
01:02:54,927 --> 01:02:57,513
I was wondering where you two were.

719
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,351
I am going home,

720
01:03:02,434 --> 01:03:04,144
so if anyone looks for me,
tell them I left.

721
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:07,356
Are you not attending
the assembly, Great Lord?

722
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:09,692
Have you not heard the news?

723
01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:13,279
His Majesty has suddenly postponed it.

724
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:19,326
Myung-ha.

725
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:22,121
How did you know
His Majesty would postpone it?

726
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,251
Here he goes again.

727
01:03:48,063 --> 01:03:50,232
Give that to me. I will carry it.

728
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:53,319
No, it is fine. This is nothing.

729
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,280
Then let us rest there.

730
01:04:17,426 --> 01:04:19,136
There is not a single speck of cloud.

731
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:21,722
That is fortunate.

732
01:04:22,264 --> 01:04:25,392
This journey would be harder if it rained.

733
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:30,898
It is fortunate indeed.

734
01:04:34,693 --> 01:04:36,362
Stay here, my lady.

735
01:04:36,445 --> 01:04:40,074
I am going to look for a spring
and get some water.

736
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:41,700
Be safe.

737
01:04:41,784 --> 01:04:42,660
All right.

738
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:23,260
Your Majesty.

739
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:25,179
What took you so long?

740
01:06:25,262 --> 01:06:27,473
I have been waiting for you for hours.

741
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:31,560
Did you know

742
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,897
I would come by this place?

743
01:06:52,748 --> 01:06:55,084
There is nothing I do not know about you.

744
01:07:00,047 --> 01:07:01,882
Myung-ha told me

745
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:04,635
that you would pass by this place.

746
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:12,810
Were you truly planning to leave
without seeing me?

747
01:07:19,858 --> 01:07:20,943
Do not tell me…

748
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,113
you have found another lover.

749
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:30,953
I have no room for another.

750
01:07:34,665 --> 01:07:35,833
How is it

751
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,085
that you are still alone, Your Majesty?

752
01:07:38,585 --> 01:07:41,463
What do you mean? I was never alone.

753
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,717
I always had you…

754
01:07:47,553 --> 01:07:49,346
in my heart, Mong-woo.

755
01:07:54,643 --> 01:07:55,644
To tell the truth,

756
01:07:57,437 --> 01:07:58,814
I thought a <i>mongwoo</i>

757
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:03,694
just might grant me a chance to see you.

758
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:07,614
So you were planning to wait
until there was rain?

759
01:08:07,698 --> 01:08:09,575
And here I was, dying to see you.

760
01:08:12,494 --> 01:08:14,454
I guess you did not miss me as much.

761
01:08:21,962 --> 01:08:23,380
Whether <i>mongwoo</i>,

762
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:25,382
snow,

763
01:08:27,134 --> 01:08:30,846
sprinkle, or leaves fall from the sky,
it does not matter anymore.

764
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:36,226
I will no longer wait for you…

765
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:41,064
while aimlessly looking up at the sky.

766
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:19,144
Bollocks.

767
01:09:20,395 --> 01:09:22,439
What took you so long?

768
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:24,066
Lady Hee-soo

769
01:09:24,816 --> 01:09:27,653
has waited dearly for His Majesty.

770
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:33,659
I am sorry.

771
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:39,414
Please do not cry.

772
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:43,835
Why are you crying?

773
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:49,841
Because I could not be any happier!

774
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:29,799
Prepare yourself.

775
01:10:31,342 --> 01:10:32,927
I will beat you this time

776
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,179
and have you say your name.

777
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:41,394
It is Kang Hee-soo.

778
01:10:59,245 --> 01:11:00,455
Kang Hee-soo.

779
01:11:06,669 --> 01:11:10,256
So that is the name that I longed for
and sought after even in my dreams.

780
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:15,011
Hee-soo.

781
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:18,473
I will no longer

782
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:21,017
be separated from you

783
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:25,855
and spend the rest of my life with you.

784
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:57,308
THANKS FOR WATCHING <i>CAPTIVATING THE KING</i>

785
01:12:23,092 --> 01:12:25,972
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK
SON HYUN-JOO, JO SEONG-HA AND KIM HYO-JIN
