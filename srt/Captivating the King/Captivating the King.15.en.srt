CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:07,245
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:08,554
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:09,915
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,929
EPISODE 15

6
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:13,739
Do you still…

7
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,577
find me unworthy?

8
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:32,049
Is it because of the crime I committed?

9
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,598
That crime is not solely yours.

10
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,767
My brother and I had a hand in it…

11
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,275
as well as the Queen Dowager
and the Principal Director.

12
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:00,995
I refuse to accept your affection…

13
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:06,584
for claiming you as mine

14
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,963
would be reprehensible in that
I would be exploiting you

15
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,300
and hurting you yet again.

16
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,808
Do you resent me?

17
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:31,984
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,445
To speak the truth,

19
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,827
I knew that you would refuse
my final request.

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,457
Knowing your true nature…

21
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,881
might have been what led me

22
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,675
to love you.

23
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,910
This cannot be.

24
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:26,997
Did you take poison?

25
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,550
Is anyone outside?

26
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,677
Eunuch Kim!

27
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,309
Why are you standing around?

28
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,228
Bring the royal physician immediately!

29
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,239
Why in heaven's name
would you take poison?

31
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,825
Your Majesty.

32
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,246
I have received an order

33
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,790
to kill you.

34
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,735
<i>I was told…</i>

35
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,822
that you would never forgive me

36
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,161
for harming the late king

37
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:52,166
and that this was the only way
for me to survive.

38
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,627
I was also told that if you forgave me,

39
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,089
you would become

40
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,009
a depraved tyrant

41
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:08,932
who forsook the bond set by the heavens.

42
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,603
You were coerced.

43
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,188
Who was it?

44
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,565
Was it the Queen Dowager
or the Principal Director?

45
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,450
What made you change your mind?

46
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,744
Why did you take the poison

47
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,830
instead of using it to kill me?

48
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,209
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,796
My lifelong wish…

50
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:44,176
was to be loved by you.

51
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,179
However,

52
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:49,848
what I desired

53
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,852
and hoped for more

54
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,564
was to protect you…

55
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,195
until the end of my days.

56
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,826
Your Majesty.

57
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,455
Since the day you promised

58
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,333
to grant all my requests,

59
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:20,796
I have wished…

60
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,718
to say these words to you one day.

61
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,640
What are they?

62
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,102
Your Majesty.

63
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,982
I have…

64
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,029
no more…

65
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,700
requests to make.

66
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,135
Senior Court Lady Dong.

67
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,449
Your Majesty!

68
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,731
Here comes His Majesty!

69
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:15,702
Your Majesty.

70
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,705
Forgive me, but I have not received
any word of your visit.

71
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,207
May I ask what brings you…

72
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,673
Tell her I am here.

73
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:32,427
Your Royal Highness.

74
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,304
His Majesty is here.

75
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,201
Your Majesty.

76
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,370
Why is there blood on you?

77
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,129
This blood is not mine,
but Senior Court Lady Dong's.

78
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,339
Senior Court Lady Dong's?

79
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,884
What do you mean?

80
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,720
She is dead.

81
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,432
She received an order to poison me
just like my brother,

82
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,311
but she could not bring herself
to follow the order

83
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,272
and took the poison herself and died.

84
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:33,280
His Majesty cannot dare to cast me away.

85
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,157
If he dares to bring me down,

86
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,994
he will crumble before I do.

87
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,666
Mother.

88
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:47,419
I do not understand

89
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,214
how you could remain silent

90
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,925
at the news of a threat to my life.

91
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,143
I cannot fathom
what spite she may have had

92
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:06,563
to take her own life before you,

93
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,231
but poisoning?

94
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,150
As you well know,

95
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,278
the late king passed away
due to his chronic illness.

96
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,321
Mother.

97
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:18,825
Senior Court Lady Dong
confessed before she died.

98
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,786
Her words are all lies!

99
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:24,539
You must believe in your mother.

100
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:30,420
All this has come to pass
because of Chu Dal-ha's report.

101
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,673
You must behead him
and hang up his head for display

102
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:37,052
to show the world your authority
and bring an end to this case.

103
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:40,847
That is the only way
to preserve your reign.

104
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,766
I cannot and will not do so.

105
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:44,935
- Your Majesty!
- Enough!

106
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,236
Enough.

107
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,906
That is enough.

108
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,412
Do you still not see it?

109
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,916
I could not bring myself
to ask you the question

110
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,920
on the day my brother died.

111
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,964
However,

112
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,675
I already…

113
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,221
know its answer!

114
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,941
I have no idea what you are talking about.

115
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:36,153
You would have also known for long

116
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:39,614
that my uncle

117
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:44,286
is the spy who colluded with the Qing…

118
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,208
and that he poisoned my brother to death.

119
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,047
When I sought to punish him for it,

120
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,467
he turned against me
and tried to poison me as well.

121
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,310
Tell me.

122
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:12,397
Did you order him to poison my brother?

123
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,573
That is ridiculous.

124
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,338
As his crimes have been revealed,

125
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:38,089
I shall interrogate him

126
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,009
without further ado.

127
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,428
I would rather bite my tongue

128
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,598
and take my own life on this spot
than see that happen!

129
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,238
Your Majesty.

130
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,662
Reconsider what you are about to do.

131
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,667
The Principal Director
is your one and only kin

132
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:18,046
and a loyal subject
who will help you maintain your reign.

133
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,006
Do you not see

134
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,551
that you will be endangered
if you punish him?

135
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,597
Mother.

136
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,851
Let me be clear.

137
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,357
Do not act as the leader of traitors.

138
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,359
Using my authority as the king,

139
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,321
I will do everything in my power…

140
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,787
to make sure

141
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,040
not to let such an act slide.

142
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,299
Your…

143
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,053
Your Majesty.

144
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,891
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Majesty!

145
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:12,851
Your Majesty.

146
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,355
Your Majesty…

147
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,871
Your Majesty.

148
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,766
Your Majesty.

149
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,144
Your quarters are being cleaned up,

150
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,520
so let us head to Yeongchwijeong.

151
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,864
Gidaeryeong Kang should be in the palace.

152
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,741
- Go summon him.
- Yes, Captain.

153
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:34,683
Your Majesty.

154
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,199
I heard the news…

155
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,954
of Senior Court Lady Dong's death.

156
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:01,960
Back when…

157
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,800
you told me Kim Myung-ha confessed
that the Principal Director

158
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:10,593
was plotting treason,

159
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,390
I should have ordered
his immediate arrest and interrogation.

160
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,569
<i>What did you say?</i>

161
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:30,572
The Principal Director asked Myung-ha
to join him in a plot of treason?

162
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,907
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,118
Yoo Hyun-bo served
as the Principal Director's messenger

164
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:37,037
and tried to convince
the Sixth Royal Secretary.

165
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,083
He insisted on reporting them
to you himself, but I dissuaded him.

166
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,543
With Yoo Hyun-bo as the messenger,

167
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,962
the Principal Director
can simply deny his involvement,

168
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,340
which would make the Sixth Royal Secretary
a criminal who falsely accused your kin.

169
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,469
I thought it would be wiser
for me to report the matter

170
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,762
and await your orders.

171
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,806
This is better.

172
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,349
I shall exploit it

173
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,728
to trick the Principal Director
into lowering his guard.

174
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,981
Tell Myung-ha to accept his offer.

175
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,777
This is a golden opportunity
to make him reveal his own crimes.

176
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
I am responsible
for Court Lady Dong's death.

177
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:25,919
My greedy pursuit of exposing
all the crimes of the Principal Director

178
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,255
led to her death.

179
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:32,509
Your Majesty.

180
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,845
Please do not blame yourself.

181
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:38,348
They say even the wisest of the wise

182
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:42,185
cannot fully fathom another's thoughts.

183
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:43,853
I also once witnessed

184
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,274
Senior Court Lady Dong crying in despair,

185
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,445
but I failed to understand
the reasons behind her sorrow.

186
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,865
Court Lady Dong…

187
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,915
was the only one who knew of my crime.

188
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:09,587
I forced her to commit a crime for me,

189
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,549
but I never gave her my warm regards.

190
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,928
Throughout her service to me,

191
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,306
I suspected her of being the subject
of my mother and uncle

192
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,058
and begrudged her.

193
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,226
She must have believed…

194
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,315
that I would never forgive her,

195
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,109
which would have made her afraid.

196
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:38,700
She did not take her own life
because she feared punishment from you.

197
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,287
She only did so

198
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,998
as she knew you would forgive her.

199
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,087
As she knew your secret,

200
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:56,926
she would have believed her death
was the only way to protect you.

201
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,230
The reasons that I cannot forgive
the Principal Director…

202
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,111
are only piling up.

203
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:20,116
Your Majesty.

204
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,328
With Senior Court Lady Dong gone,

205
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,872
you no longer have a witness.

206
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,750
Do you still intend
to carry out the interrogation?

207
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,629
The court will be against it,
saying that it now lacks merit.

208
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,840
Even Inspector General Kim Je-nam
will not be able to support me.

209
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,008
However,

210
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,761
even if I have to quash
all resistance from the court,

211
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,765
the interrogation will be held.

212
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,602
I cannot overlook
the Principal Director's crimes.

213
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,523
Are you certain…

214
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,027
that Court Lady Dong
died from this poison?

215
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,405
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,867
What about the late king?

217
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:50,790
I would have a more accurate result
if I could examine it further.

218
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,251
But based on the looks of the silver spoon

219
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,128
and the time it takes to change colors,

220
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,341
I believe his passing
was caused by the same poison.

221
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,388
You may leave.

222
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,276
Your Majesty.

223
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:23,197
Do you think the Principal Director
gave Court Lady Dong the order?

224
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:28,828
I suspect so,
but she did not confess as much.

225
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,338
What is the matter?

226
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,131
To speak the truth,

227
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,843
my men are chasing after
one of his servants who has disappeared.

228
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:47,055
And we have learned
that he was headed to the border.

229
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,642
I am concerned that his next move
after giving out an order for your death

230
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:55,146
may be an attempt to collude
with the Qing's envoy, Jung Je-pyo,

231
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,941
bearing a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

232
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,868
I did not expect…

233
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,874
that wench to be this foolish.

234
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:17,168
This is no time to mull over nothing.

235
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:19,378
What will you do now?

236
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:24,634
Thankfully, His Majesty is a tactician
who calculates all possibilities ahead.

237
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:27,512
Without Court Lady Dong,
who would have been his witness,

238
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,765
he no longer has the grounds
to summon me as a criminal.

239
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,977
As an interrogation without cause
will only face the court's resistance

240
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:38,189
and incur the suspicion of Prince Rui,

241
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:40,983
it will not take place.

242
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,987
What if His Majesty
insists on holding an interrogation?

243
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,572
And what about Kim Myung-ha?

244
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,909
If he gets cold feet and makes a report--

245
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:52,161
A report shall be fought
with another report.

246
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,542
"Kim Myung-ha
and Yoo Hyun-bo joined hands…

247
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,796
and proposed that we plot treason."

248
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:05,925
My lord.

249
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:09,387
I only raised the issue out of concern.

250
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,349
Why are you threatening me
when I am on your side?

251
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:17,937
Kim Myung-ha cannot make rash moves
because of the Crown Prince,

252
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,230
but you are different.

253
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,858
Humans are creatures of habit.

254
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:23,609
Your habits have not gone anywhere.

255
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:26,779
Remember this.

256
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:30,366
My doom will lead to your doom.

257
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,244
Do you understand?

258
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:39,292
I will remember that, my lord.

259
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,095
My lady.

260
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:54,640
The Sixth Royal Secretary is here.

261
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,159
The last words of the late king

262
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,871
were to protect the Grand Prince
and appoint him the Crown Prince.

263
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,581
His Majesty

264
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,042
is carrying out those last words.

265
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,627
Am I wrong?

266
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,840
When did you realize that?

267
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:31,928
I thought something was off

268
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,930
when the King spared my life

269
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,890
and appointed me
the Executive Assistant of Uiju.

270
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,101
I questioned his decision
as my crime deserved death.

271
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:45,691
I avoided facing the truth even after
the Grand Prince became the Crown Prince.

272
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:50,571
But the Principal Director's recent offer
made me realize it.

273
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:52,448
It was I

274
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,786
who was captivated
by the need for vengeance.

275
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,209
I am relieved

276
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:05,002
to hear you say so.

277
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,800
Do you think His Majesty

278
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,386
will interrogate the Principal Director?

279
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,015
I am afraid he will push ahead

280
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,685
despite the unfavorable circumstances.

281
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,104
Let His Majesty know

282
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,273
that I shall attend the interrogation

283
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:28,317
and report the Principal Director
for his attempt to plot treason.

284
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,528
That cannot happen.

285
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:33,864
If you take action,
His Royal Highness will be in danger,

286
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,118
and His Majesty will not approve of that.

287
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,452
There is no other way.

288
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,621
Without the interrogation,

289
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,499
the Principal Director will cover up
his crimes with aid from Prince Rui.

290
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:44,625
Were that to happen,

291
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,171
the Qing troops may invade
like they did three years ago

292
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:51,716
and attempt to take His Majesty away.

293
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,843
We cannot let that happen.

294
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,819
The horses are ready
outside the city walls, my lord.

295
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,572
But where are you going?

296
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:17,241
I will head to the Qing through Uiju

297
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,577
and seek refuge
under Prince Rui's service.

298
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,288
Hurry up. We must leave
the capital before morning.

299
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:23,372
Yes, my lord.

300
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,589
Damn it.

301
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:39,597
I am sure I heard footsteps.

302
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,279
Let us go that way.

303
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,434
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

304
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,227
Did you summon me?

305
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:27,564
Summon the judges
as I shall hold an interrogation today.

306
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,149
Your Majesty.

307
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,278
Though you ordered us not to appoint one
among the Border Defense Council members,

308
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,781
we will need a minister-level official.

309
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,242
We seek to appoint
Minister of War Min Ji-hwan as one.

310
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,952
Please give us your approval.

311
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,289
You have my approval.

312
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,708
Your Majesty.

313
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,545
Please name the criminal
to be interrogated today.

314
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,473
Principal Director…

315
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,268
Park Jong-hwan.

316
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,067
I shall follow your royal command.

317
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,042
Criminal Park Jong-hwan,
come out and follow the royal command!

318
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,389
Tell them to wait awhile
for me to get changed.

319
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,099
Yes, my lord.

320
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,199
Be honest with me.

321
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,743
Did you know that the spy
who colluded with the Qing

322
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,495
was the Principal Director?

323
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,998
Those are the exact words
I want to ask you.

324
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:13,253
From what I recall, you were closer to him
than I was three years ago.

325
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,464
I had no idea.

326
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:20,969
You know how reticent
the Principal Director can be.

327
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,848
What do you think will happen?

328
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,310
As one of the judges,
you should be able to tell how it will go.

329
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:31,354
Do you think His Majesty
will summon me to the interrogation?

330
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,691
No one knows.

331
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,736
Depending on
what the Principal Director says,

332
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,947
anyone could be summoned.

333
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,296
How dare an accused criminal
wear a court robe?

334
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,882
He must be out of his mind.

335
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:02,385
Some may even think
he is here to receive commendations.

336
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,469
Here comes His Majesty!

337
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,717
Why is the criminal
dressed in a court robe?

338
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,636
I apologize, Your Majesty.

339
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,806
Strip him of his robe.

340
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,143
Your Majesty.

341
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,854
I only came to clear my name
of the false charges.

342
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,315
I do not stand before you as a criminal.

343
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,484
As I wish to pay my respects to you,

344
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,071
please allow me
to answer your questions in this robe.

345
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,782
That is preposterous, Your Majesty.

346
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:51,453
For a loyal subject,
merely being accused of being a criminal

347
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,246
warrants one to be disrobed

348
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,290
with their hair loosened,
awaiting their punishment.

349
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,125
Please order him to take his robe off.

350
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,171
I shall take off my robe
and await your punishment

351
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,923
if I fail to answer your questions.

352
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:14,851
Principal Director.

353
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,605
You colluded with the Qing,

354
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:21,649
brought their troops into our land,

355
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,943
and ordered Senior Court Lady Dong

356
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,321
to…

357
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,835
You also ordered Senior Court Lady Dong

358
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,589
to assassinate the late king.

359
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,674
Do you confess to these crimes?

360
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:49,969
Your Majesty.

361
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,766
Your question does not make sense.

362
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,645
If I had given out such an order,

363
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,399
for whom do you think
I would have done so?

364
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,860
Then tell me, for whom
did you give her the poisoned rouge

365
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,779
and order her to assassinate me?

366
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,754
Answer my question!

367
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,304
I swear by the heavens' name

368
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,182
that I have never colluded with the Qing

369
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,811
or plotted the late king's death.

370
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,940
Moreover, I have never
even considered harming you.

371
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:49,446
Do you have evidence or witness
that I have done so?

372
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,923
Without a cause, justice falls apart.

373
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,759
I beseech you to see reason

374
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:16,264
and stop this reckless interrogation,
Your Majesty!

375
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,484
Your Majesty.

376
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,113
We have a witness
to right the cause and justice.

377
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,158
- Bring them in.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

378
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,855
What on earth are you doing?

379
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,817
I am here on a royal command
to arrest a criminal plotting treason.

380
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:13,029
Treason? That is ridiculous.

381
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,074
Who informed you of such a lie?

382
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:27,377
That little…

383
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:34,509
The Principal Director
openly boasted about his misdeeds.

384
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:39,055
Colluding with the Qing three years ago
to bring their troops into our land

385
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:44,894
and ordering Senior Court Lady Dong
to assassinate the late king

386
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,397
were all claimed as his own doing.

387
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:53,486
Furthermore, when you sought to uncover
his crimes of colluding with the Qing,

388
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,904
he said he would order

389
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,575
Court Lady Dong
to assassinate you as well.

390
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,663
I did not believe his words at first.

391
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:07,000
But upon hearing her of death,
I came to believe them.

392
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:12,088
Why did the Principal Director
share his intent to plot treason with you?

393
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,468
If you do not confess
your involvement in the treasonous plot,

394
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:22,974
I shall tell His Majesty
the lies you told three years ago

395
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:26,269
and request that you be punished
in the same way as my father.

396
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,813
You will then

397
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,984
be slaughtered like an animal
in front of everyone

398
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,236
and face a gruesome death.

399
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:40,533
That is because…

400
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,331
the Principal Director and I
plotted treason together.

401
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,500
The news of Court Lady Dong's death

402
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,836
led me to finally realize
the wrongs of my ways

403
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:55,798
- and confess my crimes to you.
- Your Majesty!

404
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:59,886
Every single word
of Yoo Hyun-bo's attestation is a lie.

405
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:04,098
I have committed no crimes!

406
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,198
Disrobe the criminal.

407
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,181
Begin the torture.

408
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,503
Do not stop…

409
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,424
until he confesses all his crimes.

410
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,283
Cease the torture.

411
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,498
Leave us for a while.

412
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,959
I must speak with the criminal alone.

413
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,689
Every single one of you shall leave.

414
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:02,360
- But Your Majesty--
- I seek to question my uncle…

415
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:07,657
on the disgraceful secrets
of the royal family, so leave.

416
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,164
Three years ago,

418
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,127
the night when my brother passed away,

419
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:09,260
I told you that I would accept my fate
before the main hall.

420
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,720
Do you remember it?

421
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,352
That was the moment

422
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,772
I set my mind for today.

423
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,865
I ascended to the throne…

424
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,956
for this very moment.

425
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:45,421
I ensured your ascent to the throne

426
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,215
by fair means and foul.

427
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:52,219
Is this truly

428
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,557
the reward for my loyalty?

429
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,186
How do you call yourself loyal

430
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:04,357
when you colluded with the enemy
and assassinated the king?

431
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,067
Uncle.

432
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,780
You are merely a base, treacherous subject

433
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:14,241
who sought to fulfill your selfish needs

434
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,995
by taking advantage of the king's power.

435
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,795
I took you for a dragon
that inherited our family's blood,

436
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,757
but you were nothing but a lowly worm.

437
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:32,927
You fool.

438
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,930
You are not a true king.

439
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:38,766
You are a fool

440
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,270
and nothing but a spy of the late king.

441
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:48,693
I have mulled over that notion

442
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:51,988
for the past three years.

443
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,492
"Am I worthy of the throne?"

444
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:00,955
"Is it right for me
to be this nation's king…

445
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,960
when I ascended to the throne…

446
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:11,424
with the help of a traitor?"

447
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,302
However, I now clearly understand…

448
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,851
that punishing you for your crimes

449
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:24,854
is my duty and right

450
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:26,731
as the king.

451
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,233
I swear to the heavens…

452
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:35,614
that I will not forgive you
for your crimes.

453
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,328
Your Majesty.

454
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:48,502
I am your one and only kin.

455
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:53,090
Abandoning me would be
severing the bond set by the heavens.

456
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:59,388
How would you endure
such disgrace and dishonor?

457
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,265
I already told you

458
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:05,978
that anyone who opposed me
should face death,

459
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,064
even my own kin.

460
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:10,107
Have you forgotten?

461
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:12,902
<i>I am the king of this nation.</i>

462
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,112
The king shall not be insulted.

463
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:20,409
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

464
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:21,327
and that includes

465
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:25,039
my kin who shares my blood.

466
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,889
What is your decision?

467
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:23,639
Look.

468
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,392
Will he be taken to the State Tribunal?

469
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,646
His Majesty commanded
that he be confined to his residence

470
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,398
until his punishment is decided.

471
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:38,612
There has never been a case

472
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:41,824
where the Queen Dowager's kin
went through such horrific interrogation

473
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:44,034
in the history of our nation.

474
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,661
It just may become

475
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,706
a more common occurrence now.

476
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,870
I owe Myung-ha a big debt.

477
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,999
The Sixth Royal Secretary
will not consider it a debt.

478
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:36,420
He now understands
the ordeal you went through

479
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:39,340
for His Royal Highness.

480
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:41,717
I am relieved he thinks that way.

481
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,198
Your Majesty.

482
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,743
What is the matter?

483
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:12,748
I do not understand these feelings.

484
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:18,212
On one hand,

485
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,547
I feel so hollow.

486
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:23,342
But at the same time,

487
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:26,720
I am afraid.

488
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,856
You have held on so far
for this day to come, Your Majesty.

489
00:47:39,817 --> 00:47:42,194
As you would have forced yourself

490
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,488
to ignore your emotional
and physical exhaustion,

491
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:48,117
it would be abnormal for you

492
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,786
not to be engulfed by such emotions.

493
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,491
Your Majesty.

494
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:14,119
Please return to your quarters.

495
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:17,372
You must rest.

496
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,333
Staying with you…

497
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:25,130
is resting to me.

498
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,740
"Chu Dal-ha has committed a grave crime.

499
00:49:52,366 --> 00:49:54,535
But as his report on the matter of the spy

500
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,912
has contributed greatly
to the exposure of treason,

501
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,539
his sentence shall be reduced

502
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:01,583
to being flogged 80 times
and 3 years of hard labor."

503
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:04,461
I shall sentence him accordingly.

504
00:50:04,962 --> 00:50:06,630
"Yoo Hyun-bo's crimes are serious

505
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,716
as he plotted treason with Park Jong-hwan.

506
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,260
But as his attestation

507
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:13,804
has averted the treason from taking place,

508
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:17,558
he shall be exiled
far away from the capital."

509
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:19,268
I shall sentence him accordingly.

510
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,436
Your Majesty.

511
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:25,274
What is the punishment for Park Jong-hwan?

512
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,118
I am still deciding.

513
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:41,832
I only seek to make
the most prudent decision,

514
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,710
so await my verdict.

515
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:56,430
Wait one moment.

516
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,682
Do you have anyone to see you off?

517
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,769
How dare you presume
that no one would see me off?

518
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:13,822
Let us just go.

519
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,800
You have a long way ahead of you.
Use it to get some drinks.

520
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:36,511
Allow me a moment.

521
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,352
Time travels fast.

522
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:46,313
I will see you soon.

523
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,833
His Majesty requests you inside.

524
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:37,239
I am here to confess my crimes,
Your Majesty.

525
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:41,243
What crimes do you mean?

526
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,789
Thanks to Gidaeryeong Kang's help,

527
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:49,543
I reported Park Jong-hwan
and Yoo Hyun-bo's plots for treason

528
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:50,877
and avoided being punished.

529
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,965
But to speak the truth,
my heart was swayed by their offer,

530
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,758
and I joined hands with them briefly.

531
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:01,179
As such, please punish me as you see fit.

532
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:08,812
I have decided…

533
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:13,650
on the Principal Director's punishment.

534
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:20,282
He shall be made to drink poison.

535
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,034
Myung-ha,

536
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:25,746
you shall take the poison to him.

537
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:30,876
Witnessing the final moments
of the Principal Director…

538
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,713
is your punishment.

539
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,591
Do not be swayed ever again.

540
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:40,886
Let his end serve as a warning
not to follow in his footsteps.

541
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:48,685
Your Majesty.

542
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:51,855
I will engrave your kindness onto my bones
and carry out your command

543
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:53,815
to the best of my ability.

544
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:16,755
Your Majesty.

545
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:20,801
Convention has it that the crimes
of a royalty's kin go unpunished.

546
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:22,969
If you must punish him, exile him instead

547
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,347
and spare his life.

548
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:28,934
Mother.

549
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,187
The Principal Director…

550
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:35,649
must die.

551
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,653
That is the only way to right the wrongs

552
00:54:41,113 --> 00:54:42,280
and make the people

553
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:45,700
consider me as a true king.

554
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:49,955
Your Majesty.

555
00:54:52,541 --> 00:54:53,542
Your Majesty.

556
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,586
This is a desperate plea from your mother.

557
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:00,257
Will you still refuse it?

558
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:15,856
Escort her away.

559
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:23,029
Your Royal Highness.

560
00:55:24,281 --> 00:55:26,491
- Let us go.
- Let me go!

561
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,540
I shall…

562
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,376
leave without aid.

563
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,532
Remember this.

564
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,161
This is the reward from His Majesty

565
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,707
for the sacrifices of his loyal subject.

566
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:35,078
It is truly delectable!

567
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,090
The Principal Director

568
00:58:24,843 --> 00:58:28,514
seems to have dispatched a servant
to alert the Qing of his situation.

569
00:58:31,183 --> 00:58:34,645
The Qing's envoy may bring approval
for the appointment of the Crown Prince

570
00:58:35,437 --> 00:58:38,148
or lead the Emperor's general
along with its troops for war.

571
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:39,775
We cannot know for sure yet.

572
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:41,443
But should the Qing

573
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,906
attempt to interfere with our matters
using the Principal Director as a pretext,

574
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:50,661
I <i>will</i> fight back.

575
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:52,746
Your Majesty.

576
00:58:53,372 --> 00:58:56,417
Your words are just and brave.

577
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,418
I shall

578
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:00,546
put my faith in your will and follow it.

579
00:59:01,296 --> 00:59:03,173
I concur with the Inspector General.

580
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:07,594
And the court officials
will also support you as one.

581
00:59:09,263 --> 00:59:11,473
I feel reassured to have you both.

582
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:15,602
Minister of War.

583
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:18,814
You shall keep your eye on the borders
and report back to me.

584
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:20,107
Yes, Your Majesty.

585
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,035
The Chief Royal Secretary is here,
Your Majesty.

586
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,288
Your Majesty.

587
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,956
Jung Je-pyo has reached Uiju

588
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,043
with a document approving
the appointment of the Crown Prince.

589
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:46,967
Send the Sixth Royal Secretary
and the Great Lord to receive him.

590
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:48,135
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:03,067
I have heard of your troubles
on your journey to bring

592
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,277
the document approving
the Crown Prince's appointment.

593
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:07,905
My travels were nothing

594
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:11,408
compared to the difficulties I suffered

595
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:13,952
from the Principal Director's death.

596
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:16,205
While staying in Uiju,

597
01:00:16,288 --> 01:00:18,749
I had to send word countless times
to Prince Rui in Beijing

598
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,876
to apprise him of the situation.

599
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:23,295
It was quite troublesome.

600
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,756
In the end,

601
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,427
Prince Rui concluded that Joseon's matters
are the purview of the King of Joseon.

602
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:35,849
I am relieved he thinks that way.

603
01:00:38,977 --> 01:00:40,104
This…

604
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,525
is my gift to you.

605
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:03,502
<i>My greetings to Prince Rui.</i>

606
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:05,587
<i>The King of Joseon</i>

607
01:01:06,088 --> 01:01:09,424
<i>has become aware of
my communication with the Great Qing</i>

608
01:01:10,008 --> 01:01:11,426
<i>and is attempting to punish me.</i>

609
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:15,514
<i>This is clearly an attempt to drive out
the faction close to the Qing</i>

610
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:17,599
<i>and cut off the Qing's influence.</i>

611
01:01:17,683 --> 01:01:19,518
<i>I believe it would be prudent</i>

612
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:22,396
<i>to summon the King to the Qing
to warn him of his actions.</i>

613
01:01:23,272 --> 01:01:25,732
<i>With the Crown Prince
who can inherit the throne,</i>

614
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:29,153
<i>you would not have to worry
about the aftermath.</i>

615
01:01:33,073 --> 01:01:35,742
Is my gift to your liking?

616
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:38,996
Yes, it is.

617
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:51,091
What do you mean
Jung Je-pyo wishes to return to Joseon?

618
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,093
It is as it sounds, Your Majesty.

619
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,596
Along with the Emperor's letter,

620
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,850
Prince Rui's letter
also contains such content.

621
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,855
"I shall send the loyal subject of Qing,
Jung Je-pyo, back to Joseon.

622
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,857
Appoint him an official of your court

623
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,817
and show him your benevolence."

624
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:16,033
So they intend to dispatch a spy openly
and not in secret.

625
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:22,998
I am almost grateful.
I shall accept the offer.

626
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:25,834
The court shall discuss
a position to give him.

627
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:27,044
Yes, Your Majesty.

628
01:02:28,253 --> 01:02:29,379
We shall do that.

629
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:31,965
Your Majesty.

630
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,887
I apologize, but Prince Rui's letter
contains another element of surprise.

631
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:40,807
What is it?

632
01:02:47,356 --> 01:02:48,523
The Emperor…

633
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:52,569
wishes to play <i>baduk</i> with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

634
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:15,133
Your Majesty.

635
01:03:22,057 --> 01:03:23,058
Right.

636
01:03:24,643 --> 01:03:26,645
My mind trailed off.

637
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,116
The Qing's envoy

638
01:03:39,908 --> 01:03:41,702
must have caused you distress.

639
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,913
It is nothing new.

640
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:48,917
Are they perhaps making
unreasonable demands

641
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:50,377
over the Principal Director's death?

642
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,545
Do not worry.

643
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:53,964
I do not intend
to give them what they want.

644
01:04:18,613 --> 01:04:19,573
My lord.

645
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,410
It has been a while.

646
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:26,705
I was waiting for you
upon hearing the maddening news.

647
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:30,375
What news?

648
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:32,544
Have you not heard yet?

649
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:35,088
I hear Prince Rui's letter

650
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:37,382
contains a request
to have you sent to Beijing.

651
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:56,360
I told you I would not drink
even a single drop of water.

652
01:04:57,903 --> 01:05:00,739
Do you take my orders as a joke?

653
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:04,368
Your Royal Highness.

654
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:06,203
You must drink.

655
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:08,580
At this rate, you will fall ill.

656
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:11,666
That is exactly my aim.

657
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:13,877
I must die

658
01:05:15,587 --> 01:05:21,134
to make the King bitterly regret
not coming to visit me even once.

659
01:05:22,677 --> 01:05:25,639
He seems to be busy
receiving the Qing's envoy.

660
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,099
Please do not be upset.

661
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:31,019
A visit from the Qing's envoy
is nothing out of the ordinary.

662
01:05:34,106 --> 01:05:36,608
Word has it that Prince Rui of the Qing

663
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,319
ordered the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
to be sent to Beijing.

664
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:41,321
Why would it matter to me

665
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,448
that a lowly <i>gidaeryeong</i>
is being summoned?

666
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:51,289
How is it that

667
01:05:52,624 --> 01:05:56,128
he cannot spare a moment to visit me
because of such a trifling matter

668
01:05:57,212 --> 01:05:59,589
when I am at death's door
from hunger and thirst?

669
01:06:16,231 --> 01:06:17,274
What an…

670
01:06:20,026 --> 01:06:22,195
undutiful son I have birthed.

671
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:31,121
Her Royal Highness
has not eaten or drunk for days.

672
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:32,247
At this rate,

673
01:06:33,415 --> 01:06:35,125
something may truly happen to her.

674
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,293
I understand.

675
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:39,045
I shall prepare herbal medicine for her.

676
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:51,349
You wench!

677
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:53,602
Watch where you are going!

678
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,313
I apologize, my lady.

679
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:58,523
You do not use your sight as you should,

680
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:00,650
but you are eager
to put your tongue to use.

681
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:11,953
- What is this?
- That is mine!

682
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:20,837
Whose residence did you steal this from?

683
01:07:21,546 --> 01:07:22,964
I did not steal it.

684
01:07:23,882 --> 01:07:25,258
I received it.

685
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:26,676
This is highly valuable.

686
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:30,347
Who would ever give it to you,
and for what reason?

687
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,268
It was given to me…

688
01:07:36,645 --> 01:07:39,189
by the late Senior Court Lady Dong.

689
01:07:42,484 --> 01:07:43,568
Court Lady Dong?

690
01:07:52,118 --> 01:07:54,037
What did she ask you to do in return?

691
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:58,250
What are you waiting for?

692
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:01,753
Hurry and tell Her Royal Highness
what you have seen and heard.

693
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:04,548
Why are you causing this ruckus?

694
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:06,883
The matter

695
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:09,010
pertains to the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

696
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,139
What about him?

697
01:08:16,184 --> 01:08:17,978
When His Majesty left the palace,

698
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:20,313
he was with another woman.

699
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,691
And this girl saw that woman.

700
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:23,692
However,

701
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:25,402
that woman

702
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,363
was the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

703
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:36,997
Have you seen it yourself?

704
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:41,793
I will take your life
if you are deceiving me.

705
01:08:42,961 --> 01:08:46,006
How would I dare
speak falsehood before you?

706
01:08:47,382 --> 01:08:49,718
I have seen with my two eyes

707
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,805
that the <i>gidaeryeong </i>is a woman.

708
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,571
Jageunnyeon.

709
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:14,409
What do you think of traveling to Beijing?

710
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:18,622
Why are you asking me that
out of the blue?

711
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:20,665
It is where my father is,

712
01:09:21,207 --> 01:09:22,334
as is Bun-yeong.

713
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:26,588
They say the place has a market
for all rare items and records.

714
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:30,634
We could take it as an opportunity
to see the world and travel.

715
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:32,761
I would go if you would.

716
01:09:33,345 --> 01:09:35,972
But do not even dream about it, my lady.

717
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:38,642
His Majesty would never approve of it.

718
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,166
Gidaeryeong Kang,
Her Royal Highness summons you.

719
01:10:03,249 --> 01:10:04,584
Let me escort you.

720
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:07,462
I have prior engagement
with His Royal Highness.

721
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:10,048
May I ask why I am being summoned?

722
01:10:10,715 --> 01:10:13,134
Could I not go see her later?

723
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:14,219
I am afraid not.

724
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,806
You will have to postpone
your visit to His Royal Highness.

725
01:10:20,392 --> 01:10:22,686
I understand. Lead the way.

726
01:10:32,737 --> 01:10:33,905
Master?

727
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:58,513
Why do you look so down
playing your <i>baduk </i>game?

728
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,559
Father.

729
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:06,479
I came by to see you
play against the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

730
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:07,981
Where could he have gone

731
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,400
to leave you all alone?

732
01:11:11,985 --> 01:11:13,027
It seemed like

733
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,947
Her Royal Highness had summoned him.

734
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,659
The Queen Dowager?

735
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:20,577
Yes.

736
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,872
I saw Master being escorted
by Senior Court Lady Han.

737
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:36,176
Your Royal Highness.

738
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:52,317
Human eyes can be so fickle.

739
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:56,863
You clearly look like a woman.

740
01:11:58,031 --> 01:11:59,532
How did I not see it before?

741
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:06,247
You caught my eye
when you first greeted me

742
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:07,791
at the Queen's quarters.

743
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:14,464
That must have been…

744
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:19,677
because you were destined
to be my future daughter-in-law.

745
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:26,768
Let them in.

746
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,103
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

747
01:13:03,388 --> 01:13:04,472
How do you like it?

748
01:13:06,599 --> 01:13:08,226
Does it suit your taste?

749
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,145
Very well.

750
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:15,817
There.

751
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:20,864
The sewing and embroidery maids
stayed up all night to prepare this robe.

752
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:22,156
Try it on.

753
01:13:25,743 --> 01:13:27,120
Come on now.

754
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,333
Your Royal Highness.

755
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,420
Forgive me,

756
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:39,299
but being His Majesty's <i>gidaeryeong</i>
is enough for me.

757
01:13:43,303 --> 01:13:45,221
Who gave you
the permission to take it off?

758
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:50,310
Your distasteful habit
of not listening while I am being civil

759
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:54,606
slipped my mind.

760
01:13:55,982 --> 01:13:57,108
Do not just stand about!

761
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:00,111
Strip her of this unseemly men's attire.

762
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:06,993
Let me go!

763
01:14:09,871 --> 01:14:12,248
Here comes His Majesty.

764
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,674
Your Majesty.

765
01:14:29,182 --> 01:14:30,224
Mother.

766
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,102
What is going on here?

767
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:43,655
Greetings, Your Majesty.

768
01:15:20,108 --> 01:15:22,860
CAPTIVATING THE KING

769
01:15:22,944 --> 01:15:26,489
Send the <i>gidaeryeong</i> to the Qing and issue
a decree for the selection of the queen.

770
01:15:26,572 --> 01:15:30,493
<i>They may call you their guest,
but who knows how they will treat you?</i>

771
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:32,286
I will go to the Emperor.

772
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,122
Why do you insist on taking the risk?

773
01:15:34,205 --> 01:15:36,749
<i>I would gain means
to aid you and this nation.</i>

774
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,419
<i>There is no reason for me
to hesitate or dread it.</i>

775
01:15:39,919 --> 01:15:41,587
<i>Even after three years,</i>

776
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:45,383
<i>I am no different
in that I still cannot protect you.</i>

777
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:47,510
<i>I promise</i>

778
01:15:48,094 --> 01:15:49,804
<i>to return safely</i>

779
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:52,974
<i>and give you a chance to win against me.</i>
