1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,198
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,507
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:09,868
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

4
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:34,925
That is enough.

5
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:40,306
That will not shield me

6
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:42,850
from the heavens' will to punish me.

7
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,479
Punish, Your Majesty?

8
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,231
That is unreasonable.

9
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,025
You have no idea…

10
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,991
of the tremendous
and serious crime I am hiding.

11
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,335
It is about time
that the crimes come to light…

12
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:14,048
and justice is served.

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,597
EPISODE 12

14
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:30,356
Let her know I am here.

15
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:33,984
Your Royal Highness.

16
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,945
His Majesty has arrived.

17
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:43,953
Welcome, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:55,547 --> 00:02:00,219
I came worried that you might be startled
by the thunder and lightning,

19
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:03,847
but it seems I was concerned needlessly.

20
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,310
As I am the eldest member
of the royal family,

21
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:11,814
it would be inappropriate for me

22
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,775
to cause a ruckus
over some thunder and lightning.

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,444
Mother.

24
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,615
The peach tree in the Royal Garden

25
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,742
was struck by lightning
and went up in flames.

26
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,872
I did not know
such a disaster had occurred.

27
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:33,210
Senior Court Lady Han must not have
told me to avoid startling me.

28
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:39,049
It is an ominous sign
that lightning struck the palace,

29
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,760
but on the bright side, no one was hurt.

30
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,554
Let us consider that good luck.

31
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,306
Do you truly believe it to be good luck?

32
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:54,023
My late brother handpicked that peach tree
and had it planted for me.

33
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:57,776
Why do you think
the heavens struck it with lightning?

34
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,447
I am afraid

35
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:04,908
that my ascension to the throne

36
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,245
might have been
against the heavens' wishes.

37
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,371
Nonsense!

38
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,541
Why do you make
such a fainthearted remark?

39
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:13,834
Mother.

40
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,172
Are you not afraid?

41
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:24,053
What should I be afraid of?

42
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,016
Do you truly have nothing
that burdens your heart?

43
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:35,731
Your words are stranger
than the thunder and lightning.

44
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,568
The people will be stirred yet again
by this incident.

45
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,904
We cannot have you
be the first one to be so affected.

46
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,239
Stay resolute.

47
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,913
I only asked out of the agony in my heart.

48
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,499
Do not think much of it.

49
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,269
I apologize, Your Majesty.

50
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,575
The world thinks
that I poisoned my brother to death.

51
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:18,208
You know…

52
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:22,004
who poisoned
my brother to death, do you not?

53
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:38,770
I will…

54
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,440
order them to bring a new one.

55
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,692
There is no need.

56
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:48,822
That will be all for the night.

57
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:53,827
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,447
I should have had
that peach tree chopped down

59
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,408
and thrown it into the fire long ago.

60
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:18,245
Why is he trembling in fear
over a mere tree?

61
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,539
His Majesty regards that tree

62
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,542
as himself.

63
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,630
That is why he went
above and beyond to save it.

64
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:31,508
Do not be foolish.

65
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,762
This is because he does not have
an heir to continue his line.

66
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,724
Had he had a son and heir with the Queen,

67
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:42,102
he would not be so easily swayed
by a mere strange event.

68
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,733
It seems that it is more urgent
to find a new queen

69
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,360
than Grand Prince Munseong's spouse.

70
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,487
You have a point.

71
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:54,823
I shall see to it.

72
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,123
Even under normal circumstances,

73
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:06,251
rumors about His Majesty
spread like wildfire.

74
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,545
With such a bizarre incident,

75
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,256
word will spread wider and faster.

76
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,092
The peach tree
is the chink in His Majesty's armor.

77
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:17,596
Stand back
in the morning assembly tomorrow

78
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,432
and let the state councilors handle it.

79
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:22,225
Yes, Lord Park.

80
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,270
How is the Great Lord doing these days?

81
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,607
As Her Majesty's illness
is more serious than we thought,

82
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,068
he is seeking a way
to acquire a cure for her.

83
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,404
I hear he will not be attending
the morning assembly tomorrow.

84
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:37,449
The Queen Dowager
is quite distressed as well.

85
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,414
Let us soon discuss

86
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,541
a marriage arrangement.

87
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,337
Yes, Lord Park.

88
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,391
Please return safely, my lord.

89
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:10,982
Brother.

90
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:14,861
What did the Principal Director mean
by the marriage arrangement?

91
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,030
It seems our family
will have a queen again

92
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,199
after a century of waiting.

93
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,242
Sorry?

94
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,994
So the marriage arrangement he spoke of

95
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,956
was referring to the selection
of a new queen?

96
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,876
Do not speak of this to anyone.

97
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:33,338
Of course not.

98
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:56,695
Last night,

99
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,658
a strange event occurred, burning down
the peach tree in the Royal Garden.

100
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,493
This must be a sign…

101
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,541
to set me on the right path.

102
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,877
What do you all think?

103
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:24,556
Your Majesty.

104
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,142
May I answer your question?

105
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,228
You may.

106
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,022
Your Majesty.

107
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:36,193
Before I could carry out
your royal command to save the tree,

108
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:37,986
it was lost to lightning.

109
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,282
This is clearly the heavens punishing me

110
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:43,783
for my negligence.

111
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,369
As such, I will await your punishment.

112
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:49,956
Please punish me as you see fit.

113
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:58,048
Myung-ha.

114
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,801
You have admitted your mistake

115
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:04,137
and stood before me
to take responsibility for it.

116
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,765
I am truly impressed.

117
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,435
That is enough,
so do not wait for my punishment.

118
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,192
Your Majesty.

119
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,693
Forgive me for my words,

120
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,153
but what is the reason

121
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:22,781
for not punishing him
when his crime is so clear?

122
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,616
Goodness, Right State Councilor.

123
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,826
Do you think
the roaring thunder and lightning

124
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,996
was to dismiss
a mere sixth royal secretary?

125
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,083
I did not mean to suggest that.

126
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,460
-However--
-If you truly wish to soothe the heavens

127
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,836
by having someone seek punishment,

128
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,755
the high-ranking officials
should do so first,

129
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:40,340
and I, the king,

130
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,843
must do so as well.

131
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,308
The strange event by the heavens' hand

132
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,978
was to send its message to me,
not Kim Myung-ha.

133
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,525
Do you not agree, Principal Director?

134
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,407
You are right on all counts, Your Majesty.

135
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,661
In my humble opinion,
I believe the heavens struck lightning

136
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:14,958
to keep you vigilant
as they treasure you as a king.

137
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,009
I, Inspector General Kim Je-nam,

138
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:25,719
would like to share my thoughts.

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,679
I am listening.

140
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,350
Please use this as an opportunity
to right the wrongs of the land

141
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,103
that is sickening our nation
and harming our people.

142
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:38,690
Then, the recent disaster
will be transformed into a blessing.

143
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,071
Your words of advice…

144
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:47,782
are pleasing to hear.

145
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,117
Listen, Chief Royal Secretary.

146
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,202
Yes, Your Majesty.

147
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,079
Command me as you wish.

148
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:56,708
Each office shall investigate in detail
the wrongs within their organization

149
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,544
and make a report of their solution.

150
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,546
This applies to everyone,

151
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,216
from the overseers of offices
to those of lower posts.

152
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,384
Do you understand?

153
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,095
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,597
Heed my words, Left State Councilor.

155
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:16,603
Submit a recommendation of officials
to be named as special royal commissioners

156
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,563
who will investigate

157
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:21,900
corrupt and greedy magistrates,
including the former ones.

158
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,362
I shall carry out your command,
Your Majesty.

159
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,001
Choam.

160
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,629
Please wait.

161
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,304
Did you call me?

162
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:53,556
My greetings are belated.

163
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,725
Congratulations on becoming
the Inspector General.

164
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:58,269
I am not sure

165
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:02,107
receiving congratulations
is appropriate on a day like this,

166
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:05,235
but I am flattered by your warm welcome.

167
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,905
The recent event should not hinder me
from offering congratulations.

168
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:12,784
I wish to arrange a gathering for you
in the near future.

169
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:14,494
When would suit you best?

170
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,373
Forgive me,

171
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,125
but I do not think I can attend.

172
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,837
His Majesty has appointed me
Inspector General himself.

173
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,632
I should not fraternize with a powerhouse
without a just cause.

174
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,592
Also,

175
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:33,263
please refrain from calling me Choam.

176
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:34,472
That name

177
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,600
is only reserved for my friends.

178
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,456
Master.

179
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:04,127
Do you really think the heavens
struck lightning to crumble this nation?

180
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,883
What is your opinion,

181
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,302
Your Highness?

182
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,471
In my opinion,

183
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:18,475
I do not think
the heavens would be that heartless.

184
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:26,941
However, I am worried.

185
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:30,278
The peach tree
that my late father planted burned down.

186
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,740
I am sure His Majesty is grieving over it.

187
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:37,494
But I am uncertain
what to say to console him.

188
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,205
Your Highness.

189
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,541
Are you not afraid of His Majesty?

190
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,126
Of course, I am.

191
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,422
When I have committed a crime
against him like the last time, that is.

192
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:53,051
But at other times, not at all.

193
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,515
I heard the court maids gossiping

194
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:02,519
that His Majesty <i>will </i>harm me one day.

195
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,148
Even after hearing such words,

196
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,734
you are still not afraid of him?

197
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,779
His Majesty that I know
will never harm me.

198
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:17,408
He will protect Myung-ha as well.

199
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:27,961
Your Highness.

200
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,464
See? Did I not tell you?

201
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:40,098
It is good news
that His Highness trusts the King.

202
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,891
Hostility toward the King

203
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,727
would only put him at a greater risk.

204
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:46,688
However,

205
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,774
His Highness will come to see one day

206
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,569
what a heinous man

207
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:55,321
the King is.

208
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,949
My father

209
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,827
died before my eyes by the King's sword.

210
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,079
He slaughtered my father
in front of everyone.

211
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:04,247
Even beasts…

212
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:08,626
hold a grudge when one of its own
is slaughtered like so.

213
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:15,091
Even if the King spares my life
and forgives me a thousand times over,

214
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,010
he is still…

215
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,054
the enemy who killed my father.

216
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,917
Your Majesty, His Majesty has arrived.

217
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,715
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,719
I apologize, but Her Majesty
is making herself presentable,

219
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,512
so please give her a moment.

220
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,027
I have finished, Your Majesty.

221
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:26,204
Tell me.

222
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,581
When will Her Majesty recover?

223
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,086
We can only learn about her symptoms
by checking her pulse.

224
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,588
We shall check her pulse
every morning and evening

225
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:37,757
and bring her herbal medicine.

226
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:42,720
Great Lord.

227
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:46,683
Please mind your manners

228
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,060
before His Majesty.

229
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,897
I apologize, Your Majesty.

230
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:53,982
Do not mind it.

231
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,988
The Queen will not be able to get her rest
if I stay here too long,

232
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:02,699
so I will excuse myself now.

233
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,452
Your Majesty, please stay a little longer.

234
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,624
It has been so long
since I have seen the two of you together.

235
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,171
Would that be all right?

236
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:22,385
If it is all right with you,

237
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,637
please stay longer.

238
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,476
I will.

239
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,191
Bring some tea for His Majesty.

240
00:19:57,795 --> 00:19:59,130
Could the Queen

241
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,467
have been poisoned like my brother?

242
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,426
No, Your Majesty.

243
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,929
Her Majesty was innately weak,

244
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,848
and her chronic illness simply worsened.

245
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,226
How long does she have?

246
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,191
I am afraid to predict
the matters of her life,

247
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,987
but it seems her time is running out.

248
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:42,757
I have a matter
I wish to discuss with the Great Lord.

249
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,933
What could this be about
for you to seek privacy?

250
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,811
It may be painful for you to hear,

251
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,398
but please bear with me until the end.

252
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,110
If it is a painful matter, do not speak.
I will not listen.

253
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:03,694
Father.

254
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,185
Go ahead.

255
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,566
I am afraid

256
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,734
I will be

257
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:47,363
leaving you soon.

258
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:50,950
That is not true.

259
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,995
It is only your illness
that is making you dispirited.

260
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,206
A talented fortuneteller
from Mount Paektu swore to me

261
00:21:57,957 --> 00:22:00,918
that you were born
with an extremely rare fate

262
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:03,004
and that you will bear His Majesty's heir

263
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:05,131
and live a long life.

264
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,135
Father.

265
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:11,262
Please hold on just a little longer.

266
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:13,723
I will find a talented physician
to cure you

267
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:16,309
even if I have to empty out my fortune.

268
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,024
People may point fingers at you

269
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,818
and call you a greedy miser,

270
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:29,363
but you have always been so generous

271
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,158
and understanding toward me.

272
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:37,914
The prospect of traveling
to the cold Underworld all alone

273
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,583
makes me feel hopeless

274
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,543
and terrified.

275
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,766
But as you have always treated me
with kindness despite my foolishness,

276
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,395
I will remember the warmth of your hands

277
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,272
as I face my death.

278
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:14,992
Father.

279
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:18,329
I have one wish.

280
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:21,624
I hope you will grant it.

281
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,502
I wish to

282
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:28,297
secure Grand Prince Munseong's safety
before I die.

283
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:33,386
I understand your affection for him.

284
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,847
But securing his safety is no easy feat.

285
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,059
If he becomes the Crown Prince,

286
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,937
his safety will be ensured.

287
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,441
Please attend the assembly

288
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,361
and petition His Majesty.

289
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:27,815
Be sure to mind your manners
in front of Her Royal Highness.

290
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:28,941
I understand.

291
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,800
These are highly valuable
100-year-old wild ginseng.

292
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,887
Hoping for your long and full life,

293
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,848
I went through great efforts
to acquire it.

294
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:03,392
Thank you.

295
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:05,144
I will gladly accept it.

296
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:14,612
Bring some tea.

297
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,799
So,

298
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:37,426
how old are your nieces?

299
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,011
Your Royal Highness.

300
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:43,808
The older one is 17,
and the younger one is 16.

301
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:49,647
Both girls are well-behaved and strong

302
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,816
without any illnesses.

303
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:54,819
My family

304
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:56,946
is also blessed with many sons.

305
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,448
I understand your meaning,
Third Minister Yoo.

306
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,992
Please drink the tea before it turns cold.

307
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:03,244
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

308
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,704
Why did you bring Yoo Hyun-bo,
not Min Ji-hwan?

309
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,124
He seems greedy
and without any class or wisdom.

310
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,251
That is what makes him perfect.

311
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:56,797
To avoid people pointing fingers at me
for being a domineering kin of the King,

312
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:00,593
I humbled myself, even bearing
the nickname of the Three Hwans.

313
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,136
But I cannot do so indefinitely.

314
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:04,930
To ensure my best service to His Majesty,

315
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:08,309
I decided that I could
no longer split the power

316
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,519
among the three of us.

317
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:16,484
You have made a wise decision.

318
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,029
But would Min Ji-hwan stand back?

319
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,448
I am sure he is full of anticipation.

320
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,366
I shall explain to him with reason.

321
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:26,744
Will your words be enough?

322
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:44,512
What did you just say?

323
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,264
A spouse for Grand Prince Munseong?

324
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,726
I misheard you, did I not?

325
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,394
You heard me right.

326
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:55,022
What do you think of him
as your daughter's spouse?

327
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,148
Lord Park.

328
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:59,568
Did you not mention
that she would be the queen?

329
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:01,695
I only said that we would discuss
marriage arrangements.

330
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,781
I never mentioned
that she would become the queen.

331
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:05,908
Do not tell me…

332
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,410
you chose Yoo Hyun-bo.

333
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:10,704
That is none of your concern.

334
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:13,833
What wrong did I ever do to you?

335
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,418
Do not think of this marriage offer
as a punishment.

336
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:17,962
It is no reward either!

337
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:23,926
Then what about everything
you have received until now?

338
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,558
Think carefully and get back to me.

339
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:40,776
You brats!

340
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:43,571
What took you so long to open up?

341
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,493
Brother, why are you so upset?

342
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:51,787
I am not upset.

343
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:55,499
I came to tell you that we have guests.

344
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:59,378
What impolite people
have barged in at this late hour?

345
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,514
What brings you to my house,

346
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,182
Gidaeryeong Kang
and Sixth Royal Secretary?

347
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:15,394
I came to give the Third Minister
the <i>baduk </i>table I owed him

348
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:18,397
and have been waiting for you
to greet you before leaving.

349
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,774
Forgive me for the inhospitality,

350
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:21,859
but please leave.

351
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:24,111
I am very exhausted.

352
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,281
You must have been shaken to learn

353
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,783
that the marriage offer
was not for the next queen.

354
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:34,079
Did you tell them, Sang-hyo?

355
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,582
Absolutely not.

356
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:39,251
But is he right?

357
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:40,794
Was the offer not for the queen?

358
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:43,339
The Principal Director's offer

359
00:29:43,923 --> 00:29:46,258
would have been
the spouse of Grand Prince Munseong.

360
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,262
So the <i>baduk </i>table was an excuse.

361
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:53,432
I will speak in detail inside.

362
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,897
Accept the marriage offer

363
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:01,482
to Grand Prince Munseong.

364
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:04,985
You are asking me
to take a leap into the abyss.

365
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,070
Brother.

366
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,740
You must know what will follow
should you refuse the marriage offer.

367
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:11,867
My family will be destroyed.

368
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,244
For what reason
would the Principal Director

369
00:30:14,328 --> 00:30:16,205
bring such a disaster to our family?

370
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:17,790
He had the Great Lord

371
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:20,626
and you, Minister Min,
at his side as his two wings

372
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:22,086
when ascending His Majesty to the throne.

373
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,797
He controlled the court
and exploited his power

374
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,840
while hiding behind the nickname,
Three Hwans.

375
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,718
Then Kim Je-nam was appointed.

376
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:32,763
He would have felt the need
to seize all power himself.

377
00:30:32,846 --> 00:30:36,058
And as you would likely not acquiesce
when you hold the military power,

378
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,851
he sought to cripple you

379
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,646
by offering marital ties
to the Grand Prince.

380
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:44,191
Were a queen to emerge from our family,
our influence would grow.

381
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:47,027
So he took the initiative
to nip it in the bud.

382
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:49,405
What is it that you want to say?

383
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,824
I will have the two wings
the Principal Director abandoned

384
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:54,910
become Grand Prince Munseong's wings

385
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:56,829
and have him

386
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,290
become the Crown Prince,
His Majesty's heir.

387
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:03,919
It is up to you, Minister Min.

388
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,255
What do you say?

389
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:09,299
It is easier said than done.

390
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:13,637
Merely suggesting the idea
of appointing him the Crown Prince

391
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,472
would have one branded as a traitor.

392
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:17,599
One way or another,

393
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:20,477
your family is set out to be doomed.

394
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,772
Am I wrong?

395
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,157
I must know
how His Majesty feels about this.

396
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,039
Gidaeryeong Kang.

397
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,668
His Majesty summons you.

398
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:51,252
Follow me.

399
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,678
I have wanted to do that since long ago.

400
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:02,597
But I have yet to discuss it
with the court.

401
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:07,602
Then I shall report to you again
after coming up with a detailed plan.

402
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:09,062
Please do.

403
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,940
If you will excuse me now, Your Majesty.

404
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:26,371
Your Majesty.

405
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,039
The <i>gidaeryeong </i>is here.

406
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,353
Why are you looking at me so intently?

407
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:53,440
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

408
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,610
It is just that you seemed
quite distressed last night.

409
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,490
However, I am relieved
that you seem bright.

410
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:07,579
One's heart is truly a fickle thing.

411
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,458
To wish for life when you love them…

412
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,170
and death when you hate them.

413
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:20,884
Wishing them to live
while wishing them to die.

414
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:25,138
That paradox
is what it means to be captivated.

415
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:31,478
These are the words of the wise scholars
that the late king enjoyed reciting.

416
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:35,899
I used to think that it meant
a king should not be captivated.

417
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,610
But I finally understand its meaning.

418
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:42,489
This tree may be gone,

419
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,160
but it found a place
to put down roots in my heart.

420
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,537
And it will continue to grow there.

421
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:53,583
Thinking so put my mind at ease.

422
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:59,964
Will you leave this spot empty?

423
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:02,550
I have already given an order
to have another tree planted.

424
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,887
The peach tree that turned into ashes

425
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:11,476
will serve as a good ground
for the new tree.

426
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:19,567
So he ordered for another tree

427
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:22,403
as the burnt tree
would serve as a good ground?

428
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,324
What does this mean?

429
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,951
I believe that it means

430
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:30,453
he is looking for an heir
who will inherit his throne.

431
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:34,624
And how can you be so sure
that he has the Grand Prince in mind?

432
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,544
No one in the royal family
will satisfy His Majesty.

433
00:34:38,044 --> 00:34:39,504
Only Grand Prince Munseong will.

434
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:43,216
I have never once thought

435
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,177
that His Majesty saw him as his successor.

436
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,055
Please convey this to your brother.

437
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,140
I shall.

438
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,351
But I cannot promise you anything.

439
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:57,146
My brother is a cautious man
who meticulously assesses his moves.

440
00:34:58,147 --> 00:34:59,023
I am aware.

441
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,778
Right, that <i>baduk </i>table was great.

442
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:06,948
Let us play <i>baduk </i>with a bet sometime
without His Majesty's knowing.

443
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,157
It would be my pleasure.

444
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:11,244
I do not know when it will be,
but I shall keep it in mind.

445
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,006
I do not think
we can convince Min Ji-hwan.

446
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,049
Even I cannot believe

447
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,552
that the King wants
Grand Prince Munseong as his heir.

448
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:30,597
There is no chance
Min Ji-hwan will believe it.

449
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,015
I am sure of this.

450
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:36,060
The King intends
to give the throne to His Highness.

451
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,855
Last night,

452
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:41,941
I had the same impression
as you repeated the Grand Prince's words.

453
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,903
It seems to me

454
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:48,031
that you want to believe the King.

455
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,205
Great Lord.

456
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:45,672
How is Her Majesty doing?

457
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:46,673
Why do you ask?

458
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:50,259
Are you counting down
the days she has left?

459
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:53,513
You may find it hard to believe,

460
00:36:54,806 --> 00:36:56,557
but I am concerned as well.

461
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,227
The Principal Director

462
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:03,731
seems to have offered Yoo Hyun-bo
the chance to become the next queen's kin.

463
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,988
I suspected as much.

464
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:21,791
I seek to petition His Majesty
to appoint the Grand Prince

465
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,003
as the Crown Prince
upon Her Majesty's request.

466
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:27,505
Will you join hands with me?

467
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,884
Are you trying to drag me down with you?

468
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:34,262
This is the last resort for us.

469
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,306
We cannot let him put us down
like some useless hounds.

470
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,619
I shall accept the marriage offer

471
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:01,372
to Grand Prince Munseong.

472
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:05,001
Tell me your conditions.

473
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:07,503
I will step down from my position

474
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:09,881
and petition to be replaced.

475
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:10,798
In return,

476
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,552
appoint me as the headmaster
of the Royal Confucian Academy.

477
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,846
So you wish to protect your family

478
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,140
in return for relinquishing
the military power?

479
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:24,312
I mean to take on a position
where I will not be a threat to you.

480
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,356
I understand.

481
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:29,567
I will arrange that.

482
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:58,096
Something is off with Minister Min.

483
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,766
He is not the type
to meekly accept the offer.

484
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,476
It does not matter.

485
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:07,480
The Min Family will not be able to
gain power in court again.

486
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:10,441
In tomorrow's morning assembly,

487
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:13,027
you must petition His Majesty

488
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,654
that as the Grand Prince has matured,

489
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:17,156
he should get married
and leave the palace.

490
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:18,950
Repeat those very words.

491
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:22,036
Yes, my lord.

492
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:40,471
That is enough.

493
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,726
Go rest, Grand Prince.

494
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:49,272
Please do not mind me.

495
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:53,526
I will stay by your side
until you fall asleep.

496
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,689
Righting the wrongs of every office
will take days.

497
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:32,815
Before that,

498
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:35,359
we must have a countermeasure

499
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,236
to put the people's minds at ease.

500
00:40:40,656 --> 00:40:42,325
When such disasters struck,

501
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:45,077
we had <i>daesaryeong</i> to soothe the people.

502
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:46,746
DAESARYEONG: ROYAL COMMAND FOR AMNESTY

503
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:49,165
Freeing criminals and offering relief

504
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:52,793
will be effective
in combating the ill rumors

505
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:54,587
that are swaying the people.

506
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,256
Such temporary measures have limits.

507
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,842
Are there any other thoughts?

508
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,935
Your Majesty.

509
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:11,604
Please allow me to speak.

510
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:15,024
Go ahead.

511
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,666
The recent strange event

512
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,335
was brought upon by

513
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:37,129
my family and I.

514
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:39,966
What do you mean by that?

515
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:44,720
If the future of our nation
was ensured by your heir,

516
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:49,392
the heavens would not have
struck lightning into the palace.

517
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:51,269
The people's minds

518
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:54,355
would not have been rattled
this much either.

519
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:58,192
As an unfortunate coincidence,

520
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,736
Her Majesty has fallen ill.

521
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:06,284
Thus, it is clear that this disaster
was caused by my family and I.

522
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:07,410
Father-in-law.

523
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:12,248
Do not think that way.

524
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:13,666
I have never once

525
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:16,961
considered this to be your fault.

526
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,007
Your Majesty.

527
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:24,844
As you have consoled me
with your benevolence,

528
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:30,766
I would like to muster up the courage
and request a petition.

529
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:36,314
Your Majesty!

530
00:42:38,566 --> 00:42:40,818
I entreat you in tears!

531
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:45,823
Please appoint Grand Prince Munseong
to be the Crown Prince

532
00:42:46,824 --> 00:42:50,703
and ensure the future of this nation!

533
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:51,996
Your Majesty!

534
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:53,956
The Great Lord's petition

535
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,709
would harm the safety of this nation
and your reign.

536
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,296
His words are no different
from those of any traitor!

537
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,965
I advise you to have the Great Lord
interrogated immediately

538
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,385
and punished harshly for high treason!

539
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:20,983
Do you all concur
with the Principal Director?

540
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:29,617
I humbly advise you

541
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:32,661
to grant the Great Lord's petition.

542
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,288
Inspector General.

543
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,415
Do reconsider.

544
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,293
You must remember

545
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:41,796
that offering support to a traitor
makes you one as well.

546
00:43:41,879 --> 00:43:42,797
Inspector General.

547
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,135
For what reason should I approve of it?

548
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:51,514
Appointing the Grand Prince as your heir

549
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:53,557
offers three benefits.

550
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,977
First, with the Grand Prince
as the Crown Prince,

551
00:43:57,061 --> 00:43:58,729
this nation's future will be ensured.

552
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:02,274
Second, it would calm
the anxious minds of the people.

553
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,317
And third,

554
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:06,445
the ill rumors will subside by themselves.

555
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:09,323
There is no other measure
better than this, Your Majesty.

556
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:12,076
What you have spoken
is absolutely foolish!

557
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:15,663
Grand Prince Munseong
is the son of the late king.

558
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:18,749
Should he become the Crown Prince,

559
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,127
that would make His Majesty
an intruder to the lineage.

560
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:26,132
Then, His Majesty's sovereignty
shall seem illegitimate to the people.

561
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:29,802
This will inevitably endanger his reign

562
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:32,930
and give a pretext to the traitors!

563
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,015
That is not an issue.

564
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:44,066
You can simply adopt
the Grand Prince as your son

565
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,818
and appoint him the Crown Prince

566
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:47,987
and easily prevent any potential issues.

567
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:52,491
Do you not agree, Principal Director?

568
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,410
Your Majesty!

569
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:59,039
I have petitioned this request
with that very intent!

570
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,126
This is my final request.

571
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,921
Please adopt the Grand Prince
as Her Majesty's issue

572
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:09,175
before she passes away

573
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:11,385
so that he may perform

574
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:14,221
the memorial service for her
after her passing!

575
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:50,732
Here comes His Majesty.

576
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:11,837
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

577
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,756
I have not made myself presentable yet.

578
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:18,593
You are still weak, so stay as you are.

579
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,097
I come with a question.

580
00:46:29,938 --> 00:46:31,022
Leave us.

581
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:46,621
During today's assembly,

582
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:49,165
your father petitioned me…

583
00:46:52,294 --> 00:46:55,213
to appoint Grand Prince Munseong
as the Crown Prince.

584
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,846
Were you aware of this?

585
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:08,768
It is what I wish for.

586
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,022
For what reason?

587
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:21,323
Your Majesty.

588
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:24,242
I am a sinner to you.

589
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:26,995
And to the Great Lord,

590
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:29,164
I am an undutiful daughter.

591
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,248
Do not…

592
00:47:36,212 --> 00:47:38,131
Do not say such words.

593
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,476
It is a pity that I am only now realizing…

594
00:47:51,811 --> 00:47:53,521
what a kind person you are.

595
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:55,106
It is my fault.

596
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,109
Until now,

597
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:00,654
I have been…

598
00:48:04,157 --> 00:48:06,910
an awful husband to you, My Queen.

599
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:12,666
No, Your Majesty.

600
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:17,796
It was through no single person's fault.

601
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:22,258
I will answer your question.

602
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:24,594
Your Majesty.

603
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,639
As my last service to you before death,

604
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:31,977
I wanted to remove
a burden on your shoulders.

605
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:34,270
I also thought

606
00:48:34,896 --> 00:48:38,650
that Grand Prince Munseong's position
would become more secure this way.

607
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,031
Is this sincerely and entirely your idea?

608
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:47,242
Yes.

609
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:49,285
It is…

610
00:48:51,538 --> 00:48:52,622
my idea.

611
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:59,087
If you do not feel comfortable,

612
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,839
please do not approve of it.

613
00:49:02,465 --> 00:49:04,050
I dare ask

614
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:06,177
that you punish me for the suggestion

615
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,513
and not…

616
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:15,020
the Great Lord and Grand Prince Munseong.

617
00:49:28,658 --> 00:49:30,118
I shall go to Yeongchwijeong.

618
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,870
Summon Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

619
00:49:31,953 --> 00:49:32,954
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,805
The Great Lord petitioned today.

621
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:55,310
Did you advise the Queen on this?

622
00:49:58,605 --> 00:49:59,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

623
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:03,985
As Her Majesty was concerned
about the safety of the Grand Prince,

624
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:06,279
I told her a way.

625
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:09,282
Do you understand
the gravity of your action?

626
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,409
If the court sets its mind on it,

627
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:13,453
the Great Lord,
as well as the Grand Prince,

628
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:16,706
may be branded as traitors and face death.

629
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:19,584
I have only done what you wished for.

630
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:22,337
Watching the ashes of the peach tree,

631
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,632
you said it would serve
as a good ground for the new tree.

632
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:30,136
You now dare to read my heart?

633
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,432
I can read it like an open book.

634
00:50:36,392 --> 00:50:38,228
Please do not try to deceive me as well.

635
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:49,823
Please stop trying to sway me.

636
00:50:54,702 --> 00:50:56,079
You will end up in danger.

637
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:02,710
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

638
00:51:08,258 --> 00:51:10,927
Her Royal Highness
requests an urgent audience.

639
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,390
All right.

640
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,835
The ones who petitioned this request,

641
00:51:43,918 --> 00:51:45,962
Great Lord Oh Wook-hwan
and Minister of War Min Ji-hwan,

642
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:48,840
and the one who supported it,
Inspector General Kim Je-nam,

643
00:51:48,923 --> 00:51:50,300
must be dismissed and punished.

644
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:53,636
The Queen should also be
stripped of her position and expelled!

645
00:52:01,227 --> 00:52:02,395
Your Majesty.

646
00:52:02,478 --> 00:52:05,982
I hope you are not considering
adopting the Grand Prince as your son.

647
00:52:06,065 --> 00:52:07,275
As I have mentioned,

648
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:10,778
it is difficult for me to sire an heir.

649
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:13,072
The only closest kin I have

650
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:15,366
is the Grand Prince.

651
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,743
That is ridiculous!

652
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,204
If only you change your mind,

653
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:21,623
you can always sire an heir.

654
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:25,501
Forgive me,

655
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:30,006
but I have made up my mind.

656
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:34,344
I will…

657
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:37,555
appoint the Grand Prince
as the Crown Prince.

658
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:40,475
That can only happen

659
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,978
over my dead body.

660
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,268
Do you think His Majesty
will accept the Great Lord's request?

661
00:53:24,686 --> 00:53:25,561
Yes.

662
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:29,607
Inspector General Kim Je-nam's remarks
would have convinced him.

663
00:53:29,691 --> 00:53:31,901
It is indeed the best measure

664
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:34,279
to soothe the people's minds.

665
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:37,365
You are all speaking nonsense.

666
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:41,411
You should not concur
with something so unacceptable.

667
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:43,788
Mind your tone and manners,
Third Minister Yoo!

668
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:49,794
I was just too frustrated.

669
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,005
Please forgive me.

670
00:53:53,006 --> 00:53:56,217
Anyway, we shall follow
His Majesty's decision

671
00:53:56,884 --> 00:53:58,511
if he approves.

672
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:14,736
My lord.

673
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,487
Are you going to sit back and watch?

674
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:33,921
My lord.

675
00:54:55,777 --> 00:54:57,236
<i>Please hold onto this.</i>

676
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:59,572
I will take it back

677
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,116
the next time there is a drizzle.

678
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:04,243
All right.

679
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,498
I will keep it safe until then.

680
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,063
You brat, what insolence is this?

681
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:16,524
Withdraw your sword immediately.

682
00:56:17,024 --> 00:56:17,900
Your Majesty.

683
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:19,610
What shall I do?

684
00:56:23,364 --> 00:56:24,365
Principal Director.

685
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:30,580
Did you forget that no one can enter here
without my permission?

686
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:33,666
Your Majesty,

687
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:36,419
I have come to request a private audience.

688
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:40,840
You may leave.

689
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:51,934
Your Majesty.

690
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:55,813
Are you truly considering
approving the Great Lord's petition?

691
00:56:55,897 --> 00:56:57,148
I will approve it.

692
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,442
The Inspector General had a point

693
00:56:59,525 --> 00:57:01,360
when he said that ensuring
the nation's future

694
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:03,738
would silence the ill rumors.

695
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,865
It is a foolish thought, Your Majesty.

696
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:10,536
I have struggled on and on
to protect your reign.

697
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,664
What wisdom could he have
after years away from the capital?

698
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:15,875
You must not let him sway you.

699
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,668
I just cannot accept it.

700
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:20,797
Please come to your senses!

701
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:35,061
Are you the king of this nation, Uncle?

702
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:41,818
How dare you raise your voice at me

703
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:43,861
and lecture me
on what is acceptable or not?

704
00:57:48,366 --> 00:57:49,575
I apologize, Your Majesty.

705
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:52,411
-I was only--
-In your eyes,

706
00:57:53,788 --> 00:57:58,251
I must still look like a weeping child
holding onto my mother's skirts.

707
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:00,878
I cannot dare to think that way.

708
00:58:00,962 --> 00:58:02,338
I was only concerned

709
00:58:02,421 --> 00:58:04,882
that you were lending your ear

710
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:06,968
to the words
of the cowardly and disloyal--

711
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,094
Shut your mouth!

712
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,852
What exactly have you done for my reign?

713
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,479
Stop taking the credit
and tell me of your exploits.

714
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:25,570
The appointment of the Crown Prince

715
00:58:25,653 --> 00:58:30,157
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

716
00:58:32,535 --> 00:58:36,289
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

717
00:58:36,372 --> 00:58:37,999
and then eliminate him.

718
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:41,794
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

719
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:45,590
If you dare to disrespect me

720
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:47,758
and display insolence ever again,

721
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:53,014
you will not go unpunished
even with protection from my mother.

722
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,142
If the court opposes your decision

723
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,603
to expel the Crown Prince,

724
00:59:00,062 --> 00:59:01,772
what will you do then?

725
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,240
I am the king of this nation.

726
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,620
The king shall not be insulted.

727
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:20,166
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

728
00:59:20,249 --> 00:59:21,125
and that includes

729
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:24,962
my kin who shares my blood.

730
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:38,559
I finally understand

731
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:44,482
why my late brother hated me so much
and wanted me dead.

732
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:47,777
The power of the king

733
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:51,489
is not to be shared with anyone else.

734
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,612
<i>Your Majesty,
Grand Prince Munseong is here.</i>

735
01:01:14,363 --> 01:01:15,448
<i>Let him in.</i>

736
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,131
Take it.

737
01:01:33,466 --> 01:01:35,801
This is a token of my vow

738
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:40,347
that I will adopt you as my son
and appoint you the Crown Prince.

739
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:53,027
I promise to serve you as your son
with all my heart

740
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,739
and carry out the duties
of the Crown Prince.

741
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:21,972
I will call you Mother from now on.

742
01:02:26,227 --> 01:02:29,396
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

743
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:34,151
This is all…

744
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:37,154
thanks to you, Father.

745
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:41,534
I can finally

746
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:44,453
close my eyes in peace.

747
01:03:07,226 --> 01:03:08,269
Your Majesty.

748
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:11,480
Mother.

749
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:15,151
Your Majesty.

750
01:03:15,651 --> 01:03:16,777
Mother.

751
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:19,405
Mother.

752
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:21,907
Mother.

753
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:42,803
Your Majesty…

754
01:03:48,934 --> 01:03:49,935
Your Majesty…

755
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:10,581
Her Majesty has passed away.

756
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:17,755
His Majesty ordered you
not to enter the palace

757
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:19,298
during her funeral.

758
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,760
I understand.

759
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:03,509
The time has come.

760
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:08,764
With the King still alive,
the Grand Prince's life will be at risk.

761
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,934
Please make your decision now.

762
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:16,939
<i>The appointment of the Crown Prince</i>

763
01:05:17,022 --> 01:05:21,402
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

764
01:05:23,862 --> 01:05:27,449
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

765
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:29,243
and then eliminate him.

766
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:33,038
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

767
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:38,502
My lady.

768
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:46,010
I will do it.

769
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:49,471
I started this,

770
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,725
so I want to finish it myself.

771
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:54,727
I cannot allow that.

772
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:57,855
I must end the King's life
with my own hands.

773
01:05:57,938 --> 01:05:59,148
That is the only way…

774
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:03,527
to soothe Hongjang's resentment.

775
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,208
All right.

776
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:21,628
Do as you wish.

777
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,633
My lady.

778
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:13,097
My lady.

779
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:25,234
I was arrogant.

780
01:07:28,862 --> 01:07:31,115
I thought I lost myself three years ago…

781
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:36,954
and had nothing left
to lose or be afraid of.

782
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,168
But I still must have kept hopes…

783
01:07:46,422 --> 01:07:48,298
to live out my life as Kang Hee-soo

784
01:07:53,387 --> 01:07:55,139
and to believe in the King.

785
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:05,607
I am clueless…

786
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:09,862
as to what to do with my feelings.

787
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,829
You are breaking my heart, my lady.

788
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:49,818
I am the one who went through
the mourning for the Queen,

789
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:52,529
and yet, you look worse off than me.

790
01:08:54,823 --> 01:08:56,909
It must be due to my guilty conscience

791
01:08:58,076 --> 01:08:59,286
for my crimes against her.

792
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:03,081
The Queen relied on you.

793
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,711
She would not wish for you to be in pain.

794
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:13,800
You said if I called for you,

795
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,347
you would come running to me.

796
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:22,309
I wish…

797
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,271
to see you tonight.

798
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,442
I also wish for the same thing.

799
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:37,991
Then…

800
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:40,827
I shall wait for you there.

801
01:09:57,386 --> 01:09:59,221
Let the King enter first

802
01:09:59,972 --> 01:10:01,598
and come in a moment later.

803
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:05,227
I must

804
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:09,773
remain a nameless assassin
who snuck in to murder the King.

805
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:13,735
You must pretend to have been ignorant.

806
01:10:14,736 --> 01:10:15,821
Do you understand?

807
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,451
If you do meet Hongjang,

808
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:25,914
please give her my regards.

809
01:10:33,505 --> 01:10:34,506
I shall.

810
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:52,417
Wait outside.

811
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:53,502
Yes, Your Majesty.

812
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:26,618
I…

813
01:12:30,997 --> 01:12:33,208
must have given you a hard time.

814
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:45,429
What must I do to stop your tears?

815
01:13:28,013 --> 01:13:29,264
What is the matter?

816
01:13:40,192 --> 01:13:42,027
You are trembling. What is wrong?

817
01:13:48,408 --> 01:13:49,493
You cannot…

818
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:55,081
go inside.

819
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,176
Do you have another lover waiting inside?

820
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:13,850
Or…

821
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,525
is there an assassin hiding to kill me?

822

<i>Did something happen to His Majesty?</i>

Is His Majesty the man

<i>because you became afraid and sick of me.</i>

<i>Due to the grudges they hold,

834

to assassinate you.
