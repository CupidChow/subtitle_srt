10
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,365
You dislike me.

11
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,162
No, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,626
Do you like me then?

13
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:19,764
I do.

14
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:25,979
I…

15
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,734
like you, Mong-woo.

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,871
Do not look so startled.

17
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:43,913
I am just…

18
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,627
expressing how I feel.

19
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,521
<i>Have you heard?</i>

20
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:09,439
<i>About what?</i>

21
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,107
His Majesty…

22
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,526
What? Attracted to men?

23
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,111
Are you certain?

24
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:42,305
What has you so deep in thought?

25
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:47,852
Measures to win, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:52,982
You cannot win against me.

27
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:56,277
In my humble opinion,

28
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:00,114
the victor has not yet been decided.

29
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:05,787
Shall I take back a move?

30
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,998
Simply make a request,
and I will take one back.

31
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,420
I shall not adhere to

32
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,881
such an unreasonable order.

33
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,811
Defense alone
will not lead you to victory.

34
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:32,063
You must play on the offensive.

35
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:41,572
Like so, Your Majesty?

36
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,756
If I ask you to take back a move,
would you allow it?

37
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,260
Respectfully,

38
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,554
I cannot allow that.

39
00:04:05,972 --> 00:04:08,016
I cannot miss the golden opportunity

40
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,018
that may not ever come again.

41
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,277
You win, Mong-woo.

42
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:21,863
To speak the truth,

43
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:24,490
this is not my victory

44
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:25,783
but your loss.

45
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,287
You lost focus and were caught off guard.

46
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,558
Your Majesty, it is me, Sang-hwa.

47
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,435
You may come in.

48
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,035
That is yours.

49
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,579
Pardon?

50
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,457
A herbal medicine for me?

51
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,460
I have almost recovered, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,961
The royal physician gave me an ointment--

53
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,671
The medicine is not for your sake

54
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,006
but mine.

55
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:25,927
I can only play <i>baduk</i> with an easy heart
when you are well.

56
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:34,644
Must I feed it to you?

57
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:48,157
How does it taste?

58
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,158
Is it bitter?

59
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:52,537
It tastes fine.

60
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:04,715
<i>Since when has such a rumor
started going around?</i>

61
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,593
It started spreading after the <i>gisinje</i>.

62
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:11,305
The gossip started among the servants
who traveled with His Majesty,

63
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,226
and it now seems to have spread
among the commoners as well.

64
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,312
His Majesty included Kang Mong-woo
in his retinue for the <i>gisinje</i>,

65
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:22,150
had the royal physician tend to him
when he got injured during a sword fight,

66
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:25,153
and ordered the Royal Clinic

67
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,905
to prepare herbal medicine
for Kang Mong-woo upon returning.

68
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:31,325
With so many episodes
seemingly confirming the rumor,

69
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:34,162
it has spread like wildfire.

70
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:35,830
Kang Mong-woo.

71
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:38,583
What a mysterious man.

72
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,377
He was expelled for high treason
three years ago

73
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,839
after forging a false attestation
in service of Kim Jong-bae.

74
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,551
But now, nestled at Yeongchwijeong
as the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,

75
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:51,512
he is hogging His Majesty's attention.

76
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,181
A false attestation?

77
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,183
Kang Mong-woo did that?

78
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,018
Were you not aware?

79
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,563
I was not.

80
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,233
Is there a way to stop the rumors?

81
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:06,777
The most certain way

82
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,071
is to expel the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

83
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:12,825
That would also be the most difficult way.

84
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,703
I do not think His Majesty will approve.

85
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:18,539
I shall try to secure the support
of other court officials.

86
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:20,458
Do so.

87
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:58,079
I need to have a word with you.

88
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,336
What is going on?

89
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,590
Are you asking me
if the rumor is true or not?

90
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:11,133
I know that it cannot be true.

91
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:12,301
What I want to ask is…

92
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:21,602
The court will be filing a petition
to His Majesty shortly.

93
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:23,354
What is your plan?

94
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,065
I will not do anything.

95
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,903
Rumors only grow rampant
when one tries to silence them.

96
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,616
But it is true
that you are the King's favorite.

97
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,952
There is no truth to his favoritism.

98
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:40,580
He pretends to be fond of me,

99
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,583
intoxicated in his own joy.

100
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,835
It is a pretense?

101
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:49,213
I cannot forget the King's words to me

102
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,966
even now.

103
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,720
I am no longer an ordinary man.

104
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,055
I am the king of this nation.

105
00:08:58,556 --> 00:08:59,682
A king

106
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,893
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

107
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,480
He keeps no such thing as friends.

108
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:21,704
I was not aware

109
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,957
that he had spoken so harshly.

110
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,626
Now that you know,

111
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:30,379
please do not suspect me
simply because I am his favorite.

112
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,214
The King

113
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:33,841
is my sworn enemy.

114
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:37,720
Nothing will change that fact.

115
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,016
That may be what your mind is telling you,

116
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:44,727
but does your heart follow it?

117
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:34,235
What is this?

118
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:37,321
Do you not fear the Special Firearms Unit?

119
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,040
I would like to

120
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,877
befriend the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

121
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,838
Please arrange a meeting for us.

122
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,632
And why would I do that?

123
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,426
You two are close.

124
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:04,598
Though the rumor of Kang Mong-woo
being attracted to men is unsavory,

125
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:06,100
that matters not.

126
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:07,810
He is His Majesty's favorite, after all.

127
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,687
I would have done the same.

128
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,151
Shut your mouth

129
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,695
and move while I am being civil.

130
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:29,999
My lord.

131
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,751
Do you think the rumor is true?

132
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,591
It is a misunderstanding, Your Majesty.

133
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:41,427
I have never attempted
to harm the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

134
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,892
If you lay a finger
on Kang Mong-woo again,

135
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,270
I will behead you myself.

136
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:52,229
Do you understand?

137
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,106
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,160
Whether it is true or not
is of no importance.

139
00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:12,917
What matters is
whether it is beneficial to me or not.

140
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:37,566
Just say it.

141
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,862
What could I have to say?

142
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:44,448
The rumor is spread everywhere,

143
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,908
and you are aware of it.

144
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:48,786
Speaking about it
will only make each other upset.

145
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:51,080
At least you know.

146
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,458
The thing is,

147
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:58,212
while Jeomine was out peddling hair oil

148
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:01,590
to the First Senior Consort's family,
she heard this story about--

149
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:03,551
Do I have to know this?

150
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,888
No, my lady.

151
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,734
According to their housemaid,

152
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:23,779
when the First Senior Consort
went home last year on a retreat,

153
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:26,907
she apparently let it all out
while crying a river.

154
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,869
Her Royal Highness kept persecuting her
for failing to bear a child,

155
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,496
which ended up making her ill.

156
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,206
But the fact is,

157
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:38,377
how was she supposed to bear one
when she has never bedded His Majesty?

158
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:45,384
What with the raging rumor
about His Majesty being attracted to men,

159
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,012
the consorts' quarters
were all turned upside down.

160
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:51,849
Why so?

161
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,186
The First Senior Consort thought
she was the only one who was turned down,

162
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,479
but in truth,

163
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:01,483
all the consorts, as well as Her Majesty,

164
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:05,446
have never consummated their union
with His Majesty.

165
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:06,363
But how…

166
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:07,990
How is that possible?

167
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:10,826
To my knowledge,
that would not be so easy to pull off

168
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,661
what with all the prying eyes on them.

169
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:15,623
Apparently, spending the night
with His Majesty

170
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,792
is quite tricky in many ways.

171
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:19,710
I see.

172
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,671
There are more things
he disallows than he allows.

173
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:23,589
I see.

174
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:29,386
Women are not allowed to move
until His Majesty touches them.

175
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,180
My goodness.

176
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:35,267
They cannot fall asleep
before His Majesty does.

177
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,393
Gosh, that is hot.

178
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:40,356
He is unmoved
by women of incomparable beauty

179
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,275
as if they were
just some rocks like these.

180
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:46,111
If your tales are indeed all true,

181
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,988
then he truly is impressive.

182
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:50,199
How does he manage to hold it in like so?

183
00:14:50,282 --> 00:14:51,325
Goodness.

184
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:54,119
This is obviously a sign
that he is attracted to men, is it not?

185
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,918
I just cannot be sure
whether to believe it or not.

186
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,048
Goodness.

187
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:09,885
The most pitiable person
is the expelled First Senior Consort

188
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,512
who even held secret rituals

189
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:14,348
under Her Royal Highness's orders
to bear the King a son.

190
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,557
Poor thing.

191
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,351
Do you see the implication as well?

192
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,061
What implication?

193
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,521
About Senior Court Lady Dong.

194
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:25,067
That saucy court lady,
who is said to be adored by His Majesty,

195
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,110
also…

196
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:28,821
has not found success

197
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:31,031
- in bedding His Majesty.
- I see.

198
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,325
My gosh.

199
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:41,208
- Let us head to Yeongchwijeong.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:58,517
The Principal Director has summoned you.

201
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:15,159
Have you summoned me, Lord Park?

202
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,495
You should have been truthful with me.

203
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:20,664
Do not tell me

204
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:24,918
you expected
your deception to hold forever.

205
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:45,439
I have not taken your life

206
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,067
solely because of His Majesty.

207
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,487
I spared your life despite the risk

208
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,114
as it seemed he was very fond of you.

209
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:57,743
Forgive me, Lord Park.

210
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,163
Please spare my life.

211
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,582
But why should I?

212
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,587
It is most beneficial for me
to take your life.

213
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,241
You may leave.

214
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,037
Your Majesty.

215
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,374
I have a matter
I wish to speak to you about.

216
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,169
What is it?

217
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:51,672
Please…

218
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,717
dismiss me from my current post.

219
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,808
What is the reason?

220
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,770
Everyone now knows

221
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:09,982
that I have never received your affection.

222
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:15,279
I cannot bear to see others out of shame.

223
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,239
- Therefore--
- I disapprove!

224
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:19,825
Your Majesty.

225
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:23,453
I am afraid I cannot aid you
properly any longer.

226
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,581
Please dismiss me from your quarters.

227
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:26,498
No.

228
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:28,458
Please expel me from the palace.

229
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,835
I entreat you, Your Majesty.

230
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,171
Your entreaty is nothing but coercion!

231
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:44,016
What is it that you want?

232
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,770
I would like to become your woman.

233
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,941
Please allow me to spend a night with you.

234
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:22,930
I…

235
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,061
will not bed you…

236
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:33,732
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

237
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:38,820
Your Majesty.

238
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,365
You cannot be crueler than this.

239
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,451
How could you ask me
to endure such indignity?

240
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,328
I, too, am enduring one.

241
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,374
You must endure as well.

242
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,132
That is a royal command.

243
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:46,888
Your Royal Highness.

244
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,974
Senior Court Lady Dong seeks an audience.

245
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:52,477
Let her in.

246
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:02,779
What did you say?

247
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,782
You want me to help you
spend the night with the King?

248
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,868
Did I hear that correctly?

249
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:12,456
Yes, that is what I have said.

250
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,540
You cunning wench!

251
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,837
You must have a death wish.

252
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:21,298
I apologize,

253
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,632
but if you take my life,

254
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:28,722
you will lose all means to put an end
to His Majesty's attraction to men.

255
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,606
Are you saying that the rumor is true?

256
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,737
That also means that His Majesty

257
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,697
never bestowed you
any affection, does it not?

258
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:50,702
There are different types of affection.

259
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,871
More like the recompense for your sins.

260
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:09,846
I am glad you remember.

261
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,015
Please fulfill the promise

262
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,476
that you made me back then.

263
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:22,526
Even if you end up bearing his child,

264
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,862
you will not be appointed a consort.

265
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:30,033
I only wish for one thing.

266
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,910
It is to serve His Majesty in proximity

267
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:34,788
until I take my last breath.

268
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:38,291
That is all.

269
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:57,978
What is this?

270
00:22:58,937 --> 00:23:00,730
It is a petition from court officials

271
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,108
seeking the dismissal
of Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

272
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:07,821
For what reason?

273
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,657
As you are well aware,

274
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:14,035
we seek to eradicate
the ill rumors going around.

275
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,497
If I dismiss the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,

276
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,709
do the rumors magically disappear?

277
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,795
At least the misconception about you
will disappear, Your Majesty.

278
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,088
What misconception?

279
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:28,383
It is true that I am fond of
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

280
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:31,219
Forgive me,

281
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:35,640
but we only filed a petition
to maintain your peaceful reign

282
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:38,727
and soothe the people's uneasy hearts.

283
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,771
Please grant us your approval.

284
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,232
- Please grant us your approval.
- Please grant us your approval.

285
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:54,618
Goodness.

286
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,876
The petition regarding the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
will not be granted.

287
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,711
I apologize,

288
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:08,215
but if you do not,
they will file another petition.

289
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:10,800
When that happens,
a clause will only be added

290
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:14,596
seeking his punishment
for harming you and the court.

291
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,766
What harm did Kang Mong-woo inflict on me?

292
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,894
A controversy was sparked

293
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:24,856
by your decision to bring Kang Mong-woo
and Grand Prince Munseong to the <i>gisinje</i>.

294
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,026
Some even seem to be
eyeing the Grand Prince.

295
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,446
As they may use the rumor
as an excuse to plot treason,

296
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:33,031
I advise you to expel

297
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:36,534
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
and let this serve as a warning.

298
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:42,582
A hint of vulnerability
becomes a reason for them to get ideas.

299
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:46,336
But then again,

300
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,258
you also proposed that we plot a treason

301
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,261
when my brother fell ill.

302
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:59,599
I have always been
and still am ready to sacrifice anything

303
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:02,602
in service of you, Your Majesty.

304
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,479
As long as it benefits you,

305
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,357
I would even gladly take on
a false charge of being a traitor.

306
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,525
I beg you…

307
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,362
not to underrate my loyalty.

308
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:13,571
Kang Mong-woo…

309
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,534
will not be expelled.

310
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:20,370
Search for another way.

311
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,748
Please take this.

312
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:35,635
What is this date for?

313
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:38,972
Upon Her Royal Highness's command,

314
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:40,473
the Royal Astronomical Observatory

315
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:44,060
chose a date for you to bed
Senior Court Lady Dong.

316
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,233
If she produces your heir,

317
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,735
all rumors will dissipate

318
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:55,196
as well as the court's uneasiness.

319
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:57,824
If you accept the set date,

320
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,452
I will take responsibility

321
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,872
and withdraw the petition
regarding the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

322
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,111
How is Her Majesty?

323
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,530
Both her body and soul
seem to have weakened.

324
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,533
I shall quickly brew herbal medicine
to strengthen her condition.

325
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,452
That will take too long.

326
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,121
Is there no other way to break her fever?

327
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,791
I apologize,
but if we force her temperature down,

328
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:50,794
the chill may worsen her illness.

329
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:55,548
I see.

330
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:56,508
You may leave.

331
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:09,687
My dearest, Her Majesty…

332
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,192
must have been suffering torment.

333
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,411
Your Majesty.

334
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:28,957
Your decision has given me much joy.

335
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:33,920
Seeing you so pleased

336
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,005
gladdens my heart as well.

337
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:42,762
It is the queen's duty to manage
the affairs of the king's bedchamber.

338
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:46,307
See to it that everything
is prepared to perfection.

339
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,645
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

340
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,497
What are you looking at?

341
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,336
I was looking at the fish in the pond.

342
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,930
I do not see any.

343
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,559
I clearly saw one earlier.

344
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,103
You have keen eyes

345
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:36,483
to find fish in the pond from this bridge.

346
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,490
Your Majesty.

347
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:46,826
You must go to the hall of governance.

348
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,119
All right.

349
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,374
I shall return after the assembly,

350
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,169
so be prepared to tell me your wish.

351
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,713
Your Majesty.

352
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,173
I apologize,

353
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,341
but may I please

354
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:04,302
let you know at a later time?

355
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,432
So as to use it
when you are desperately in need?

356
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,728
All right, you may do so.

357
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,571
Gidaeryeong Kang.

358
00:29:26,324 --> 00:29:28,076
Her Majesty summons you.

359
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,182
Your Majesty.

360
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:52,767
Did you summon me?

361
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,104
You may lift your head, Gidaeryeong.

362
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,320
- Your Majesty.
- What is the matter?

363
00:30:04,988 --> 00:30:07,490
Did you think I would be angry at you?

364
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,952
I am not.

365
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:14,914
My fury is for someone else.

366
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:19,919
Senior Court Lady Dong.

367
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:24,757
As she was His Majesty's favorite,

368
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,386
she has carried out my duties
as the queen until now.

369
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:29,596
It is shameful,

370
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:32,974
but my only choice
was to sit back and watch.

371
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:35,268
She may carry out your duties,

372
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,479
but she could never match your grace.

373
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,109
I appreciate your words,
but they do not console me.

374
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,615
With the approval from Her Royal Highness,

375
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,576
she is officially spending the night
with His Majesty.

376
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,623
I cannot hold this vexation any longer.

377
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,751
However indecent,

378
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,172
I would much rather the rumor
between you and His Majesty were true.

379
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:12,347
Your Majesty.

380
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,515
Grand Prince Munseong
requests an audience.

381
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,850
What shall I do?

382
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:18,853
Let him in.

383
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,402
Welcome, Grand Prince.

384
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,460
I apologize for my belated greetings.

385
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:47,715
I have only heard the news
of your ill health today.

386
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:52,804
How do you feel, Your Majesty?

387
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:20,915
Thank you.

388
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:25,086
I feel much better seeing you.

389
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:46,315
With the approval from Her Royal Highness,

390
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,860
she is officially spending the night
with His Majesty.

391
00:33:16,846 --> 00:33:19,307
What happens if Senior Court Lady Dong
bears his child?

392
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:22,435
If the King begets an heir,

393
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:25,146
all our plans will go into shambles.

394
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:31,486
It will not matter
even if she bears him a son.

395
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:35,073
That will only make him a tyrant
who had a son with the late king's woman.

396
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:38,367
With such evidence
of his depravity and indecency,

397
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,662
our case for dethronement
will only be strengthened.

398
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,586
I am glad.

399
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:53,299
I was concerned that the news
might bring you distress.

400
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,595
Why would I be distressed?

401
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:00,348
Hongjang told me

402
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:04,477
that you fell in love
with Grand Prince Jinhan.

403
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,898
Hongjang said that?

404
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:11,984
When?

405
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,738
I asked her to marry me upon my return,

406
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,784
but she insisted
that your marriage should come first.

407
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,497
That must have been her excuse

408
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,208
to prevent me
from paying for her ransom again

409
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,960
as she was a courtesan.

410
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,215
You should have just run away with her.

411
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,635
That is my greatest regret.

412
00:34:44,058 --> 00:34:45,143
Do not worry.

413
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:48,855
I will not be swayed no matter what.

414
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:13,254
Do you not mind the rumors going around?

415
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:17,633
What if the people believe the rumor,
form misconceptions of you,

416
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:19,635
and end up disliking you?

417
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:23,848
It does not matter.

418
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:27,727
Facing criticism from the people
is one of the king's responsibilities.

419
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:31,564
How could a child
fathom their father's heart?

420
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:35,026
It is the father's duty
to understand his child.

421
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:40,865
A single word of valid condemnation
from the people

422
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:44,035
holds far more value to a king

423
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:46,537
than the chatters
from his treacherous subjects.

424
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,087
You may say so now,

425
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,966
but should you hear
such condemnations yourself,

426
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,344
you would find it unbearable.

427
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,683
Would you like to bet?

428
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:14,023
Even if anyone dares to
condemn me for being attracted to men

429
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:16,234
and laugh at me to my face,

430
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:19,028
I, too, will laugh aloud with them.

431
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:25,117
If you fail to laugh, I win the bet.

432
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:30,706
I accept the terms.

433
00:36:37,004 --> 00:36:38,923
I understand your faith
in Captain Joo's skills,

434
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:41,050
but should you not bring more guards?

435
00:36:42,426 --> 00:36:43,261
Sang-hwa.

436
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:45,638
Mong-woo is worried about me.

437
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,599
They are there, just not noticeable.

438
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:49,809
Look closely.

439
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:51,727
Ten steps away.

440
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,438
Now, 50 steps away.

441
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,024
Now, 100 steps away.

442
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:59,277
My men are on duty
while keeping their distance.

443
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:09,370
It appears my concern was meaningless.

444
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:12,999
How is a subject's concern
for his king meaningless?

445
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,087
All right then, let us go find someone

446
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,048
who will call me out
for being attracted to men.

447
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:39,734
Choose a table if any takes your fancy.

448
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:41,610
I shall buy you one.

449
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:45,990
I do not need one, Your Majesty.

450
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,535
Were you not passionate
about <i>baduk </i>tables?

451
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,954
I used to be at one point.

452
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:53,247
But I am indifferent now.

453
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,126
It would be wise to exploit my generosity
when you have the chance.

454
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,295
At the end of the day,

455
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,422
I am your only patron.

456
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,637
Then…

457
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,890
I would like that, Your Majesty.

458
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,020
That?

459
00:38:28,282 --> 00:38:29,116
Move!

460
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,045
Here, take it.

461
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:02,191
Is it good?

462
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:15,162
We should visit other areas, Your Majesty.

463
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:18,582
You are currently losing.

464
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,459
Yes, the bet.

465
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:23,087
Let us see.

466
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,338
Where must I go

467
00:39:25,047 --> 00:39:27,466
to hear people call me out
for being attracted to men?

468
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,052
Stop eating and take the lead.

469
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,103
It seems I will lose at this rate.

470
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,111
I will place the stone here.

471
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,238
This move should do it.

472
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,660
You are quite good.
I will place my next stone here.

473
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,296
My next move is here.

474
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:12,386
Then I shall…

475
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,721
Stop.

476
00:40:13,804 --> 00:40:15,139
Not there. Try here.

477
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,269
Yes.

478
00:40:22,229 --> 00:40:23,189
There you go.

479
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:25,858
No.

480
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,444
Well done.

481
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:31,697
That is your play?

482
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,991
Hold on.

483
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:35,910
There.

484
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:46,086
There you go.

485
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,759
In that case…

486
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,782
Grandfather.

487
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:17,117
Look here.

488
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:19,703
What are you doing right now?

489
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:22,665
My apologies.

490
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,419
I am sorry. I got rather carried away.

491
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:30,923
- Let me help.
- No.

492
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:31,966
Forget it.

493
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,260
Goodness.

494
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:40,349
I do not need it.

495
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,433
On your feet.

496
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,770
Goodness.

497
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:50,192
Good grief.

498
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,444
Such annoying meddlers.

499
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,293
Your Majesty.

500
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:08,836
It is time for you to return.

501
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:10,296
How could this be?

502
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,047
Pardon?

503
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:14,174
I was told the rumor was everywhere.

504
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:16,594
But I cannot seem to
find anyone gossiping about it!

505
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,054
How come I am to be blamed for it?

506
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:20,889
I am not the one behind it.

507
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,266
I will lose to him again.

508
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:24,184
It is your fault if I lose this time!

509
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:25,853
Pardon?

510
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:28,772
Stop standing around like a pole

511
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:30,941
and go fetch me a rumor!

512
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:36,905
Yes, Your Majesty.

513
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,116
Please wait here.

514
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:46,582
Follow me!

515
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,214
Was I

516
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,091
too harsh?

517
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,637
I just ordered him
to fetch me an intangible notion.

518
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,601
Even if you ask Captain Joo
to pluck the moon from the sky,

519
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:06,727
he will see to it.

520
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:08,896
Looking back,

521
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:12,024
Sang-hwa has never
refused to carry out an order.

522
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:15,944
I am sure he is complaining in silence.

523
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:19,490
It would be a miracle
if he was not cursing me out.

524
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,845
If you were a woman,

525
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:44,098
I would have certainly married you.

526
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:01,490
By the way, have you heard the rumor?

527
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,283
Listen.

528
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:05,619
Apparently, the King is attracted to men.

529
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:07,996
Truly?

530
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,708
My goodness, how indecent.

531
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,585
If that were indeed true,
the world must be coming to an end.

532
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:15,671
Even with so many beautiful ladies
lining up for him?

533
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:16,797
Tell me about it.

534
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,465
Yet he favors men? Goodness.

535
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,475
Let us stop here for today.

536
00:44:30,686 --> 00:44:31,979
Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:35,691
Look…

538
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:47,870
Never mind.

539
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:19,234
My apologies.

540
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:42,925
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

541
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:45,719
I knew it.

542
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,222
I knew I was not.

543
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:49,848
Pardon?

544
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,309
Do not be so alarmed.

545
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:54,269
I was just testing something.

546
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:56,021
Testing?

547
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:59,233
Testing what, Your Majesty?

548
00:46:02,694 --> 00:46:04,154
It is nothing.

549
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:20,003
Do not use me
to test such a thing ever again!

550
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:49,229
Let us speak in private.

551
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,108
Can you lose the Special Firearms Unit?

552
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:56,778
Do not worry.

553
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,155
I have a plan.

554
00:48:13,378 --> 00:48:15,672
Goodness. Are you okay, my lord?

555
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:16,631
Move!

556
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:46,161
When you told me
to sever my emotional ties to you,

557
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:49,622
I felt deeply resentful.

558
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:52,292
However,

559
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:55,920
I now see that it was inevitable.

560
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:58,214
What is more,

561
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:01,092
it was not as painful as I thought.

562
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,096
What are you trying to say?

563
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,848
I have severed my emotional ties.

564
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:08,516
Now,

565
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:10,977
it is your turn.

566
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:26,344
I am Jaunyeong, the head courtesan here.

567
00:50:28,513 --> 00:50:30,098
Allow me to pour you a drink.

568
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,324
Why are you looking at me
with such sadness in your eyes?

569
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,329
I am sorry.

570
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,293
You remind me of a friend I treasured.

571
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:02,297
She must be a happy woman.

572
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:06,259
It is rare to find someone
who befriends a courtesan.

573
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:11,306
Can I ask you a question?

574
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:15,393
I am not sure if I will have the answer.

575
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:19,439
How do you…

576
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,985
sever your feelings for another?

577
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:36,039
At times, some have trouble letting go

578
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:38,416
and severing their feelings for another

579
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,377
even after their training is over

580
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:44,047
and they have become a courtesan.

581
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,592
I offer a line of advice
whenever I encounter one.

582
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:50,929
And what is that?

583
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,390
"Go where your heart takes you

584
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:56,935
until the very end of the road."

585
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:06,778
Once they reach the end of the road,

586
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:10,031
they understand…

587
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:14,661
the futility of love.

588
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:23,336
Has my answer been helpful?

589
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:27,882
Thank you.

590
00:52:31,594 --> 00:52:33,221
I would like to be alone.

591
00:54:02,477 --> 00:54:03,311
Captain Joo.

592
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:05,229
I have an urgent report.

593
00:54:05,313 --> 00:54:06,814
- What is wrong?
- Captain Joo!

594
00:54:09,776 --> 00:54:11,152
Captain Joo, there is trouble!

595
00:54:12,612 --> 00:54:14,447
Yoo Hyun-bo has disappeared.

596
00:54:15,782 --> 00:54:17,075
Has Kang Mong-woo disappeared as well?

597
00:54:22,497 --> 00:54:24,165
Do not inform His Majesty.

598
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:25,583
I will tell him myself.

599
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:29,921
Tell me what?

600
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:35,093
Your Majesty.

601
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:46,479
What is the matter?

602
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:52,026
Spit it out now.

603
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:53,569
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty!

604
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,696
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo has disappeared.

605
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:57,740
We lost Yoo Hyun-bo as well.

606
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:18,302
What brings you outside, Your Majesty?

607
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:28,938
Your Majesty.

608
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:32,316
Senior Court Lady Dong is here.

609
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,068
You must go inside.

610
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:45,496
Your Majesty.

611
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:25,286
If you were a woman,

612
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:27,622
I would have certainly married you.

613
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:38,132
Why does it hurt so much?

614
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:45,264
Did the rice cake from earlier
upset my insides?

615
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:29,725
Sleep will help me get over it.

616
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:34,480
I will let it all go.

617
00:58:54,018 --> 00:58:55,353
I cannot bring myself to do this.

618
00:58:56,854 --> 00:58:57,730
Your Majesty!

619
00:59:05,154 --> 00:59:06,364
Your Majesty!

620
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,146
Comb through the capital

621
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:41,273
and find Kang Mong-woo.

622
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:42,692
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

623
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:47,530
Your Majesty.

624
00:59:48,114 --> 00:59:50,324
Her Royal Highness
will be infuriated if she finds out.

625
00:59:50,408 --> 00:59:52,618
I promise to find the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

626
00:59:53,494 --> 00:59:55,538
- Please return to your quarters.
- You speak of promise

627
00:59:55,621 --> 00:59:57,790
when you have already lost him?

628
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,792
I apologize, Your Majesty.

629
01:00:00,584 --> 01:00:01,877
- However, Your Majesty--
- Quiet!

630
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:03,838
I will find him myself.

631
01:00:04,338 --> 01:00:06,090
Where did you lose him?

632
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:07,216
Lead the way.

633
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,551
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

634
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,566
Where on earth is he?

635
01:00:25,943 --> 01:00:28,195
He does not seem to be here.

636
01:00:34,118 --> 01:00:35,244
He must be there.

637
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:37,246
Your Majesty!

638
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:56,932
Is this not the place?

639
01:01:01,103 --> 01:01:02,021
Mong-woo.

640
01:01:18,662 --> 01:01:19,622
Goodness.

641
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:28,756
Your Majesty!

642
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:36,639
He will catch a cold out here.

643
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:39,475
Is there someplace he can stay nearby?

644
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:42,228
One place comes to mind.

645
01:01:42,311 --> 01:01:43,229
Where is it?

646
01:01:43,729 --> 01:01:45,231
Lord Kang Hang-soon's house.

647
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:49,860
Shall I find another place?

648
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:54,156
No need. Let us head there.

649
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:56,367
Go and check the place.

650
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,119
Please let me.

651
01:01:59,203 --> 01:02:01,372
Just help me get him on my back.

652
01:02:01,455 --> 01:02:02,331
Yes, Your Majesty.

653
01:02:09,755 --> 01:02:11,715
He must not be eating properly.

654
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,217
He is light as a feather.

655
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,726
Here.

656
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:33,487
Lights from the parlor
might catch prying eyes,

657
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:35,281
so I lit up the candles here.

658
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,575
You may leave.

659
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:40,411
Yes, Your Majesty.

660
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:17,656
No one may find out
that His Majesty is here.

661
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:20,451
Guard the vicinity in secret.

662
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:21,827
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

663
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:29,376
You rascal.

664
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:33,631
How come you drank so much
when you cannot hold your liquor?

665
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:47,686
It must be uncomfortable
to sleep with the hat on.

666
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,566
There.

667
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,611
Lie down comfortably.

668
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:05,371
You cannot have a good sleep
on your side, you fool.

669
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:07,831
Here.

670
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:11,251
There you go.

671
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:15,965
Let me untie your robe.

672
01:04:28,394 --> 01:04:29,561
Are you awake?

673
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:30,646
Do not be surprised.

674
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:31,814
No!

675
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:46,620
What do you mean by…

676
01:05:02,177 --> 01:05:03,220
Your Majesty.

677
01:05:08,392 --> 01:05:09,393
Do not tell me…

678
01:05:17,192 --> 01:05:18,360
You cannot be.

679
01:05:18,944 --> 01:05:20,154
Tell me you are not.

680
01:05:47,765 --> 01:05:49,141
I warned you

681
01:05:50,517 --> 01:05:53,812
that I would take your life
the moment I find any deceit.

682
01:05:56,023 --> 01:05:56,982
Your Majesty.

683
01:06:07,284 --> 01:06:08,619
I have a wish.

684
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:14,500
You assured me
you would not beg me to spare your life.

685
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,175
It is my final wish

686
01:06:24,718 --> 01:06:26,136
before death.

687
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:30,432
Speak your wish!

688
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:34,163
What in the world…

689
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:12,946
CAPTIVATING THE KING

690
01:10:13,488 --> 01:10:16,700
<i>You have deceived me on all counts.</i>

691
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:19,745
<i>You are not to come to the palace
for the time being</i>

692
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:22,664
<i>and to await my orders
while confined to your lodgings.</i>

693
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:26,001
The King has found out that I am a woman.

694
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:30,964
<i>I hope you have not forgotten
the promise you made</i>

695
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:32,382
to dismiss and expel the <i>gidaeryeong.</i>

696
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:33,675
I have not.

697
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:37,554
<i>The King has set up a trap
that the Principal Director cannot avoid.</i>

698
01:10:38,138 --> 01:10:40,015
Immediately arrest
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo

699
01:10:40,098 --> 01:10:41,767
<i>and bring him to the State Tribunal.</i>
