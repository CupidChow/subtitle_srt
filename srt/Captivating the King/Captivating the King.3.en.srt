1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:44,919
CAPTIVATING THE KING

2
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:50,420
Do you two…

3
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:53,507
know each other?

4
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:55,592
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:57,928
Very well, at that.

6
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:00,931
Is that not true?

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,481
Your Highness.

8
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,776
Could I ask if you are here
to play <i>baduk </i>against him?

9
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:13,902
That is correct.

10
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,905
Are you here for the same reason?

11
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:17,948
Yes.

12
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:21,243
Please forgive me,
but you will have to let me play today.

13
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,291
But I came before you did.

14
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,584
I still have the priority.

15
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,504
We promised to play today long ago.

16
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,467
You tell him.

17
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:52,649
My apologies.

18
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,239
I would like nothing more

19
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,658
than to insist that our game comes first,

20
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,619
but that would put you
in a difficult spot, Mongwoo.

21
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,205
I will let you off the hook.

22
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:10,584
Make no excuses next time.
Do you understand?

23
00:02:13,712 --> 00:02:15,005
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,397
Your Highness.

25
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,196
- Step back.
- You step back, my lady.

26
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:40,655
Or…

27
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:43,533
shall I reveal everything to His Highness?

28
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:48,788
I shall see you again.

29
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:12,520
EPISODE 3

30
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:19,653
What is your name?

31
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,321
It is Hongjang.

32
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,449
We need some privacy. Please excuse us.

33
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:25,951
You may speak freely.

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,870
Hongjang is my trusted confidant.

35
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,581
How are you so brazen
when you do not know what I will say?

36
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:37,420
I will be outside.

37
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,464
Please speak in privacy.

38
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:48,515
Is the Chief State Councilor

39
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:51,184
aware of your escapade in such an attire?

40
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:57,983
Let me go.

41
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,109
Answer me.

42
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,152
Am I being interrogated?

43
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:02,195
Interrogated?

44
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,823
Do you even know
what happens in interrogation?

45
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:06,825
If you get reported
dressed as you are now,

46
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,744
Hanseong Magistracy will arrest you
for disturbing public order

47
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:11,913
with obscene and outrageous behavior.

48
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:14,874
You will be tortured
until your skin breaks and shows blood.

49
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,167
<i>That</i> is interrogation.

50
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,006
Do you understand

51
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:23,758
what kind of risk you are taking?

52
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:30,181
Even the Chief State Councilor
will not be able to cover up your crimes.

53
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,809
Failing to keep
his depraved daughter in order

54
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,061
will place him in danger too.

55
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,980
Are you threatening me?

56
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,484
If my words of concern

57
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,945
sounded like a threat, then fine.

58
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,282
Let it be a threat
as long as I can stop you from--

59
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:53,330
My lady!

60
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,751
My lady, what happened?

61
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:01,963
He seems to be suffering
from a sudden stomachache.

62
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,382
Word will spread if you call a physician,

63
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:07,135
so have the servants
take him to his house.

64
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,219
Yes, my lady.

65
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,560
Have a safe trip home.

66
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,730
How do you know

67
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,440
Grand Prince Jinhan?

68
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:24,652
"Mongwoo"?

69
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,781
That was how His Highness addressed you.

70
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:29,616
You two looked very close.

71
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,163
Is he the reason you refuse to marry me?

72
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,670
I refuse to marry you

73
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:46,758
because you are an awful <i>baduk</i> player
who does not heed others' words.

74
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,761
On top of that,
you are dull and utterly disrespectful.

75
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,349
Do not blame others for your flaws.

76
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,105
What can I do
to make you understand how I feel?

77
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,984
Do you still consider me
as a potential marriage partner

78
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:07,987
despite my obscene
and outrageous behavior?

79
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,697
My heart for you remains the same.

80
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,951
No matter how angry you are,
do not belittle

81
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:15,453
my feelings for you.

82
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,794
I am only saying this out of concern.
Quit this act now.

83
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,714
I have

84
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,676
a reason for doing this.

85
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,844
Is that reason

86
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,054
more important than your reputation?

87
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,349
Is it more important than your family
and your father's honor?

88
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:37,809
I do this to save people.

89
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,607
If it is for such a noble cause,

90
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,278
I assume you would not mind me
informing the Chief State Councilor.

91
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:56,661
My lord, this is Hongjang.

92
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,121
I have brought a servant.

93
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:00,665
What will you do?

94
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,877
It is up to you.

95
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:35,575
Never did I imagine
I would be forced to quit like this.

96
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:40,538
You could not have continued this
for a long time anyway.

97
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,043
You did enough.

98
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,295
Do not be distressed.

99
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,008
Thank you for saying that.

100
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:56,763
Does His Highness

101
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,307
weigh on your mind?

102
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,441
I will not be able to
keep my promise to him.

103
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,486
There is no helping it.

104
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:15,990
But…

105
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,497
I do not understand why
my heart feels so painful.

106
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,752
It is only natural.

107
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:31,965
How could you not be in pain
when you are cutting ties with your love?

108
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,972
My lady.

109
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,680
When I asked him to play <i>baduk </i>with me,

110
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:23,558
he made all sorts of excuses
to avoid playing.

111
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,726
But with Kim Myung-ha,

112
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:28,938
he even agreed on a date
in advance, did he?

113
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,571
What he hides from me,
I am sure he shares with Kim Myung-ha.

114
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:37,905
Does…

115
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:39,782
Does he know his name too?

116
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,333
That is not important anyway.

117
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:53,004
Your Highness, this is Sang-hwa.

118
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,218
I have brought tea.

119
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:00,345
Leave it.

120
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:09,145
Something must not be going your way.

121
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,271
That is not true.

122
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,902
Do not act like you understand the game
when you have no idea.

123
00:10:16,903 --> 00:10:17,779
Yes, Your Highness.

124
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:22,033
But…

125
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,410
why are you so upset?

126
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,497
Did something happen
between you and Mongwoo?

127
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:30,500
Do not tell me

128
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:33,044
you lost to him again.

129
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:34,712
Goodness.

130
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:39,008
I did not even have the chance
to sit in front of the <i>baduk </i>table.

131
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,428
He had a previous engagement,

132
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:44,722
so I just came home.

133
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:52,814
What is it?

134
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,567
What are you trying to imply
by that disrespectful noise?

135
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:59,445
Please forgive me. It was nothing.

136
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,366
Sorry?

137
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,326
How dare you?

138
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:08,788
Right, so…

139
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:11,165
You are upset and frustrated

140
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,461
as you did not even get to place a stone
though you went to see him in excitement.

141
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,297
Do you like him that much?

142
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:23,052
Yes, I do.

143
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:26,305
I do not simply like him.

144
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,516
I am very fond of him.

145
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,145
In my eyes, he is just a common gambler.

146
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,147
Why do you like him so much?

147
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,400
He trusted me

148
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,695
when no one else did.

149
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:44,282
When people turned away from me
and condemned me,

150
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,701
he fought on my behalf.

151
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:49,454
You have me as well.

152
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,124
You are my right-hand man, Sang-hwa.

153
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:02,800
Shall I go find him and drag him here?

154
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:03,801
Leave him be.

155
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,596
We promised to meet again
on the day of <i>mongwoo</i>.

156
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,016
What if he forgets and does not show up?

157
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,769
He will not forget.

158
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:19,025
I have something he desperately wants.

159
00:12:34,332 --> 00:12:36,667
Your Highness,
are you entering the palace?

160
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:37,877
Yes.

161
00:12:39,128 --> 00:12:40,171
If you will excuse me.

162
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:42,423
By the way…

163
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,471
how was <i>baduk </i>that day?

164
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,059
The thing is,

165
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,560
we were not able to play.

166
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:55,561
He…

167
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,526
Mongwoo had to attend to
an urgent and important matter,

168
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,152
so he had to leave the capital.

169
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,404
We bade each other farewell
soon after you left.

170
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,114
An urgent and important matter?

171
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:10,368
Did something happen to him?

172
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,955
I do not know,
as he did not share the news.

173
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,290
However,

174
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,586
he mentioned that he would not be able to
return for a long time.

175
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:48,698
MONGWOO

176
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:50,658
<i>From now on,</i>

177
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:52,785
<i>you are Mongwoo.</i>

178
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,412
<i>My </i>manghyeongjiu,

179
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,372
<i>Mongwoo.</i>

180
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:26,569
Are you happy?

181
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,112
Of course.

182
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:31,324
My heart feels so light
that I might even start to float.

183
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,002
<i>Please hold onto this.</i>

184
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:45,129
<i>I will take it back</i>

185
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,465
<i>the next time there is a drizzle.</i>

186
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:52,011
<i>He mentioned that he would not be able to
return for a long time.</i>

187
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:54,388
It does not matter.

188
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,850
We made a promise,

189
00:14:58,351 --> 00:14:59,393
so I shall wait.

190
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,156
Open the gates!

191
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,492
I have an urgent report from Uiju!

192
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:44,397
Your Majesty.

193
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:48,484
The Nightshift Royal Secretary
urgently requests an audience.

194
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:52,822
Let him enter.

195
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:24,645
Summon the officials
of the Border Defense Council immediately!

196
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:25,813
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:35,322
Why has His Majesty
summoned the Border Defense Council?

198
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,408
A report arrived from Uiju.

199
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:40,077
A large group of Qing troops
have been stationed at the border,

200
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:41,829
with some invading Uiju.

201
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:46,292
Did the Magistrate of Uiju
bring the report himself?

202
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,626
He sent a messenger.

203
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,588
Magistrate Ko Myeong-tak
was captured first and had his hair cut.

204
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,924
Interpreter Jung is on his way
as the envoy's proxy.

205
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:56,635
They must have had a justifiable cause
for mobilizing the troops.

206
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,970
What is that cause?

207
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,014
Well…

208
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:03,476
There has been a report
of a breach of the peace treaty

209
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,394
whereby a spy named Chu Dal-ha

210
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:07,480
was dispatched to the Ming
to communicate with them.

211
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,275
Did you just say Chu Dal-ha?

212
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,694
Do you recognize the name?

213
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,158
If you will excuse me.

214
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,166
How do you know him?

215
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,627
Years ago,

216
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,921
he served as an officer
of the Central Army.

217
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:33,089
Recently,

218
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,342
I have seen him at a courtesan's house
that Grand Prince Jinhan frequents.

219
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,804
Are you saying you saw
the Grand Prince meeting with him?

220
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,473
That is correct.

221
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,351
I saw them clearly with my two eyes.

222
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,522
Keep this a secret

223
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,524
for the time being.

224
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:53,442
Do you understand?

225
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,361
Yes, my lord.

226
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,366
Your Majesty.

227
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,993
The Qing's invasion of the border

228
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,621
and forcing the Magistrate of Uiju
to take on their hairstyle

229
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:09,291
show their utter disregard
for both you and your court.

230
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,336
Please condemn their actions
upon Interpreter Jung's arrival

231
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,507
and order them
to leave our land immediately!

232
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:21,512
I concur with the Principal Director
of the Privy Council.

233
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:26,100
We cannot stand idly and watch
such atrocities of those brutes!

234
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,726
It is only right

235
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,272
to send our troops
to discipline and drive them out!

236
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:35,317
I beg for your understanding!

237
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:38,988
- I beg for your understanding!
- I beg for your understanding!

238
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,456
The disgrace I endured during the last war
has been engraved into my bones,

239
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,835
and the pain from it
makes me tremble to this day!

240
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:56,380
Yet you still want me
to take action against the Qing?

241
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:02,469
Minister of War, answer me.

242
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,725
Must I mobilize the troops?

243
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,979
Your Majesty.

244
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:16,525
We must be prepared for war
when mobilizing the troops.

245
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,819
If we go against them
without a solid plan,

246
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,488
yet another war will be inevitable.

247
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,408
It would be foolish to take such action.

248
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,703
I would rather be a disgraced commoner

249
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:29,830
than lead the country into a losing battle

250
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:33,459
and become a nuisance
to you and this nation.

251
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,255
Speak your ideas.

252
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,012
Your Majesty.

253
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,557
Interpreter Jung is making way
as we speak.

254
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:50,392
I will have a meeting with him

255
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:53,896
and investigate this incident thoroughly.

256
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:58,525
It will not be too late
to come up with a solution after that.

257
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,365
We shall do that.

258
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:09,870
Minister Kim, you will accompany
the Chief State Councilor to the meeting.

259
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:12,957
- We shall carry out your command.
- We shall carry out your command.

260
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,631
Master.

261
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,259
I will join you too.

262
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,885
I will be of help.

263
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,722
You have given enough help.

264
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:30,641
However, Master…

265
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:34,186
This is not your place to interfere,
Your Highness!

266
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,313
Please stay back.

267
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:47,408
Principal Drafter Kim.

268
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:56,041
Interpreter Jung likes to flaunt his power

269
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,752
and is overeager for a chance
to distinguish himself.

270
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:01,714
Thus, he will try to worsen the situation.

271
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,341
Keep that in mind when making decisions.

272
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,055
I will, Your Highness.

273
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:23,736
Do you have any idea

274
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,489
how great the Emperor's wrath was?

275
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:29,867
Everyone was trembling

276
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,870
as one outspoken word
could cost their lives.

277
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,998
One must crawl before him
to dare seek his audience!

278
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,084
Things were so bad

279
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:43,130
that even Prince Rui
ordered us to fend for ourselves!

280
00:21:43,213 --> 00:21:47,176
This is a bolt out of the blue
for Joseon's court as well.

281
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:51,930
You know better than anyone
the amount of effort we have put in

282
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,641
to maintain the peace between the nations.

283
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:56,977
That very knowledge is what bothers me.

284
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,855
You may grovel and flatter
before the Qing's presence,

285
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,399
but you continue to fraternize
with the Ming in secret.

286
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,861
I am more than well aware
of your discourteous nature.

287
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:08,989
Did Chu Dal-ha

288
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,242
confess that he received an order

289
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:15,162
from His Majesty and the court?

290
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:16,205
That rogue

291
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:18,916
is a madman.

292
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:22,002
He must have nerves of steel.

293
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,462
We poked and prodded him

294
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:26,173
and even threatened
to have both his eyes plucked.

295
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,300
In the end,
we did pluck out one of his eyes,

296
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:31,303
but he stayed silent.

297
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:36,016
Is there a way

298
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:40,229
to soothe the Emperor's wrath?

299
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:43,232
This incident

300
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:46,193
is a direct violation of a clause
in the peace treaty

301
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:49,488
and a clear act of betrayal.

302
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:50,572
Therefore,

303
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:53,450
would you not agree
that the price needs to be paid?

304
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:55,786
And what would that be?

305
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:00,457
Find the man

306
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,251
behind this spy.

307
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,670
I do not care who it is.

308
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:07,172
If we take that criminal to Shenyang

309
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:10,425
and make them confess their sins
and be punished before the Emperor,

310
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,637
it just might appease his ire.

311
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,687
The man behind the spy?

312
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:26,275
How dare a mere interpreter
belittle His Majesty with such vile words?

313
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,694
What if Chu Dal-ha
was dispatched to the Ming

314
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,446
by someone else's order?

315
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:33,490
That is ridiculous.

316
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:37,035
Who else would dare dispatch a spy
other than His Majesty?

317
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,371
You are right.

318
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:41,498
If someone else acted thusly,

319
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,043
they must be treacherous indeed.

320
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:47,880
- Treacherous?
- What is he implying?

321
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:50,424
Who could have dared to harbor
such heinous thoughts?

322
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:52,217
Do you have someone you suspect?

323
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,678
Chu Dal-ha.

324
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:58,140
That man frequented
a certain courtesan house…

325
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,979
and Grand Prince Jinhan
was seen visiting the place.

326
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:07,274
- The Grand Prince?
- What?

327
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:08,525
Minister Kim.

328
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:11,904
It is wise to avoid saying things
you cannot take responsibility for.

329
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,573
Unless you have a life to spare, that is.

330
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,493
It slipped my mind

331
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:21,747
that you were his uncle,
Principal Director.

332
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,664
However,

333
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:25,250
it seems like
you are forgetting something as well.

334
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:27,419
The principal director

335
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,297
is a mere honorary position

336
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,383
with nothing but a name.

337
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,221
You are His Majesty's subject.

338
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:41,099
Your eagerness to get the Prince Royal
to be named the heir is understandable.

339
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,477
But being so easily swayed

340
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,562
by a mere hound of the outlanders

341
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:48,065
is distasteful, is it not?

342
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,243
<i>I should have listened to you</i>

343
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,995
<i>when you advised me against sending a spy.</i>

344
00:25:03,497 --> 00:25:04,623
Do you not agree?

345
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,877
They say the Qing's might is on the rise,

346
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:12,798
but the Ming is just as powerful as them.

347
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:17,052
Sending a spy was your last resort
in these difficult times

348
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:19,596
to protect this nation and its people

349
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,057
and to avoid suffering from war.

350
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:24,017
I carried out your command

351
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,937
as I understood your intention.

352
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,527
Continue speaking.

353
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:38,323
Though their troops have invaded our land,

354
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:40,158
their chief envoy was not sent forth.

355
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:43,245
Seeing as Interpreter Jung was dispatched,

356
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:44,955
their goal seems to be

357
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:50,794
ensuring that we sever ties with the Ming
rather than going to war.

358
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:53,964
Then…

359
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:56,800
what do you propose I do?

360
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:01,388
I will kneel before the Emperor of Qing

361
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,725
and confess my crimes.

362
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,319
I cannot allow that.

363
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,116
Your Majesty.

364
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:25,495
No official will volunteer aside from me,

365
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,707
and the Emperor
will not accept anyone else either.

366
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,753
Please give me your approval

367
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,505
for my request, Your Majesty.

368
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,814
It seems like

369
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,818
the Chief State Councilor
will be taking all the blame.

370
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:00,030
The matter should not be let to rest

371
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:02,240
with a treasonous criminal out and about.

372
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:04,534
A treasonous criminal?

373
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:06,953
Are you suspecting Grand Prince Jinhan?

374
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,705
It is not a mere suspicion.

375
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:09,915
I am convinced.

376
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,793
Is there anyone

377
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:16,338
who can bear witness
that the Grand Prince is behind Chu Dal-ha

378
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:17,506
other than yourself?

379
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,299
A courtesan named Hongjang

380
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:23,303
and her patron, a <i>baduk </i>gambler,
are in league with the Grand Prince.

381
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,430
If we bring them in for interrogation,

382
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:27,682
I think we can get them to confess.

383
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:32,104
Listen to my order carefully
and carry it out,

384
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:34,731
Assistant Section Chief Yoo.

385
00:27:35,315 --> 00:27:36,316
Yes, my lord.

386
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:42,656
<i>Father.</i>

387
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:46,785
What do you mean
by saying that you must travel afar?

388
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:49,329
Are you going to the Qing as an envoy?

389
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,375
It is something of the sort.

390
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,337
When will you be leaving?

391
00:27:58,004 --> 00:27:59,923
I will need to prepare
clothes and other provisions,

392
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,509
but I fear I might not be able to
within a short time.

393
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:03,969
There is no need for that.

394
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:05,887
I will take care of it.

395
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,516
Father.

396
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,643
Are you really

397
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:13,979
going as an envoy?

398
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:19,025
Hee-soo.

399
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,114
My lord.

400
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:26,700
What is it?

401
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:33,665
You have a guest, my lord.

402
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:35,125
Did they mention their name?

403
00:28:35,709 --> 00:28:37,377
It is Grand Prince Jinhan.

404
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:40,172
It is late today.

405
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:42,924
Tell him I will go see him tomorrow.

406
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:48,138
Why are you standing there?

407
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:50,223
Well…

408
00:28:50,807 --> 00:28:54,060
He said he would not leave
until he could speak to you.

409
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:57,814
All right then.

410
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:19,753
Your Highness.

411
00:29:19,836 --> 00:29:21,671
- Master.
- Good grief.

412
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:24,132
Please forgive me
for intruding at this hour.

413
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:29,596
Is she your daughter?

414
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,306
Yes.

415
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,433
She is my only daughter.

416
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:38,063
Dear, come greet His Highness.

417
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:41,691
What are you doing, my lady?

418
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:43,652
Hurry up and greet His Highness.

419
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,660
Please forgive her.

420
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,871
She must be bewildered
to be in your presence so suddenly

421
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:57,040
and must be feeling shy.

422
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:58,208
It is all right.

423
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:01,127
I have no time for greetings.

424
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:04,422
I came in a rush as I must speak to you
on an urgent matter.

425
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:06,716
Please come in.

426
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,399
My lady.

427
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:26,528
The world must be bigger
than what I had imagined.

428
00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:30,031
I never thought I would see someone
more handsome than Lord Kim.

429
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:31,825
Who is he?

430
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:34,619
He is Grand Prince Jinhan.

431
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:37,664
You mean

432
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:40,458
the King's younger brother
who recently returned from the Qing?

433
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:43,336
I wonder what brought him here
at this late hour.

434
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:45,547
Are you curious?

435
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,173
Shall I look into it?

436
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:50,093
How would you manage that?

437
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,053
<i>Master.</i>

438
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:54,306
Please send me in your stead.

439
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,308
I will go forth

440
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:58,184
and persuade Prince Rui.

441
00:30:58,268 --> 00:30:59,895
As long as Prince Rui is convinced,

442
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:02,814
the Emperor's wrath
will be subsided in no time.

443
00:31:02,898 --> 00:31:04,065
I cannot do that.

444
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,528
What is the reason?

445
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:12,073
Chu Dal-ha is my man.

446
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:15,702
I carried it out on His Majesty's orders,

447
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:17,996
so it is only right that I go.

448
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,415
I already feel terrible
about the rumor of you being a spy.

449
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,293
I cannot burden you with another concern.

450
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:26,129
Is that why

451
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:29,341
you told me to stay back

452
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:32,719
when you were
going to meet Interpreter Jung?

453
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,890
When the rumor about you
spread across the capital,

454
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:40,518
I was going to counsel His Majesty
that should you be called a spy,

455
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:43,897
it was only right to call you
His Majesty's spy of my choosing

456
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,066
and not a spy of Prince Rui.

457
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,360
However, it has been some time

458
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:52,739
since His Majesty did not heed me
on matters regarding you.

459
00:31:52,822 --> 00:31:55,158
It is because of that clause
in the peace treaty.

460
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:57,827
"If an unexpected event befalls you,

461
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:02,123
the hostage that I have taken
will inherit the throne."

462
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:03,833
I was informed

463
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,836
Prince Rui asked the Emperor
to add such a clause.

464
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,296
He is a terrifying man.

465
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:12,384
He kept me close as if I was his favorite,
listening to my requests.

466
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,761
Taking me to his battle,

467
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:16,388
approving my sudden repatriation,

468
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:19,182
and releasing our people so benevolently.

469
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,351
All that must be
a part of his devious trick

470
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:24,062
to control me and my brother
and breed enmity between us.

471
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:29,192
Did his devious trick
affect you in any way?

472
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:31,319
Yes.

473
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,655
It did, indeed.

474
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,324
While watching innocent people

475
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:40,495
being stomped to death
by the hooves of the Qing cavalry,

476
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,749
I thought that such a tragic war
should never happen again.

477
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:45,792
And if…

478
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:48,253
such a war is inevitable,

479
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:52,632
I would fight to win at all costs.

480
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,012
Your Highness.

481
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,096
Master.

482
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:01,224
I know Prince Rui.

483
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:03,059
I know the tricks up his sleeves.

484
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:04,978
Please send me instead.

485
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:08,356
I can fight against him.

486
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:31,212
Leaving to confess my crimes
to the Emperor of Qing

487
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:34,299
is my duty as His Majesty's subject

488
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:35,884
and the head of the court.

489
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:37,886
I cannot burden you

490
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:40,764
with such an important task.

491
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,519
You must be faithful to your duties,
Your Highness.

492
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,021
Stay by His Majesty's side.

493
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:52,233
Do you think he will
keep me by his side with you gone?

494
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:56,029
Do you remember the words
of the wise scholars that I read

495
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:58,490
on the first day of our class?

496
00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:05,038
To wish for life when you love them…

497
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:08,416
and death when you hate them.

498
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,836
Wishing them to live
while wishing them to die.

499
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:15,924
That is what it means to be captivated.

500
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:18,384
Those words

501
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:22,263
have been His Majesty's favorite
since his days at the Royal Institute.

502
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:25,016
His Majesty is trying his utmost

503
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,394
to be freed from being captivated.

504
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:33,399
You must also be careful
not to be captivated, Your Highness.

505
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:38,488
As long as both of you try your best
to escape captivation,

506
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,992
the good old days
of the two loving brothers

507
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,410
shall return one day.

508
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:47,622
Master.

509
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:51,251
I might continue lecturing you
if I stay any longer.

510
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,961
Please excuse me.

511
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:54,671
Please…

512
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:56,881
return home safely.

513
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:39,424
Hee-soo.

514
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,052
Father.

515
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:48,016
I mulled over what you told me earlier

516
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,393
about the long-distance trip.

517
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,938
I simply must follow you this time.

518
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,903
My dear Hee-soo.

519
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:00,987
Do not try to stop me.

520
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:04,616
No matter what you say,

521
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:07,368
I will not listen.

522
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:14,000
I am traveling under a royal command.

523
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,003
As a criminal.

524
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:25,386
I will return safely

525
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,473
like I always have.

526
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:43,780
Father…

527
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:47,700
My dear.

528
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:53,206
You must also

529
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:55,959
stay safe and sound.

530
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,045
Do you understand?

531
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:18,606
Please do not be distressed.

532
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,943
The matter is something
beyond your control.

533
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,194
I wish to be left alone.

534
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:25,446
Please leave me be.

535
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:50,138
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

536
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,432
I am here to see Interpreter Jung.

537
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,058
Please report to him.

538
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:04,986
The Minister of War
told me to show you a letter

539
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:07,155
and to get an answer from you.

540
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:10,575
I brought ten such chests.

541
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,912
You girls may leave.

542
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,680
What…

543
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:34,682
What is this?

544
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:37,101
Grand Prince Jinhan

545
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:40,188
is the one who had Chu Dal-ha's back?

546
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,647
It is as you read.

547
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:45,818
Grand Prince Jinhan, Yi In,
is Chu Dal-ha's backer,

548
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:50,073
and the mastermind
who sent him to the Ming as a spy.

549
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:52,325
So?

550
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:54,452
Do you have evidence or witnesses?

551
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:56,120
Of course.

552
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:59,123
There is a witness
who is willing to attest to it.

553
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,542
If it is not an effective
witness or evidence,

554
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:03,795
you can forget this.

555
00:39:04,337 --> 00:39:06,381
If this falls through,

556
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,300
the Grand Prince
will rush forward to have my head.

557
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,819
I cannot delay the trip to Uiju

558
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:31,155
as a Qing commander with a greatsword
is waiting for me.

559
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:32,949
But what I can do

560
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:35,034
is to travel slowly.

561
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:37,703
That means…

562
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:39,956
I can attempt to buy a few days

563
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,833
after we arrive at Uiju.

564
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,585
If Grand Prince Jinhan is brought by then,

565
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:49,715
I will give you my word
to transfer him to the Qing.

566
00:39:53,886 --> 00:39:55,221
I shall convey your message.

567
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:25,042
Your Majesty.

568
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,587
Please be healthy and well

569
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:30,756
until the day we meet again.

570
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:02,580
My lord.

571
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,291
Do not worry about Lady Hee-soo.

572
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,627
I will look after her.

573
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:10,463
Thank you.

574
00:41:49,502 --> 00:41:50,628
<i>Step back!</i>

575
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:07,812
My lord.

576
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:09,647
Step back.

577
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,315
My lord!

578
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:14,652
Excuse me.

579
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,487
Step back.

580
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:19,448
These are padded clothes
to help him withstand the North's cold!

581
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:21,742
Is it so wrong to bring him some clothes?

582
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:24,161
- I told you to step back!
- Goodness.

583
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,664
- Jageunnyeon…
- You should be careful.

584
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,499
Thank you.

585
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:33,004
Excuse me.

586
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:35,798
- I said--
- Thank you for all your work.

587
00:42:37,049 --> 00:42:38,050
Thank you.

588
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:41,178
My lord.

589
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:49,937
My lady.

590
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,074
Your Highness.

591
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,493
I am afraid you must go back.

592
00:43:05,536 --> 00:43:07,580
Will he not take herbal medicine today?

593
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,541
That is not it.

594
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:13,085
He is distressed
about the Chief State Councilor

595
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:15,504
and ordered me
to forbid anyone from coming in.

596
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:18,049
I understand.

597
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,510
Please look after His Majesty.

598
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:24,138
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:43:43,407 --> 00:43:45,409
My lady, look.

600
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:01,550
What brings you here?

601
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:17,525
I brought the Chief State Councilor's
court robe.

602
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:34,625
I promised him
that I would look after you.

603
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,420
Send me word
if there is anything I can help you with.

604
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,921
I will come to you immediately.

605
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:44,093
Thank you for your words,

606
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:47,763
but I will not be needing your help.

607
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:04,613
I have the horse ready.

608
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:06,949
Where shall we go?

609
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:09,994
Take me wherever it may be,

610
00:45:10,077 --> 00:45:11,912
where I can ride with the wind.

611
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:33,911
I am lonely.

612
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,333
I feel so lonely.

613
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,757
Comfort me, will you?

614
00:47:06,277 --> 00:47:07,319
Your Majesty.

615
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:11,282
The Minister of War, Kim Jong-bae,
requests an audience.

616
00:47:17,413 --> 00:47:18,872
Not today.

617
00:47:18,956 --> 00:47:20,374
Tell him to come back again.

618
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,001
Your Majesty.

619
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:25,629
It is an urgent matter
that must be dealt with immediately.

620
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:32,011
Let him in.

621
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:44,106
What is this very urgent matter
that must be dealt with immediately?

622
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:47,067
Your Majesty.

623
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:51,822
We have a witness
willing to attest to the spy incident.

624
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:58,871
That matter has long been dealt with.

625
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:03,542
Tell me, who are they attesting against?

626
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:06,712
Grand Prince Jinhan,

627
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:08,714
Yi In, Your Majesty.

628
00:48:15,346 --> 00:48:16,430
Nonsense.

629
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:18,349
It is not nonsense.

630
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:21,810
Someone witnessed Grand Prince Jinhan
meeting the spy, Chu Dal-ha,

631
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:23,896
and came forward to report it.

632
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:25,064
Enough!

633
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,820
The Chief State Councilor
has sacrificed himself for all the crimes!

634
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:34,531
So why are you still on this case?

635
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:39,995
Your Majesty.

636
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:44,249
Kang Hang-soon only sacrificed himself
in order to deceive you and the court

637
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,711
and to hide Grand Prince Jinhan's crimes.

638
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:52,091
He would never deceive me.

639
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:55,010
Do not speak ill of him.

640
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:58,180
Kang Hang-soon had exchanged letters

641
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,391
with the Grand Prince
while he was in Shenyang.

642
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,394
What if he has an ulterior motive
other than seeking punishment?

643
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:05,187
What if it is to seek
the Emperor's approval

644
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:10,317
to have Grand Prince Jinhan
ascend to the throne?

645
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:15,823
Are you saying…

646
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:20,119
that Kang Hang-soon

647
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:24,707
plotted treason with my brother
and deceived me?

648
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:28,794
I am convinced

649
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,088
that is the case.

650
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,055
Can you swear this on your life?

651
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:49,189
If it is to continue your reign

652
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:52,234
and to punish the traitors,

653
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,278
then yes,

654
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:57,364
I can swear my life

655
00:49:58,532 --> 00:49:59,867
a thousand times over.

656
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,215
His Majesty has given his approval.

657
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:17,342
Arrest anyone who may attest

658
00:50:17,426 --> 00:50:19,845
that the Grand Prince
is behind Chu Dal-ha, the spy,

659
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:23,307
as well as everyone with connections
to the Grand Prince.

660
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,308
Yes, my lord.

661
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:27,686
- Goodness, what is going on?
- What is happening?

662
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,022
- Goodness me.
- Oh, my.

663
00:50:34,276 --> 00:50:35,736
Why do you look so surprised?

664
00:50:36,612 --> 00:50:37,905
Kill me or spare me.

665
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:39,615
Do as you please.

666
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:42,868
You foolish thing.

667
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,871
Do you think I am doing this
just to arrest you?

668
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:51,585
Do expect the worst.

669
00:50:52,377 --> 00:50:56,715
Grand Prince Jinhan and that <i>baduk </i>gambler

670
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,927
shall both accompany you
to the underworld.

671
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:03,222
Take her.

672
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:04,556
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

673
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,099
My lady!

674
00:51:12,314 --> 00:51:13,273
Out of the way!

675
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:16,318
Arrest all <i>baduk </i>gamblers you see!

676
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:17,402
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

677
00:51:25,744 --> 00:51:27,037
No! That table is mine!

678
00:51:27,663 --> 00:51:28,497
Get him!

679
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:31,083
Let me go!

680
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:35,295
Oh, my. My lady!

681
00:51:42,845 --> 00:51:44,012
Goodness, she is home.

682
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,487
My lady!

683
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,739
My lady!

684
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,662
Please stop!

685
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:12,624
Stop the torture!

686
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:18,630
Speak the name of the <i>baduk </i>gambler.

687
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:22,175
I do not know.

688
00:52:22,926 --> 00:52:24,511
I really do not know.

689
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:26,972
How many times do I have to tell you?

690
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:28,515
It is true.

691
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,809
We had to win to learn his name,

692
00:52:30,893 --> 00:52:33,061
but none of us did.

693
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:48,327
You know his name, do you not?

694
00:52:50,287 --> 00:52:51,914
If you speak his name,

695
00:52:51,997 --> 00:52:54,416
I will spare your life.

696
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,353
Do not stop the torture
until they speak of the name.

697
00:53:14,436 --> 00:53:15,729
That is enough!

698
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,444
My lord.

699
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:23,946
What shall I do?

700
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:32,788
Do not stop and continue.

701
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:02,526
Did you hear the news?

702
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:04,861
Kim Jong-bae has taken over
the State Tribunal

703
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:08,365
and is arresting anyone
acquainted with the Grand Prince.

704
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:09,658
For what reason?

705
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:13,620
He seems to suspect
that His Highness is behind the spy.

706
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:15,956
Where is His Highness?

707
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,791
He is neither in his residence
nor the palace.

708
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:19,459
He must have left the capital.

709
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,047
Did you not say

710
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:28,385
you had a plan for the Grand Prince?

711
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:30,971
But look what happened.

712
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:33,306
How could he be the man behind the spy?

713
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,559
Please calm down, Your Royal Highness.

714
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:39,146
His Majesty knows that cannot be true
better than anyone.

715
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,481
The Qing knows this as well,

716
00:54:41,565 --> 00:54:42,733
so if you wait a little--

717
00:54:42,816 --> 00:54:44,026
Shut that mouth of yours!

718
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:48,989
Stop blabbering

719
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:53,035
and go find a way
to save the Grand Prince.

720
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:55,328
Immediately.

721
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:04,087
<i>The capital has been turned upside down.</i>

722
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:09,259
I hear the King has ordered
the arrest of all <i>baduk </i>gamblers.

723
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:10,177
And they say

724
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,389
it is because of the dashing Grand Prince
who came to visit your father last time.

725
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,433
Because of Grand Prince Jinhan?

726
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:18,477
For what reason?

727
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:22,064
The leader of the patrol said something,
but I could not understand.

728
00:55:23,065 --> 00:55:24,107
Anyway,

729
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:28,111
even Hongjang got dragged away
by the patrolmen right before my eyes.

730
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,592
My lord.

731
00:55:50,675 --> 00:55:52,552
Someone is here to see you.

732
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,528
Are you the one looking for me?

733
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:16,243
Are you insane? How could you come here?

734
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:19,621
I heard you were torturing
innocent people to find me.

735
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:20,789
So I came.

736
00:56:21,665 --> 00:56:23,166
Do not be a fool and go home.

737
00:56:25,377 --> 00:56:27,379
- Stop.
- Let me go.

738
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:31,258
Look who is here.

739
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:36,012
Are you not Hongjang's patron?

740
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:40,142
Arrest him immediately.

741
00:56:40,225 --> 00:56:41,059
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

742
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,405
I see you have come on your own will.

743
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,867
Are you here to turn yourself in?

744
00:56:57,868 --> 00:56:59,578
Forgive my boldness,

745
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:03,165
but I only came to prove the innocence
of these people and the Grand Prince.

746
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:10,422
What an interesting man.

747
00:57:11,256 --> 00:57:12,090
Fine.

748
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:14,509
Let us hear what you have to say.

749
00:57:15,677 --> 00:57:16,761
As far as I know,

750
00:57:16,845 --> 00:57:18,889
Grand Prince Jinhan
does not know Chu Dal-ha.

751
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:22,434
And Chu Dal-ha
has never met the Grand Prince.

752
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:23,894
I do not know who attested

753
00:57:23,977 --> 00:57:25,979
that the Grand Prince
is behind Chu Dal-ha,

754
00:57:26,062 --> 00:57:28,482
but I am certain that they are lying.

755
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:31,860
My lord.

756
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:34,613
His words are not to be trusted.

757
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:37,699
Why would a <i>baduk </i>gambler
who gambles around with the Grand Prince

758
00:57:37,782 --> 00:57:39,826
tell the truth?

759
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,828
You are the one
who should speak the truth.

760
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:44,039
Why are you

761
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:46,791
defaming the innocent Grand Prince
in the sacred State Tribunal?

762
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,461
If you are doing this

763
00:57:49,544 --> 00:57:52,047
out of a grudge against him
for helping out your sister,

764
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:55,550
I advise you to confess
and right the wrongs.

765
00:57:55,634 --> 00:57:56,635
Shut your mouth.

766
00:57:57,802 --> 00:58:01,431
Who do you think you are
to run your mouth about me?

767
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:04,059
Is persecuting and agonizing
your sister not enough?

768
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,354
Why are you trying to have her killed
with false charges?

769
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:09,773
- You bastard--
- Enough.

770
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,199
That is enough.

771
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:24,412
Do you have more to say?

772
00:58:26,122 --> 00:58:27,082
My lord.

773
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:31,253
I know it is against the law
to arrest people without evidence

774
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:34,089
and interrogate them
while inflicting torture

775
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:36,007
just because they are acquainted
with a suspect.

776
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:39,302
Please be generous

777
00:58:40,178 --> 00:58:42,764
so that innocent people
may not suffer further.

778
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:45,183
I beg for a lenient treatment.

779
00:58:47,227 --> 00:58:49,604
Every word you have spoken is right.

780
00:58:49,688 --> 00:58:50,564
However,

781
00:58:51,481 --> 00:58:54,568
in such a turbulent time
with war looming over the nation,

782
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:57,529
generosity and leniency from officials

783
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,574
are poisons that crumble the nation.

784
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:06,830
- Sorry?
- Before you prove others of innocence,

785
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:09,332
you must prove your innocence first.

786
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,501
What are you waiting for?

787
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,129
Arrest him at once
and submit him to interrogation!

788
00:59:14,212 --> 00:59:15,130
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

789
00:59:16,548 --> 00:59:18,174
My lord.

790
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,093
Let me go!

791
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:25,807
Stop right this moment!

792
00:59:47,746 --> 00:59:48,913
Let go of him.

793
00:59:56,838 --> 00:59:58,173
I said, let go.

794
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:07,974
Are you all right?

795
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:11,436
Your Highness.

796
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:14,230
Your Highness.

797
01:00:17,317 --> 01:00:19,653
You have intruded and interfered
with the questioning

798
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:21,780
that was being carried out
under a royal command.

799
01:00:21,863 --> 01:00:24,616
What insolent behavior is this?

800
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:27,744
I would like to
return that question to you.

801
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:31,206
Did you forget that His Majesty
decreed against senseless torture?

802
01:00:31,873 --> 01:00:33,875
This is under His Majesty's approval.

803
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,427
His Majesty could not have told you
to go against the law.

804
01:00:44,511 --> 01:00:47,555
He clearly ordered me
to torture the criminals

805
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:49,599
until they confessed.

806
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,320
Stop torturing innocent people

807
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:05,448
and question me directly.

808
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:14,332
A tiny blade fit for a rabbit

809
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:17,794
would be ill-suited for a tiger hunt.

810
01:01:19,921 --> 01:01:22,340
I shall question you

811
01:01:23,466 --> 01:01:25,760
once I have gathered
proper evidence and witnesses.

812
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,847
So please be patient.

813
01:01:34,102 --> 01:01:36,271
I will meet His Majesty
and speak to him myself.

814
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:38,022
Stop the interrogation until then.

815
01:01:39,482 --> 01:01:40,900
If you lay a finger on them,

816
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:44,612
I will not sit back.

817
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:49,284
Understood.

818
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:01,296
I will return to save you.

819
01:02:02,005 --> 01:02:04,466
Do not worry and wait. Do you understand?

820
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:32,243
Your Majesty.

821
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:35,580
Grand Prince Jinhan requests an audience.

822
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:42,378
Let him in.

823
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:10,448
When the outlanders let you go unscathed,

824
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:12,992
I should have killed you then.

825
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,787
Then Kang Hang-soon

826
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,082
would not have joined you
and plotted to overthrow me.

827
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:20,291
Do you not agree?

828
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:26,339
What you say is utterly unjust.

829
01:03:27,215 --> 01:03:28,800
How could Master Kang…

830
01:03:30,802 --> 01:03:33,054
have joined me for such unthinkable deeds?

831
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:37,141
He has always considered your talents
to be greater than mine.

832
01:03:37,892 --> 01:03:39,769
Now that I am in this state,

833
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:44,315
he must have gotten tired
of serving me as his king.

834
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:49,696
Therefore, he plotted a treason
to replace me with you, is that not true?

835
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:54,033
You are the one who ordered him
to send a spy to the Ming, Your Majesty!

836
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,912
How could you

837
01:03:58,454 --> 01:04:01,541
defame your loyal subject
who took all the blame,

838
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:03,918
when he only carried out
your royal command?

839
01:04:04,002 --> 01:04:06,629
You are finally confessing the truth.

840
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:08,298
Go on.

841
01:04:09,048 --> 01:04:11,092
What else did he say?

842
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:15,221
Did he say he would take the blame

843
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:16,723
and urge you to oust me

844
01:04:16,806 --> 01:04:19,475
and take my throne
while my guard was down?

845
01:04:21,436 --> 01:04:22,520
Brother.

846
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:27,358
Please.

847
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,403
Please come to your senses.

848
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:31,487
Shut your mouth!

849
01:04:32,864 --> 01:04:35,575
I am not your brother!

850
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:37,994
I am the king of this nation!

851
01:04:39,037 --> 01:04:40,455
How dare you?

852
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:45,001
Who are you to tell me what to do
and order me around?

853
01:04:46,544 --> 01:04:49,005
- Brother!
- I will not sit back anymore.

854
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,966
I will kill you

855
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:56,262
and eliminate the future turmoil
you may bring to this nation!

856
01:05:05,146 --> 01:05:06,147
Die!

857
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:10,360
Die!

858
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:12,445
Die!

859
01:06:01,202 --> 01:06:04,163
CAPTIVATING THE KING

860
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:05,790
Bring the royal physician immediately!

861
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:07,792
<i>Now that the tiger is gone,</i>

862
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,253
<i>packs of hyenas will run wild.</i>

863
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:12,839
<i>Do you remember
what you told me last time?</i>

864
01:06:12,922 --> 01:06:14,465
<i>You told me that ascending to the throne,</i>

865
01:06:15,258 --> 01:06:18,928
<i>having the world at my command,
and governing this nation as its king</i>

866
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:22,015
<i>is my fate and to not deny it.</i>

867
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,226
<i>His Highness will save us no matter what.</i>

868
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:28,646
<i>A king only has his subjects
and political enemies.</i>

869
01:06:29,272 --> 01:06:30,857
<i>He keeps no such thing as friends.</i>

870
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,485
<i>He will be made to suffer this indignity.</i>

871
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:41,951
