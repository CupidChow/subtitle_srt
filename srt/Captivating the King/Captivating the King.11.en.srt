00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,198
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,507
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:09,868
PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY
FOLLOWED WHEN FILMING WITH ANIMALS

4
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,801
EPISODE 11

5
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,523
<i>Now that it has come to this,</i>

6
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,777
we must inform the King
before the Principal Director does.

7
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:31,987
That is the only way

8
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,823
to prevent the Grand Prince
from being suspected by the King.

9
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:40,454
I understand.

10
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,290
I will confess everything to the King.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,835
If you tell him a lie
to hide your treacherous heart,

12
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,962
he will only grow more suspicious.

13
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:51,715
Leave it up to me.

14
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,883
Please look after

15
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,719
the Grand Prince for now.

16
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:58,722
Are you saying
you will take all the blame?

17
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:01,266
Just how much are you planning
to disgrace me?

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,976
If you cannot bear this much,

19
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,563
you might as well give up the plan
to ascend the Grand Prince.

20
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:11,777
The King

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,696
will have you executed.

22
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:19,952
One must sacrifice something
to protect another.

23
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:23,497
If my life can salvage our plan,

24
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,501
we should consider ourselves lucky.

25
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:56,738
Lord Park.

26
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:59,074
Are you entering the palace
at this late hour?

27
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:08,709
I have come to report
an urgent matter to His Majesty.

28
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:22,139
It seems I have underestimated you,
Sixth Royal Secretary.

29
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:25,767
What do you mean?

30
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:27,978
Princess Jangryeong.

31
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:35,527
How will you handle
the consequences of such an act?

32
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,460
What is the matter?

33
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:58,759
Why are you hesitating?

34
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,804
Is it regarding your identity?

35
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,724
No, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,476
It is not about me,

37
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:10,354
but Her Highness.

38
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,149
Her Highness?
Do you mean Princess Jangryeong?

39
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,819
The one who is on her way
to the Qing to marry Prince Rui

40
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,656
is not Princess Jangryeong.

41
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,370
It is one of the court maids
who serve Her Highness.

42
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,751
Seeing as you are aware of this,

43
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:37,923
are you the person
who orchestrated her substitution?

44
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,094
Yes, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,268
Who ordered you to do this?

46
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:51,436
I did not do it on anyone's orders.

47
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,146
I did it on my own will.

48
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,273
My decision

49
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:57,109
to have the Princess wed Prince Rui

50
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,821
was to maintain the repatriation system
for the war captives

51
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,489
and prevent another war.

52
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,368
Why did you substitute the Princess
despite knowing this?

53
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,204
It was for that very reason

54
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:13,125
that I thought I had to help Her Highness,
even if no one else would.

55
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,253
Her pain and loneliness

56
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,548
from having her plea denied
and failing to protect her loved one

57
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,135
is something I understand
better than anyone.

58
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,479
How did the Principal Director find out?

59
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,649
A court lady of the Queen Dowager

60
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,319
noticed Bun-yeong's absence
and reported it to her.

61
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:43,280
Is Bun-yeong the court maid
who replaced the Princess?

62
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,282
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:50,829
Who else knows about this?

64
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:52,789
Me,

65
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:57,169
Her Highness, and Bun-yeong,
the three of us.

66
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:58,879
Grand Prince Munseong is unaware?

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,214
The Princess would not have hidden

68
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,300
such an important matter
from her only brother.

69
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:06,011
Well…

70
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:08,055
Is Kim Myung-ha aware of this?

71
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,439
Speak the truth!

72
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:20,192
Is Kim Myung-ha aware of this or not?

73
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,945
I have plotted everything.

74
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:29,701
I convinced the unwilling Grand Prince
and the Sixth Royal Secretary into it.

75
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,460
The crime you have committed

76
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:41,088
is high treason against me

77
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,924
that would call for an execution.

78
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:47,135
So why are you confessing?

79
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,182
Did you think

80
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:56,103
I could not take your life anymore?

81
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,940
Did you expect me to forgive your crimes
because I am in love with you?

82
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,569
Is it wrong to expect as much?

83
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:11,618
My crime against you

84
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,496
does not render my love for you false.

85
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,602
Is there anything else I should know?

86
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:41,273
Do not leave anything out and tell me.

87
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,493
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,871
It is disturbing to bring you this news.

89
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:59,166
I must report to you
the treacherous subjects

90
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:04,754
who dared to go against the royal command
and deceived you and the court.

91
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:09,426
Whose and what kind of deceit
are you talking about?

92
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,303
At Grand Prince Munseong's behest,

93
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,263
Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha

94
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,850
substituted Princess Jangryeong
with a court maid.

95
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,853
The Qing's Chief Envoy, Podan,
was enraged by the fact

96
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,772
that he stopped his journey
and now stays in Gaegyeong,

97
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:26,067
awaiting your arrival, Your Majesty.

98
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,736
Substitution?

99
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:29,404
Are you certain?

100
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:34,993
I went to Byeokjegwan myself
and confirmed it in the afternoon.

101
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:38,455
We must interrogate the Grand Prince
and Kim Myung-ha before daybreak

102
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,124
and arrest all those
who were in league with them.

103
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,794
Should you go to Gaegyeong after that,
you will be able to soothe Podan's anger.

104
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,838
I will interrogate them myself.

105
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,299
Heed my order, Sang-hwa.

106
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,469
Yes, Your Majesty.
Please give me your command.

107
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:55,305
Send the Special Firearms Unit
to the Grand Prince's quarters

108
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,932
and prohibit servants from entering.

109
00:07:57,516 --> 00:08:00,101
And arrest Sixth Royal Secretary
Kim Myung-ha and bring him here.

110
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:02,479
I shall carry out the royal command.

111
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,776
Eunuch Kim,
summon the Chief Royal Secretary.

112
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:08,944
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,740
Your Majesty.

114
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,868
I shall gather the Border Defense Council

115
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,663
and prepare for the interrogation.

116
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,584
Wait.

117
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:28,547
Before that,

118
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:34,427
there is something
I must confirm with you.

119
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,894
Listen up.

120
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,980
You will head
to Grand Prince Munseong's quarters

121
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:46,690
and bar the servants from entering.

122
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,149
-You will follow me.
-Yes, my lord.

123
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,610
You should serve His Majesty
for the time being.

124
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:51,653
Yes, Eunuch Kim.

125
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:13,049
So it begins.

126
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,610
Are you all right, Your Highness?

127
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,334
-Your Highness.
-What insolence is this?

128
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,594
Principal Director.

129
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:01,765
What is all the ruckus about?

130
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:06,186
I am here to convey
Her Royal Highness's final regard.

131
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,521
She seems to have startled herself

132
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,857
while attempting to avoid me
for some reason.

133
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,025
It is only natural.

134
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,194
Why would she welcome you?

135
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:17,781
Yet you are forcing her to receive you,
which must be why she is avoiding you.

136
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,240
I will leave after I give my regards.

137
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:20,408
Lord Park!

138
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:24,579
You are putting me

139
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,498
in a difficult spot.

140
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,626
If your impudence to Her Highness

141
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,795
becomes known to Prince Rui,

142
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:35,173
he will be infuriated.

143
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:43,890
I understand.

144
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,434
Then Vice Envoy Jung,

145
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,729
please give this back
to Her Highness yourself.

146
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,159
Your Highness.

147
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,500
Please allow me to apologize
on his behalf.

148
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,545
Please forgive him

149
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,005
for his discourteous behavior.

150
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:17,841
Thank you.

151
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:41,156
My lord.

152
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,740
What is going on?

153
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,082
What is the matter, Lord Park?

154
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,461
Please let me know
if this is something I should know.

155
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,130
There is no issue here.

156
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:59,924
You may return to your duty.

157
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,470
Yes, Lord Park.

158
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:08,892
My lord.

159
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:13,104
Your words convinced me
that she was substituted.

160
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,273
But that does not seem to be the case.

161
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,774
She is a substitute.

162
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,693
Were it not the case,

163
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:22,697
she would not have tried so hard
to hide her face.

164
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,782
However, Jung Je-pyo

165
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:27,869
saw Her Highness's visage.

166
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:30,288
I fell into my own trap.

167
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,707
The substitution must have taken place

168
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,293
before Jung Je-pyo
delivered the wedding gifts.

169
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,047
What will you do now?

170
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,423
I will report this to His Majesty

171
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:43,801
and punish those who replaced
the Princess with another woman.

172
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,138
But you were not able to see her face.

173
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:50,433
Would your case stand
without any evidence?

174
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,311
If <i>I </i>could not see her face,

175
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,730
that means no one else could.

176
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,777
So no one can confirm it

177
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,781
even if you insist
that a substitution took its place.

178
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,324
I am only reporting

179
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,827
to plant a seed of suspicion
in His Majesty's mind.

180
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:13,915
Once it takes its roots, it will grow
by absorbing the blood of others.

181
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:18,086
When the interrogation begins,
they will die whether they confess or not.

182
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:21,673
From Grand Prince Munseong,
Kim Myung-ha, to Kang Mong-woo.

183
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:25,176
Even if I interrogate
and execute all the nuisances,

184
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,805
no one would dare try to prove me wrong.

185
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:42,277
<i>Is there anything else I should know?</i>

186
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,822
<i>Do not leave anything out and tell me.</i>

187
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:50,159
Jung Je-pyo was granted an audience
with Her Highness by the Queen Dowager.

188
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,745
Bun-yeong had replaced her then.

189
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:56,124
Jung Je-pyo will not suspect Bun-yeong.

190
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:59,878
She understands
what is at stake in this matter.

191
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,756
She would not have shown her face
to the Principal Director.

192
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:05,675
<i>As such,</i>

193
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,721
<i>if the Principal Director
reports that he saw Bun-yeong himself,</i>

194
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,807
<i>he is deceiving you.</i>

195
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,185
Principal Director.

196
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,522
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,025
I am curious.

198
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:27,196
You said that you confirmed it yourself
at Byeokjegwan earlier today.

199
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,867
Does this mean
that you have seen the Princess,

200
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,910
I mean,

201
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,370
the court maid…

202
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,707
yourself?

203
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:42,962
I…

204
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,007
have not seen her face myself.

205
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,762
Jung Je-pyo found out
that she was not the Princess

206
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,556
and informed Podan.

207
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:57,060
How could he confirm that it was not her?

208
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,687
He has never even seen
the Princess's shadow.

209
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:05,360
Principal Director.

210
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,237
I apologize,

211
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:13,117
but I do not know
how Jung Je-pyo found out.

212
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:19,749
I have never heard you say
that you do not know.

213
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:24,629
I thought you knew the royal family
and the court's matter inside out.

214
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:26,839
Your Majesty.

215
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,593
How can I know everything?

216
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:32,679
Then I should summon someone who does.

217
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,639
Is anyone outside?

218
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,396
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

219
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,774
Summon Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

220
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:46,818
Yes, Your Majesty.

221
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:11,300
Tell me what you have seen and heard
about Jung Je-pyo.

222
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:16,222
While you were away from the palace
for your hunting trip,

223
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:18,099
I witnessed Vice Envoy Jung Je-pyo

224
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,643
enter Her Highness's quarters.

225
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:24,856
I later learned that he received
Her Royal Highness's approval

226
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,524
to greet Her Highness

227
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:29,360
and present her
with the bridal attire from Prince Rui.

228
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,488
Were you not aware, Principal Director?

229
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,324
I beg your pardon

230
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,078
for my negligence.

231
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:41,456
Thanks to Gidaeryeong Kang's testimony,

232
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,418
it is now certain that Jung Je-pyo
knows of the Princess's visage,

233
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:47,920
thus assuaging your suspicion.

234
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:50,173
Gidaeryeong Kang.

235
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,134
I am truly grateful.

236
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:58,765
Your Majesty, please excuse…

237
00:16:58,848 --> 00:16:59,932
Stop right there.

238
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,109
If Jung Je-pyo had realized

239
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:15,239
that the Princess was replaced
before Podan did,

240
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:19,160
he would not have informed Podan.

241
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,957
It would have been his prime opportunity
to impress Prince Rui, whom he serves.

242
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,044
Why would he inform Podan,
a man who serves the Emperor?

243
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:29,337
Do you not agree?

244
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:33,424
Your Majesty, forgive me for saying this,

245
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:34,509
but how shall I know

246
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:38,387
what Jung Je-pyo is thinking?

247
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:42,100
I have no choice then.
I will summon him and ask him myself.

248
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:43,476
Are you outside, Sang-hwa?

249
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,235
Your Majesty, did you call for me?

250
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:55,488
Head for Gaegyeong immediately
and bring Jung Je-pyo here.

251
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,950
If he refuses to come with you,

252
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:01,619
convey my message to Podan with respect.

253
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:02,620
Then…

254
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,872
he will send Jung Je-pyo to me.

255
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:05,957
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,916
Your Majesty.

257
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,919
Please wait.

258
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:11,838
I shall

259
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,800
answer the question you have asked me.

260
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,302
Please order the others to leave.

261
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,722
You may leave.

262
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,255
As you have trusted me
and confessed everything,

263
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,341
I shall trust you in return…

264
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,390
and not make this an issue.

265
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:13,896
Your report

266
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:15,814
is a lie.

267
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,649
It is not a lie.

268
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,029
I am certain of the Grand Prince
and Kim Myung-ha's crimes.

269
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,323
If you do not believe me,

270
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,660
please head to Gaegyeong this instant
and confirm it yourself.

271
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,037
If I head to Gaegyeong

272
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:35,042
and cause a controversy
that the Princess is an imposter,

273
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:40,339
I would be giving Prince Rui
a pretext to wage war against us.

274
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,884
It is a necessary sacrifice

275
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,387
to uncover the traitors' crimes.

276
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,974
Those words are utterly appalling!

277
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,521
Are you saying that you do not care
if another war occurs?

278
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:01,443
Our land will be ravaged
by the Qing cavalry

279
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:04,905
and our people will bleed to death,
slaughtered by their swords and spears.

280
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,365
Are you saying that is acceptable?

281
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,494
Of course not, Your Majesty.

282
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,665
However, my priority
is to maintain your reign

283
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,876
and punish all traitors.

284
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,670
Let me make this clear.

285
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:20,838
The Princess…

286
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,008
was not substituted.

287
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,429
I will consider your report unheard.

288
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:31,557
So do not…

289
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,978
mention this matter ever again.

290
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:39,314
Even if you silence me,

291
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,567
Prince Rui's ears are open.

292
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,112
If he learns of this incident,

293
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,867
I will assume that you have sent a spy
to Qing to inform him

294
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:54,204
and have you punished for high treason.

295
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:00,544
You may leave.

296
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:02,230
Sixth Royal Secretary.

297
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:03,690
His Majesty summons you.

298
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,959
Confess your crimes.

299
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:28,966
Your Majesty.

300
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:33,762
I am deeply grateful
to be given a chance to confess my crimes.

301
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,181
Captivated by my personal emotions,

302
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:39,476
I led the Grand Prince and the Princess
down the wrong road,

303
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:41,520
went against the royal command,

304
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,648
and disturbed the peace
between Joseon and the Qing.

305
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:46,858
I have also

306
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:49,736
endangered Your Majesty,
the court, and the people.

307
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:51,905
Furthermore,

308
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:56,159
I forsook your generosity
in forgiving my past crimes

309
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,371
and giving me a post at the court again.

310
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:04,084
My crimes are so great
that I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

311
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,669
You failed to mention a crime.

312
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:12,718
Despite committing those crimes,

313
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,262
you hid behind Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

314
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,269
I will not deny…

315
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,522
my crimes.

316
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,149
I will suffer whatever punishment,

317
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:28,942
Your Majesty.

318
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,570
You deserve to be executed
a thousand times over…

319
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:39,036
assuming that the report
of Princess's substitution is true.

320
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:48,712
As for me,

321
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,673
I have sent the Princess to Prince Rui,

322
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:56,136
and the peace between Joseon
and Qing is undisturbed.

323
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,596
So I shall not

324
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:00,265
hold you accountable for it.

325
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,687
Forgive my asking,

326
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,898
but may I assume

327
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:10,442
that this is your promise

328
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:13,278
that no harm will come to the Grand Prince

329
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:17,032
on account of my crimes?

330
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:18,408
There is no need for a promise.

331
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:19,534
If you are…

332
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:24,831
truly concerned about the Grand Prince,

333
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,835
see to it that such an event
never repeats itself.

334
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,045
Do you understand?

335
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:41,056
I am grateful for your generosity,
Your Majesty.

336
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,164
What is going on at this late hour?

337
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:12,921
Chief Royal Secretary,
His Majesty calls for you.

338
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,645
Gidaeryeong Kang has gone home.

339
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,532
I will warn you as the Captain
of the Special Firearms Unit.

340
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,200
From this point on,

341
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:46,663
it would be wise
for you to mind your actions.

342
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,309
I will entrust you with the task.

343
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,813
I shall carry out your order
with utmost sincerity.

344
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:31,583
Make sure that the word
regarding tonight's event

345
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,501
does not spread anywhere.

346
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:37,130
I will do my best,
so you will not be worried.

347
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,071
What you saw and heard
in the hall of governance tonight

348
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,823
shall not be shared with anyone.

349
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,452
If you get caught doing so,
your life will be forfeit.

350
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:10,163
Do not worry.

351
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:12,958
I will make sure that the palace eunuchs,
adjunct overseers,

352
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:15,585
and servants of the court
do not speak of this.

353
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:20,257
What I am worried about
is your life, Eunuch Kim.

354
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,309
Did you think I was unaware of your
correspondence with the Queen Dowager?

355
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,689
Mark my words.

356
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:38,275
Do you understand?

357
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:42,570
I understand.

358
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:57,919
What happened?

359
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,130
The Principal Director has returned home

360
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:02,299
and His Majesty is still
at the hall of governance.

361
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:03,300
What about Eunuch Kim?

362
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,094
He only said
it was no different than usual

363
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:07,971
and that there was nothing to report.

364
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,644
Was the Principal Director's concern
a misunderstanding?

365
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,649
What on earth is going on?

366
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:24,904
Summon Senior Court Lady Dong.

367
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:26,239
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

368
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:32,746
Inform her
that I will not answer her summons.

369
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,915
You must have lost your mind.

370
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,084
How dare you refuse
Her Royal Highness's order?

371
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:46,217
Mind your words.

372
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:50,472
I am a court lady who has received
private quarters from His Majesty.

373
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:55,935
If you know what it means to be grateful,
you should accept her calling.

374
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:03,401
That is the very reason
why I have refused.

375
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,155
If I get caught by Captain Joo

376
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:10,408
while taking orders
from Her Royal Highness

377
00:29:11,076 --> 00:29:12,827
and the news reaches His Majesty,

378
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,455
would that not be a bigger problem?

379
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,003
That is the current situation.

380
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,672
Who knows what will happen

381
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:25,548
in the future?

382
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,351
Convey these words.

383
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:38,228
I am no longer

384
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:41,106
the Senior Court Lady Dong

385
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:44,859
who put her life at risk
for mere words of promise.

386
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:48,029
If she wishes to use me,

387
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,825
she must give me something in return.

388
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,294
Did that arrogant wench
truly say those words?

389
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:06,089
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

390
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:19,477
Your Royal Highness.

391
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:22,564
It is better
than asking for nothing in return.

392
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:27,861
I thought she was a fool,

393
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:31,322
but she just may come in handy.

394
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,081
Your Majesty.

395
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:42,125
You do not seem well.

396
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,922
Did something happen
in the hall of governance today?

397
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:52,051
Why do you ask?

398
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,849
Did the Queen Dowager
order you to gauge my mood?

399
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,604
Ordinarily,

400
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:06,357
you have trouble sleeping
when you are even slightly distressed.

401
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:09,694
I was only asking out of concern.

402
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:12,906
You are right.

403
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,409
I do not think
I will get a good night's sleep tonight.

404
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:18,828
Shall I prepare some warm tea?

405
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:19,913
Yes.

406
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:44,729
<i>If Prince Rui learns of this incident,</i>

407
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:49,526
I will assume that you have sent a spy
to Qing to inform him

408
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,279
<i>and have you punished for high treason.</i>

409
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:58,159
Kang Mong-woo
must have persuaded His Majesty

410
00:31:58,243 --> 00:31:59,744
to cover up the matter.

411
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:03,998
I am certain he came up with the idea
to replace the Princess.

412
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:06,918
Continue to speak.

413
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:09,796
I shall find evidence

414
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,509
that Kang Mong-woo
and Kim Myung-ha joined hands

415
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,969
to plot this incident.

416
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:18,137
That matter is already in the past.

417
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,432
We need a new crime
to report to His Majesty.

418
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,142
Something like

419
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:26,855
conspiring against the king, per se.

420
00:32:30,441 --> 00:32:31,734
Please leave it to me,

421
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:34,112
my lord.

422
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:47,417
<i>Everything almost fell apart.</i>

423
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:49,878
However,

424
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:55,675
the King trusted your words

425
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:58,469
and covered up the report
from Park Jong-hwan, his own man.

426
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,097
I cannot believe it.

427
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,143
I was lucky that the Principal Director
made a mistake.

428
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:12,525
They will keep a closer watch
on you and the Sixth Royal Secretary.

429
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,028
From now on,

430
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:17,906
I will meet him outside in your stead.

431
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:23,953
Is Her Highness safe and sound?

432
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:29,125
Se-dong and Jeomine escorted her safely
to the hideout outside the capital.

433
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,501
Upon daybreak,

434
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,670
they will head to Master Choam's house.

435
00:33:33,296 --> 00:33:36,633
Her Highness will head to a place
of the King's choosing.

436
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:40,720
Where might that be?

437
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,254
I am here to escort Your Highness
upon His Majesty's orders.

438
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,924
Where are you taking me?

439
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:22,428
His Majesty has specially commanded me
to ensure your well-being.

440
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:25,932
We are going to a safe place,
so please do not worry.

441
00:34:57,338 --> 00:34:58,881
I have a royal command for you.

442
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:08,516
Should rumors about Her Highness
spread in the capital,

443
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,978
you can consider your lives forfeit.

444
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:14,188
Do you understand?

445
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:16,274
Of course, my lord.

446
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,026
I will not speak a word.

447
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:22,280
Here, take this.

448
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,283
His Majesty has bestowed this upon you.

449
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,750
All right, let us go.

450
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:47,013
I am not sure
if we should let her go like this.

451
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,598
What do you mean?

452
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:51,184
Think about the rumors of poisoning.

453
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:54,187
I am just worried
for Her Highness's safety.

454
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,731
Come on now. That is just a rumor.

455
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,901
-What?
-And do you not know Lady Hee-soo?

456
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:03,488
Do you think she would
place Her Highness in danger?

457
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,823
That is true.

458
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:12,497
-My goodness.
-Are you not coming?

459
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,792
Wait for me!

460
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:18,127
Wait for me!

461
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,504
Goodness, look!

462
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:23,216
Your Highness, the <i>gidaeryeong </i>is here.

463
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,106
Greetings, Master.

464
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,609
You look unwell, Your Highness.

465
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:46,447
He has not slept a wink
crying over the Princess.

466
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,990
That is not true.

467
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,284
Believe me.

468
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:53,704
Your Highness.

469
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:55,665
I really did not cry because of that.

470
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:01,087
Here comes His Majesty!

471
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:10,346
Your Majesty.

472
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:16,894
I was hoping to play <i>baduk </i>with you
instead of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

473
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,689
What do you say, Grand Prince?

474
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:28,072
It would be my honor.

475
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,666
You do not have to follow us.

476
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,585
Return to your post and await my orders.

477
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,005
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:01,147
You have improved very much.

479
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:04,901
I merely followed
the teachings of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

480
00:38:06,027 --> 00:38:09,155
What do you think is the duty of the king?

481
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,577
It is to govern his people well.

482
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,078
You are right.

483
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:20,208
It is to help them live
without any concerns.

484
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:22,585
To that end,

485
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,046
what should one be wary of?

486
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:28,883
One should be wary of a war.

487
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,426
Correct.

488
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:33,554
Preventing war ahead of time.

489
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,682
That is the king's most important duty.

490
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,101
It is because the people suffer

491
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:42,355
even if the nation wins the war.

492
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:46,025
Do you understand

493
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:49,820
why I am telling you this?

494
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,952
My sister is not at fault.

495
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:58,412
I plotted everything.

496
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,754
Did sending the Princess to the Qing
make you feel wronged and resentful?

497
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:11,092
The fact that I had no power to help her
when she had been my devoted caretaker

498
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:13,928
agonized me

499
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:17,139
and made me feel terrible.

500
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:25,773
Do you think…

501
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:30,444
I would not understand
the agony that you two feel?

502
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,532
She told me

503
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,202
that you were once taken
as the Qing's captive

504
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:41,789
on behalf of my late father.

505
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,210
That was why my heart ached even more

506
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,505
as I knew I was deceiving you.

507
00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:56,262
I am glad you have learned a lesson.

508
00:39:57,638 --> 00:40:00,016
Mark this incident in your heart

509
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,144
and do not ever forget it.

510
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:06,314
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:07,940
I will keep your words in mind.

512
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,534
Your Majesty, shall I escort you
back to your quarters?

513
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:23,372
Your Majesty.

514
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:25,541
Shall we head to Yeongchwijeong?

515
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:06,874
Please tell me
where you have taken Her Highness.

516
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:08,501
I do not know what you are saying.

517
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:09,585
My lord.

518
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,089
Do you wish to be executed?

519
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:17,385
Do not ask and do not seek to know.

520
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:20,054
It is His Majesty's orders.

521
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:28,521
It seems you have absolutely no trust
in His Majesty.

522
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:37,696
Why do you think
His Majesty gave you, a traitor's son,

523
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,198
a position at the court

524
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:41,659
despite the objection
from the Principal Director?

525
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:45,287
I do not know.

526
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,249
Do you?

527
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,420
It was because you risked
the court's disapproval

528
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:54,380
to stand by the people

529
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:59,802
despite the precarious position
that you were in yourself.

530
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:05,307
I must dare to say

531
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,561
that I find your words hard to believe.

532
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:12,606
You simply do not wish to believe them.

533
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,090
The Principal Director has summoned you.

534
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,887
Where is he?

535
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:15,252
I appreciate your assistance
earlier at the hall of governance.

536
00:43:16,629 --> 00:43:19,089
I almost committed a serious crime
against His Majesty,

537
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,009
but I averted it thanks to you.

538
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:24,178
I am flattered.

539
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,347
Only a few seemed to know
that you are the <i>baduk </i>gambler

540
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,057
from three years ago.

541
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,768
It is not something to boast about.

542
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:34,188
I was going to spare your life back then,

543
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:36,398
but His Majesty insisted otherwise.

544
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:42,947
He said you were a necessary sacrifice
for his ascension to the throne.

545
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:48,118
He is quite impressive
but at the same time, terrifying.

546
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:56,919
For what reason are you telling me this?

547
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:02,591
Do you know Lord Kang Hang-soon
by any chance?

548
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:09,139
Though His Majesty
regarded him as his master,

549
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,307
even he was abandoned.

550
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,018
The same applies to you.

551
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:14,186
His Majesty is someone

552
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,898
who easily abandons his subjects
after taking advantage of their loyalty.

553
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:19,483
Do not forget that.

554
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,186
Watch where you are going.

555
00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:15,056
<i>They are there, just not noticeable.</i>

556
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,391
Look closely.

557
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,977
Ten steps away. Now, fifty steps away.

558
00:45:19,644 --> 00:45:20,854
Now, 100 steps away.

559
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:23,106
My men are on duty
while keeping their distance.

560
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:06,691
You should be careful.

561
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:11,613
What had you so deep in thought
that you did not notice me following you?

562
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:27,128
Tell me about Bun-yeong.

563
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:31,341
She lost her parents during the war

564
00:46:31,424 --> 00:46:34,177
and was raised by her stepparents
before entering the palace.

565
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:37,514
As she is bright and respectful,

566
00:46:37,597 --> 00:46:40,058
she will easily adapt
to the Qing royal family.

567
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:43,269
I made arrangements to have the Princess
looked after while in Beijing.

568
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:44,396
The caretaker

569
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:47,524
will look after Bun-yeong as well.

570
00:46:49,192 --> 00:46:50,902
Is that person trustworthy?

571
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,700
I trust them more than myself.

572
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:05,333
The king should be protecting his people,
but the people are protecting the king.

573
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:07,961
I am reminded again

574
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:11,715
that a nation and its king
cannot exist without the people.

575
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:18,471
I thought you were angry at me.

576
00:47:20,056 --> 00:47:21,850
I am indeed angry.

577
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,436
However, my anger is not directed at you…

578
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:27,981
but at myself.

579
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:33,194
I repeatedly pondered over your words
that you helped the Princess

580
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:35,488
because of the pain you suffered
three years ago.

581
00:47:36,406 --> 00:47:38,616
Not only did I make you suffer
despite your innocence,

582
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,077
but I also made you suffer
the same pain again.

583
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:45,957
I could not hold back the anger
I felt toward myself.

584
00:47:49,294 --> 00:47:50,336
Your Majesty.

585
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:52,881
Are you implying

586
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:57,886
that you believe my words
that I did not falsely attest back then?

587
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:00,388
Did you not say three years ago

588
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:02,640
that you had not given
any attestations about me,

589
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:06,060
be it true or false?

590
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:07,061
I have never…

591
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:11,357
doubted those words.

592
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,028
But why did you…

593
00:48:17,614 --> 00:48:18,656
<i>A king</i>

594
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:21,409
only has his subjects
and political enemies.

595
00:48:23,912 --> 00:48:25,455
He keeps no such thing as friends.

596
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:29,959
He said you were a necessary sacrifice
for his ascension to the throne.

597
00:48:30,752 --> 00:48:34,547
<i>He is quite impressive
but at the same time, terrifying.</i>

598
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,598
I do not know what to think of your words.

599
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:48,269
In this moment,

600
00:48:51,314 --> 00:48:52,607
I sit before you

601
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,194
as an ordinary man who loves a woman
and not as the king of this nation.

602
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,826
I have made you suffer

603
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:05,787
and I understand
that pain is still lingering.

604
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,830
I know…

605
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:10,375
that you have returned to me

606
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:13,670
because of that very pain.

607
00:49:15,797 --> 00:49:16,881
I hope…

608
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:24,430
a day will come when I can tell you
about all the past events in honesty.

609
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:28,226
But in the end,
what I offer would only be excuses.

610
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,480
I am aware that I do not deserve

611
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:34,357
your forgiveness.

612
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:43,283
What do you wish to hear from me?

613
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:50,206
I will be the king
until the end of my days.

614
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:55,461
I cannot dare to neglect this great duty
that I must uphold.

615
00:49:55,545 --> 00:49:56,379
That is why…

616
00:50:01,384 --> 00:50:03,219
I may end up

617
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:05,555
causing you

618
00:50:06,347 --> 00:50:07,849
pain again.

619
00:50:13,521 --> 00:50:15,398
Do you still wish to stay by my side?

620
00:51:04,405 --> 00:51:07,492
<i>I will wait patiently
and not press for your answer.</i>

621
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,453
<i>When you have made up your mind,</i>

622
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,331
come to Yeongchwijeong.

623
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:46,280
Since when have you been tailing me?

624
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:50,827
I went to escort you home
as I was worried.

625
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:02,964
Mong-woo.

626
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:10,638
It looked like you had been swaying
since that day.

627
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,227
I have misread the situation, have I not?

628
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:20,857
-My lady.
-I cannot believe

629
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,233
that I am thinking this way.

630
00:52:24,694 --> 00:52:25,987
But I wonder

631
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,283
if the King perhaps
has his reasons I am not aware of.

632
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:36,164
You are well aware
that it is the King's tactic.

633
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:39,876
I trusted the King once,
but I was sold to the Qing.

634
00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:41,753
Your father was taken
to the Qing in his stead

635
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:43,921
as he was also deceived by such tactics.

636
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:46,841
How are you so certain

637
00:52:47,383 --> 00:52:49,552
that it was the King
who sold you off back then?

638
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:53,723
The Qing official
who plucked my eye out kindly told me.

639
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:56,893
He said if I confessed
my visitation to the Ming,

640
00:52:57,477 --> 00:53:00,313
the Qing Emperor
would summon the late king

641
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:04,692
and have his brother, Grand Prince Jinhan,
ascend the throne.

642
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:09,155
Those were the Qing Emperor's words.

643
00:53:09,822 --> 00:53:11,824
That does not prove
that the King was the spy then.

644
00:53:15,912 --> 00:53:17,497
Then how about this?

645
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:21,751
The King executed Lord Kim Jong-bae,
who accused him as a spy

646
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:26,798
and punished you for false attestation
and silenced the spy incident.

647
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:31,135
The person who rose to the highest place
from the most dangerous one.

648
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:34,889
That person must be the spy.

649
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:37,892
Am I wrong?

650
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:43,064
Seeing as you cannot answer,

651
00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:45,483
I shall have my way.

652
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:48,736
If you assassinate the King,

653
00:53:49,862 --> 00:53:52,448
Principal Director Park
will choose a king to his taste

654
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:56,160
and the plans we seek to achieve
will not be able to see light.

655
00:53:57,328 --> 00:53:58,746
Is that the kind of revenge

656
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:01,374
you seek?

657
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:04,669
The kind of revenge I seek

658
00:54:05,962 --> 00:54:07,463
is the death of my sworn enemy.

659
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:14,554
I will let you know when it is time.

660
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:17,557
You can have your way then.

661
00:54:22,728 --> 00:54:24,480
Can I believe in your words?

662
00:54:25,857 --> 00:54:28,359
Have I ever forsaken a promise?

663
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:35,825
A word from Master Choam
arrived this afternoon.

664
00:54:36,534 --> 00:54:39,579
He received an official appointment letter
as the Inspector General.

665
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:42,331
He will arrive at the capital at daybreak.

666
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,353
Greetings, Your Majesty.

667
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:06,647
Kim Je-nam at your service.

668
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:09,275
Welcome.

669
00:55:09,775 --> 00:55:11,194
Now that I see you in court,

670
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:16,115
I cannot contain my joy.

671
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:20,578
I promise to do my utmost
to advise you to the best of my ability

672
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:22,580
and combat the evils of the court

673
00:55:23,164 --> 00:55:27,126
to establish discipline and order.

674
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:31,714
From this point on,
I will see through your eyes,

675
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:33,841
listen through your ears,

676
00:55:34,592 --> 00:55:38,804
and engrave every word of your advice

677
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,390
deep in my heart.

678
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:00,534
<i>Why does it have to be Kim Je-nam?</i>

679
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:03,579
If he needed someone
who lived a secluded life,

680
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:06,457
I am sure you could have recommended
other more suitable talents.

681
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,085
His Majesty appointed him to his post

682
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:11,254
without asking for
the court's recommendations.

683
00:56:11,879 --> 00:56:15,508
Who could dare to oppose him?

684
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:18,427
Please do not be so concerned.

685
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:22,556
As he is a stickler for integrity,
he has no faction to speak of

686
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,892
and would not even consider forming one.

687
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:28,479
He will seek a dismissal soon enough.

688
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:30,481
What about Princess Jangryeong's incident?

689
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,235
Are you planning

690
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:38,281
to let this pass by
without telling me anything?

691
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:42,326
The matters I do not inform you of

692
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:44,912
are matters you do not need to know.

693
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:48,040
To maintain the bond
between you and His Majesty

694
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:49,834
as a mother and son,

695
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,295
that is for the best.

696
00:56:58,009 --> 00:56:58,968
Now,

697
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:03,014
the only remaining task
is to find a spouse for the Grand Prince.

698
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:04,932
I have already found an ideal partner.

699
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:07,059
I will have them greet you soon.

700
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:10,104
I think we should look for
a new queen as well.

701
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:14,400
Is the Queen's illness

702
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,278
that serious?

703
00:57:17,862 --> 00:57:19,071
For the past few days,

704
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:21,991
she has not even come to greet me.

705
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:41,302
Your Majesty!

706
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:42,595
Are you all right?

707
00:57:45,222 --> 00:57:46,182
Your Majesty!

708
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:01,113
Your Majesty.

709
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:04,659
I will visit more often.

710
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:08,454
Please recover soon.

711
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:25,638
<i>Your Majesty, the</i> gidaeryeong<i> is here.</i>

712
00:58:27,056 --> 00:58:29,975
Your Majesty, have you summoned me?

713
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:32,603
Gidaeryeong Kang.

714
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:39,735
Are you startled to see
how weak my illness has made me?

715
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:44,990
I was planning to see you
after recovering,

716
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:50,204
but I have summoned you
as I do not think I can recover.

717
00:58:52,915 --> 00:58:54,041
Your Majesty.

718
00:58:58,796 --> 00:58:59,964
Grand Prince Munseong

719
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:03,217
visits me several times a day.

720
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:07,972
He tries his best
to put on a smile to console me,

721
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,559
but the apparent loneliness
in his young face

722
00:59:13,352 --> 00:59:15,104
makes my heart ache for him.

723
00:59:18,774 --> 00:59:20,693
Before I die,

724
00:59:21,652 --> 00:59:23,821
I wish to be of support
to the Grand Prince.

725
00:59:25,364 --> 00:59:27,241
Is there any way I could?

726
00:59:34,623 --> 00:59:36,083
There is a way,

727
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,878
but it is difficult to achieve.

728
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:43,883
Moreover, if things go wrong,
you and the Grand Prince may be in danger.

729
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:47,052
As such, I am hesitant to share this.

730
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:50,681
Please do not hesitate and tell me.

731
00:59:51,307 --> 00:59:54,435
If it is within my power, I will do it.

732
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:07,323
The only way to protect His Highness…

733
01:00:15,664 --> 01:00:17,666
is to have him appointed
as the Crown Prince.

734
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:25,216
If he fails to become one,

735
01:00:27,092 --> 01:00:28,594
he will…

736
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,973
leave this world before you do,
Your Majesty.

737
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:03,337
My lady.

738
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:05,714
It is late.

739
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:08,884
You should come in.

740
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:14,056
Jageunnyeon.

741
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:15,891
Yes, my lady.

742
01:01:17,852 --> 01:01:19,603
As Master Choam has arrived,

743
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:22,481
we should go on an outing.

744
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:25,401
An outing?

745
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,008
Master Choam.

746
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:50,718
Welcome.

747
01:01:51,302 --> 01:01:52,303
Give us a minute.

748
01:02:10,696 --> 01:02:12,323
Can you take back a move?

749
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:13,574
Please give up.

750
01:02:14,575 --> 01:02:17,661
Taking back one move
will not win you the game.

751
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:22,124
I lose.

752
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,959
Do not be disappointed.

753
01:02:24,043 --> 01:02:27,713
You have improved very much.

754
01:02:28,297 --> 01:02:29,131
Is that so?

755
01:02:35,095 --> 01:02:37,473
All right. I should get going then.

756
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:40,225
Already?

757
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:41,226
But Master Choam.

758
01:02:41,936 --> 01:02:44,021
I thought you returned
to aid Lady Hee-soo.

759
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:45,773
That was my intention

760
01:02:46,273 --> 01:02:48,984
until His Majesty
appointed me Inspector General.

761
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:55,407
I cannot join hands with you.

762
01:02:55,991 --> 01:02:59,536
You are well aware
that I do not possess the talent

763
01:03:00,955 --> 01:03:03,123
of working for different parties
simultaneously.

764
01:03:12,424 --> 01:03:13,676
You seem composed

765
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:16,971
as if you had already known

766
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:19,098
that I would back out.

767
01:03:19,723 --> 01:03:22,309
I considered the possibility

768
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,438
upon hearing the news
that you were appointed Inspector General.

769
01:03:26,522 --> 01:03:29,483
This is why I can never beat you.

770
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:37,282
As you have met the King,
may I ask your opinion on him?

771
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:46,125
I think you would know him better than me.

772
01:03:47,459 --> 01:03:48,669
Please tell me.

773
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,588
He seemed more resolute

774
01:03:52,256 --> 01:03:54,049
than I had thought,

775
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:57,344
but softer than you think.

776
01:03:59,596 --> 01:04:00,848
What do you mean?

777
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:06,061
I expected him to be a mere puppet
of Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

778
01:04:07,187 --> 01:04:08,856
But I do not think that is the case.

779
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:11,984
For a tyrant who supposedly
succumbed to temptations

780
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,861
and stole his young nephew's throne,

781
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,281
his eyes seemed far too clear.

782
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:20,409
In any case,

783
01:04:20,492 --> 01:04:22,119
whether I live or die,

784
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,789
I want to know
what kind of man His Majesty is.

785
01:04:39,928 --> 01:04:42,181
I was joyful
that he became the Inspector General.

786
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:45,309
I did not expect him to act thusly.

787
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:47,436
What will you do now?

788
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:49,438
We do not have the power
to dethrone the King,

789
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:51,565
and the Grand Prince is still at risk.

790
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:54,777
Do not worry.

791
01:04:56,195 --> 01:04:58,280
Before the year passes,

792
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:01,200
His Highness
will be appointed Crown Prince.

793
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:03,368
What do you mean?

794
01:05:03,452 --> 01:05:06,872
Regardless of the King's reason
behind Master Choam's appointment,

795
01:05:06,955 --> 01:05:08,999
his appointment alone is enough

796
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,335
to intimidate
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan.

797
01:05:11,919 --> 01:05:13,796
When he seeks to claim all the power

798
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:17,549
he has so far shared with the Great Lord
and the Minister of War,

799
01:05:19,426 --> 01:05:20,511
that moment

800
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:23,347
will be our window of opportunity.

801
01:05:48,455 --> 01:05:50,374
<i>What do you wish to hear from me?</i>

802
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:53,418
I will be the king
until the end of my day.

803
01:05:54,962 --> 01:05:57,422
I cannot dare to neglect this great duty

804
01:05:58,382 --> 01:05:59,883
that I must uphold.

805
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:00,801
That is why…

806
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:03,804
I may end up

807
01:06:05,264 --> 01:06:06,348
causing you

808
01:06:07,057 --> 01:06:08,559
pain again.

809
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:13,147
Do you still wish to stay by my side?

810
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:26,762
Your Majesty.

811
01:07:28,096 --> 01:07:30,432
I am here to answer your question.

812
01:07:47,658 --> 01:07:50,911
I will endure any sufferings
that may follow.

813
01:07:53,497 --> 01:07:55,249
I will stay by your side.

814
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,672
Your Majesty!

815
01:09:25,756 --> 01:09:27,090
There is trouble.

816
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:29,301
Lightning struck the palace
and started a fire.

817
01:09:33,764 --> 01:09:34,806
Where?

818
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:37,267
Where did the fire start?

819
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:04,450

820
01:10:25,315 --> 01:10:28,276
CAPTIVATING THE KING

821
01:10:28,902 --> 01:10:32,489
You know who poisoned
my brother to death, do you not?

822
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:34,574
<i>I will have the two wings
the Principal Director abandoned</i>

823
01:10:34,658 --> 01:10:36,576
become Grand Prince Munseong's wings

824
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:40,038
and have him become the Crown Prince,
His Majesty's heir.

825
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:42,874
That can only happen

826
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,501
over my dead body.

827
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:46,253
The appointment of the Crown Prince

828
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:50,215
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

829
01:10:50,715 --> 01:10:54,094
Let the King enter first
and come in a moment later.

830
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:56,513
<i>I am clueless</i>

831
01:10:57,472 --> 01:10:59,433
<i>as to what to do with my feelings.</i>
