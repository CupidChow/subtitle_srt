CAPTIVATING THE KING

ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,408
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

PRODUCTION GUIDELINES WERE STRICTLY

EPISODE 13

6
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:30,962
What is the matter?

7
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:43,766
You are trembling. What is wrong?

8
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,190
You cannot…

9
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:56,904
go inside.

10
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,497
Do you have another lover waiting inside?

11
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:14,213
Or…

12
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:20,970
is there an assassin hiding to kill me?

13
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,111
Since when have you caught on?

14
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:48,664
Why did you come…

15
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,169
when you knew everything?

16
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:54,629
Did I not promise…

17
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,467
that I shall

18
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,054
come running at your call?

19
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,543
Mong-woo.

20
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,213
Mong-woo!

21
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,139
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

22
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:49,016
Mong-woo.

23
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:51,102
My lady.

24
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:53,604
My lady!

25
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,608
No, Mong-woo.

26
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,820
"My lady"?

27
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,780
Mong-woo…

28
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,826
No, please.

29
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:09,787
You have to stay awake.

30
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:11,122
Mong-woo.

31
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,208
Mong-woo.

32
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:19,589
Mong-woo.

33
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:47,742
Your Majesty,
we are prepared to return to the palace.

34
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:48,743
Please give us your order.

35
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:50,870
Mong-woo's wound seems grave.

36
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,538
Bring Royal Physician Ji
and a female physician.

37
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,373
Your safety comes first.

38
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:57,752
Kang Mong-woo will be treated
after being taken to the State Tribunal.

39
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:00,671
- Let us return first.
- Mong-woo comes first.

40
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,132
This woman committed high treason.

41
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:11,557
Mong-woo took the knife…

42
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,644
to save my life.

43
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:18,147
It is clear that she is in league
with the assassin.

44
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:21,067
And their assassination attempt
simply failed.

45
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,662
- Your Majesty.
- I have already given my command.

46
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,624
- Bring the royal physician.
- Your Majesty.

47
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,290
Follow the royal command!

48
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:41,837
I shall, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,024
If I lose you like this,

50
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,320
I shall never

51
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,573
forgive myself.

52
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,081
His Majesty's return to the palace
has been delayed.

53
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,251
Not a single soul may enter the premises.

54
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,212
So examine the vicinity thoroughly
and stay extra vigilant.

55
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,006
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

56
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:31,220
Shall I transfer the criminal
in the storage to the State Tribunal?

57
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,680
Not yet.

58
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,557
Keep him there until there is an order

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,183
and do not take your eyes off him.

60
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,226
Yes, Captain.

61
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:39,395
You two will follow me.

62
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:40,896
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

63
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,155
The scent is pleasant.

64
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,076
You may drink too, Senior Court Lady Dong.

65
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,372
Please forgive my bluntness,

66
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:01,500
but His Majesty
may return to the palace anytime.

67
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:05,004
Please address the reason
behind your summon.

68
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,307
The empty queen's quarters

69
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,852
will soon welcome a new occupant.

70
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:23,564
The concubine appointment
would be within the new queen's purview,

71
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,567
but I shall put in a good word for you.

72
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:37,411
- How dare you?
- It is fine.

73
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,876
Why do you laugh?

74
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,463
I only laugh as I am reminded
of a past incident.

75
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,340
A past incident?

76
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,883
Long ago,

77
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,220
before His Majesty ascended to the throne

78
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,389
and I was a court maid in your service,

79
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:59,892
you gave me a command

80
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:03,229
when the late king
summoned me out of the blue.

81
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,399
Your Royal Highness.

82
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,485
Please do not send me
to His Majesty's quarters.

83
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:10,945
I would rather

84
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,656
you took my life this instant.

85
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,703
I hear you harbor affection
for Grand Prince Jinhan.

86
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,049
If you truly care for him,

87
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:34,927
become the King's woman.

88
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,349
Become the sword
that protects Grand Prince Jinhan.

89
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:44,353
<i>Upon hearing those words,</i>

90
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,815
my tender young soul
was shaken and terrified.

91
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,109
Whenever I recall that moment,

92
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,987
my heart still races
and I break out into a cold sweat.

93
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,781
And why are you bringing that up?

94
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,410
When lightning struck the palace,

95
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:03,164
His Majesty questioned me thusly.

96
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,420
"You know who poisoned
the late king to death,

97
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,007
do you not?"

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,853
You said you would put in a good word
for my appointment as a concubine.

99
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:30,566
I will be looking forward to it,
Your Royal Highness.

100
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,416
That insolent wench.

101
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,174
Do mind where you are!

102
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,301
Has His Majesty returned?

103
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,053
Not yet.

104
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,556
Come.

105
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:46,308
When he does,

106
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,102
I shall send you word immediately.

107
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:49,520
So please wait in your quarters.

108
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,522
How about Captain Joo?

109
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,691
How would he have returned

110
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,193
without His Majesty?

111
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:03,617
What is going on?

112
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:06,495
Did something happen

113
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,540
to His Majesty?

114
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,424
Wait here.

115
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:20,843
Follow me.

116
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:31,729
An attempt was made here

117
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,399
to assassinate His Majesty tonight.

118
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:37,860
Is His Majesty

119
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,946
the man who lost his consciousness

120
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:43,866
from a wound?

121
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,910
The one who was wounded

122
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,829
is a woman.

123
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:52,333
Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo.

124
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,962
She seems to be
associated with the assassin.

125
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,512
Should you learn anything about her
during your treatment,

126
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:08,849
report every little detail back to me.

127
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,143
Do you understand?

128
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,023
Yes, Captain.

129
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:32,414
How is she?

130
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,293
Thankfully, it is not a fatal wound,

131
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,295
but it is deep.

132
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,298
She is running a fever,
the bleeding has not stopped yet,

133
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,175
and her body seems too weak.

134
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,094
Take her pulse.

135
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:55,604
Her pulse is very faint and beating fast.

136
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,272
Is she in a critical condition?

137
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:01,735
Suffering a wound in her weakened state
seems to have affected her deeply.

138
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,445
We shall stop the bleeding first.

139
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:06,698
As we must wash the wound
with salt water and apply ointment,

140
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:10,744
I must dare ask
that you give us some privacy.

141
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:29,638
- How is she?
- We have stopped the bleeding.

142
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,433
However, I am concerned about her fever.

143
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:35,185
We shall have to see
if she can last the night.

144
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,068
Your Majesty.

145
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:44,903
I await your punishment for my crimes.

146
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,699
Are you referring to…

147
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,204
your false report regarding her treatment
on the night of the <i>gisinje</i>?

148
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,832
I have committed a greater crime.

149
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,293
What is it?

150
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,921
I only reported to you falsely back then

151
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,340
as an old acquaintance
who did me a great favor long ago

152
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:08,343
made a special request
that I look after the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

153
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,889
I only sought
to repay his kindness back then.

154
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:14,850
I never suspected that he was in league
with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,

155
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:18,645
much less foresaw his return to the court
as the Inspector General.

156
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:22,816
What did Kim Je-nam…

157
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,237
say about his relationship
with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>?

158
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,699
He said she was the family
of a friend he considers as his brother.

159
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:36,079
Your confession now
equates to a confession of treason.

160
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:39,249
Can you swear
that there is no deceit in your words?

161
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,252
As you can question
the Inspector General for the truth,

162
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,922
there is no reason
for me to falsely confess.

163
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:47,925
Your Majesty, if his words are true,

164
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:49,760
you cannot let this slide.

165
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:51,553
Summon Kim Je-nam.

166
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

167
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,035
Please follow me inside.

168
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,548
Royal Physician Ji Nam-kyu

169
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:30,759
only reported the truth, Your Majesty.

170
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,679
Please ask me any questions you may have,

171
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,097
and I shall answer them.

172
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,392
Were you aware of…

173
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:45,023
the <i>gidaeryeong</i>'s designs for me?

174
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:46,942
Of course, Your Majesty.

175
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:52,030
Three years ago,
she came to me in a wretched state.

176
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:53,907
As soon as she recovered,

177
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,244
she confessed
that she had a plan for treason

178
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,038
and requested my assistance.

179
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,917
Do your views

180
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:07,170
align with the <i>gidaeryeong</i>'s?

181
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:08,255
Your Majesty.

182
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,216
It shames me to admit this,

183
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,053
but I do not have
a spirit of justice like her.

184
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:18,265
Before I received
your summon to the court,

185
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:21,935
I used to believe that I would be content
living all my days in the countryside.

186
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,896
While I found her spirit admirable,

187
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,108
I was sure of her failure

188
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,444
and only hoped for her safety.

189
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:31,528
Your Majesty.

190
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,698
Do not let him trick you
with his wicked words.

191
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,367
Why did you not report the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

192
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,203
even after being appointed
as the Inspector General?

193
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:44,207
Was it not to plot treason with her?

194
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,502
It is only natural for you
to have suspicion against me.

195
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,839
I, too, had a few against you,
Your Majesty.

196
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:55,552
I questioned your decision
to summon an unruly sword like me.

197
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:59,556
I assumed you were trying
to mimic acts of virtuous kings

198
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:02,559
to allay the concerns of the people.

199
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,687
However, upon meeting you,

200
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,689
my suspicion melted away like spring snow

201
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,608
and was instead replaced by hope

202
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,362
that I could contribute
to this nation and its people.

203
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:17,157
As such, I went to the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
and conveyed my change of heart.

204
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,036
Ever since then,
I have never had private meetings with her

205
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,871
nor have we exchanged words.

206
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:24,414
Your Majesty.

207
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:27,209
His words are nothing but crude excuses.

208
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,170
He sat back and watched the treason unfold
when he could have prevented it.

209
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,881
It is only right
to punish him for high treason.

210
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,467
I do not intend to avoid any punishment.

211
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:39,554
I prepared myself for death
when I was summoned here.

212
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:44,810
However,

213
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,771
should the <i>gidaeryeong</i>
survive and come to,

214
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:50,816
please be generous

215
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,652
and hearken to her reasoning.

216
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:59,324
Please contemplate
what would have driven her

217
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,202
to come before you

218
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,914
even in her weakened state.

219
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,252
I earnestly plead with you

220
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,296
for the sake of this nation
and its people.

221
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,793
I believe you.

222
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,091
I also

223
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,304
wish to hear her out…

224
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:06,641
so long as she wakes up.

225
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:09,770
Thank you for your generosity,
Your Majesty.

226
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,689
The master of this house

227
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:15,317
would also rejoice in the Underworld

228
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,988
to have his only kin
spared from being executed as a traitor.

229
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,371
What did you just say?

230
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:29,831
His only kin?

231
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,626
Are you saying…

232
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,047
Mong-woo is my Master Kang's kin?

233
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:11,129
Master Choam.

234
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:16,008
Stand back.

235
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,762
What about Lady Hee-soo?

236
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,181
Seeing as you are here,

237
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:24,559
she must be alive, must she not?

238
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:28,312
She has not
regained her consciousness yet.

239
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:37,321
We should interrogate him some other time.

240
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,510
You managed to save her life
three years ago.

241
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:03,514
You must have a way
to save her this time as well.

242
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:04,766
Is that not so?

243
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:06,726
Your Majesty.

244
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:08,728
You should return to the palace.

245
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,731
I will stay by the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

246
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,377
I shall return. Lead the way.

247
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:34,921
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,624
Lady Hee-soo and Master Chu
are running late tonight.

249
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,960
The <i>ingyeong </i>will ring soon.

250
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:15,461
INGYEONG: THE CURFEW BELL

251
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:18,005
Did she tell you
she would be heading elsewhere?

252
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,258
How is it any of your concern?

253
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:27,014
Did Master Chu mention anything to you?

254
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,057
What?

255
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,309
He did mention something.

256
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:33,312
Right.

257
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:36,023
It was nothing. You need not know.

258
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:40,027
Are you trying to drive me out of my mind?

259
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,113
Look.

260
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,491
I do not know what came over him
to make such a request,

261
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:49,620
but he asked me to make an offering
in his stead on Hongjang's memorial day.

262
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,081
But he can do that himself, can he not?

263
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,335
Is anyone inside?

264
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:58,588
You seem to have a visitor.

265
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:00,006
That is odd.

266
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:01,882
I am not expecting anyone at this hour.

267
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,060
What is going on?

268
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,314
Who could it be
for it to be dead silent outside?

269
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:28,492
Who is Jageunnyeon?

270
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:34,498
That would be me.

271
00:22:35,499 --> 00:22:36,917
The Inspector General summons you.

272
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,044
Come with us.

273
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:42,673
Wait, is that not Master Choam?

274
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:48,137
I am Jageunnyeon.

275
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,266
Why is Master Choam
looking for me at this hour?

276
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:53,976
You will know once you reach him.

277
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,196
I wonder why they are so serious.

278
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:08,532
Something must have happened here
in Lady Hee-soo's house.

279
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,540
Master Choam.

280
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:20,294
You are here.

281
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,133
Something happened
to Lady Hee-soo, did it not?

282
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:39,480
I noticed

283
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,066
that she had become very frail.

284
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:44,026
What happened?

285
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,864
She has suffered deeply
from her troubled heart.

286
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:53,953
She would skip meals
and have trouble sleeping.

287
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:59,375
I do not think
she intended to go this far.

288
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:06,465
She must have used all her might

289
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,301
to get here.

290
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:38,748
Your Majesty.

291
00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:40,374
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

292
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,964
You may leave.

293
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,602
Remind me of my agenda for today.

294
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:01,812
You have a morning assembly,

295
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,731
a rotational council,
and an evening study.

296
00:25:03,814 --> 00:25:06,984
You must also review the reports
submitted by the offices.

297
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:08,861
Postpone the morning assembly.

298
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:10,362
I shall join the rotational council.

299
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,281
I will also go over the reports
at a later date.

300
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:13,199
Additionally,

301
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,285
I shall have a nighttime study
after the evening study.

302
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:17,912
So do prepare it.

303
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:20,539
Yes, Your Majesty.

304
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,043
I would like to see the Crown Prince.

305
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:25,836
Is he in his lecture?

306
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:29,590
He is at the Queen Dowager's quarters
to greet Her Royal Highness.

307
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:37,932
Here comes His Majesty!

308
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:46,690
Father.

309
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:49,860
Why are you standing out here?

310
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:54,740
I am waiting for permission to enter
from Her Royal Highness.

311
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:01,038
How long have you been waiting?

312
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:03,207
Does she keep you waiting every time?

313
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:10,589
I apologize for my tardiness,
Your Majesty.

314
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:12,007
Please come inside.

315
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,551
The Crown Prince will accompany me.

316
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:23,060
Until when are you going to leave
the Queen's quarters vacant?

317
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,647
Should you not order the court
to issue a decree for a selection?

318
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,358
We are still in mourning.

319
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,944
I will not have such a decree issued

320
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:34,780
while the Crown Prince
remains in mourning.

321
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:37,908
To think the nation
would not have a queen for so long.

322
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:40,160
This is unprecedented.

323
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,580
We shall have a new precedent then.

324
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,252
It seems that you keep
the Crown Prince waiting for a while

325
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,713
whenever he visits to greet you.

326
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:52,798
For what reason are you doing that?

327
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:02,850
I only did so as it was agonizing
to see him in his mourning dress.

328
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:06,478
It is not like
I am refusing to receive him.

329
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:08,522
What harm is there in a little wait?

330
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:16,405
I have failed to consider the agony
you are going through, Mother.

331
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:21,911
For the time being
until your sorrow subsides,

332
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:26,081
I shall have a palace eunuch greet you
on the Crown Prince's behalf.

333
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:32,171
I shall excuse myself first
to attend to matters of state.

334
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:34,632
You should rise as well.

335
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:37,134
We should not keep your lecturers waiting.

336
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:55,611
You wish for me to retract my command?

337
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,950
Are you sure you can bear it?

338
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:05,746
I am aware that you have
given the command for my sake.

339
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:07,873
However,

340
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:11,293
greeting Her Royal Highness
is my duty as her grandchild.

341
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,255
If I refuse to do as much,

342
00:28:14,338 --> 00:28:17,258
I will not be able to handle
anything in the future.

343
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:20,970
Crown Prince.

344
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,723
You are a dutiful child indeed.

345
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,601
Do tell me if you need anything.

346
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,276
You must have something in mind.

347
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,235
What is it?

348
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:41,615
I miss Gidaeryeong Kang, Your Majesty.

349
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:50,958
It is not because I want to play <i>baduk</i>.

350
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,626
How could I indulge myself in pleasure

351
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,837
when I am still in mourning
for my late mother?

352
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:57,172
It is just that

353
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,883
he is my master

354
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:02,511
and I have not seen him in a while.

355
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:06,849
Am I not

356
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:09,310
allowed to see him?

357
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,195
I apologize.

358
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,990
I should not have made such a request.

359
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:36,420
For what reason is His Majesty not issuing
a decree for the selection of the queen?

360
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,505
With his heir secured,

361
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:40,841
he does not feel the need
to rush the matter.

362
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,512
My lord, even if that is
how His Majesty views the matter,

363
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:49,016
we cannot sit idly and watch.

364
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,101
We must appoint a new queen soon,

365
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:53,020
even if only to conduct

366
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:55,814
the memorial services
of the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

367
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:57,191
That is right.

368
00:29:57,274 --> 00:29:59,068
That is what I was trying to say.

369
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,196
Additionally, we must have a new queen

370
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,490
to select a crown princess.

371
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,576
I hear His Royal Highness vowed not to wed

372
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,912
until he is done mourning.

373
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:12,331
Is that not right, Great Lord?

374
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,544
His Royal Highness

375
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,505
is such a dutiful son.

376
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,758
I have broached
the matter to him many times,

377
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,468
but he stayed resolute.

378
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,440
What brings you here?

379
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,609
I am here to convey a royal order.

380
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,987
His Majesty wishes to postpone
the morning assembly set for today

381
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,364
and only attend the rotational council.

382
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,199
I understand.

383
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:49,868
Let us leave now.

384
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,835
The new blunt-lobed spicebush
on the former peach tree's plot

385
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,378
looks very pleasant.

386
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:01,130
Have you noticed it too,
Left State Councilor?

387
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,590
Peach blossoms are quite fine,

388
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:06,093
but they are not as grand
as the flowers of blunt-lobed spicebush.

389
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:09,012
I am looking forward to next spring.

390
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,056
I am flattered by your praise.

391
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,516
Let us go.

392
00:31:16,895 --> 00:31:19,523
When Her Majesty passed away,

393
00:31:19,606 --> 00:31:23,152
I was too bitter
and lost my will to continue on.

394
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:26,363
But life has its twists and turns.

395
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,535
Who would have thought

396
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,622
I would gain such a dutiful grandson
as His Royal Highness?

397
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,000
You are right, Great Lord.

398
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:42,629
Life indeed has its twists and turns.

399
00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:02,733
He must still believe
we are his subordinates.

400
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,817
How foolish.

401
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:07,696
Everyone in the court
is favoring His Royal Highness.

402
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:10,324
Do you not agree, Minister Min?

403
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:14,077
You are not wrong,
but nothing is for certain.

404
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:15,370
What is the problem this time?

405
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:18,957
As His Majesty
and the Queen Dowager's kin,

406
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:20,334
he still remains in power.

407
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:21,376
But what about us?

408
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,796
You are the Crown Prince's grandfather
only in name with no influence.

409
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,964
and I am…

410
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,800
holding my breath
for a marriage that may never happen.

411
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,594
Brother.

412
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:33,597
That was not my decision,
but His Royal Highness's.

413
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,390
You have changed.

414
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:38,602
Becoming the Crown Prince's kin
has changed your attitude.

415
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:40,604
Nothing has changed.

416
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,689
Please do not think so.

417
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:46,610
I must meet the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

418
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,197
Why would you seek my approval

419
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,823
when he is not my subordinate?

420
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:53,242
Have you not heard?

421
00:32:54,326 --> 00:32:57,287
While His Majesty
was in mourning for the late queen,

422
00:32:57,371 --> 00:32:59,248
the <i>gidaeryeong</i> did not enter the palace.

423
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:02,417
He only did so yesterday briefly
and has not come in today.

424
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,586
I asked a runner

425
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,130
and learned that he did not come
without sending any word.

426
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:09,424
His Majesty did not summon him either.

427
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,553
I have been so busy tending
to His Royal Highness

428
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:14,012
that I have been out of touch with him.

429
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,475
I assumed that you and the <i>gidaeryeong</i>

430
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,728
were working together
for His Royal Highness.

431
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:24,731
Was I perhaps mistaken?

432
00:33:25,524 --> 00:33:26,733
Do you now see

433
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,403
how much you have changed?

434
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,042
Do not mind him.

435
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,881
He is only being brusque out of annoyance
regarding the marriage matters.

436
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:12,821
Officials are already flocking
to the Crown Prince

437
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:14,740
and Sixth Royal Secretary Kim Myung-ha.

438
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,159
I knew this would happen.

439
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:19,828
The court is composed of people

440
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,706
who have a knack for detecting
who holds sway in the world.

441
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:26,001
I shall seek the official's support
and petition His Majesty

442
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:27,711
to issue a decree
for the selection of the queen.

443
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,882
Min Ji-hwan has sided
with the Crown Prince.

444
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:36,637
Do you still have
Yoo Hyun-bo's family in mind?

445
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,350
How about the former Minister of Justice
Kim Nae-seon's daughter?

446
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,852
Is his daughter

447
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,064
not your wife's niece?

448
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:49,483
He has people following him

449
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,151
and is close to our family.

450
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:53,987
His daughter would be perfect
as His Majesty's spouse.

451
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,575
You should have thought of that earlier.

452
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,829
What about the Crown Prince
and Kim Myung-ha?

453
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:07,292
I will take care of them all in due time,
so please do not worry.

454
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,894
I was about to deliver
the herbal medicine.

455
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,521
Is His Majesty looking for me?

456
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:31,066
He is still at the hall of governance.

457
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,151
Then what brings you here?

458
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:35,237
Last night,

459
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:38,407
I saw you leave the palace
with Captain Joo.

460
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:40,867
Where did you go?

461
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:43,829
His Majesty was out of the palace.

462
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,248
Did he summon you?

463
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,210
I cannot say.

464
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:29,124
Who is that?

465
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,251
Is that not Senior Court Lady Dong?

466
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,343
Speak the truth.

467
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:43,555
Where was His Majesty last night?

468
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,017
If you tell me,

469
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:50,020
I will reward you handsomely.

470
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:51,271
I apologize,

471
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,941
but I cannot tell you anything.

472
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:04,075
I can easily have you
framed for a crime, flogged,

473
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,120
and expelled out of this palace.

474
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:09,414
Do you wish for such a fate?

475
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,501
What are you doing there?

476
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:21,635
Did you not hear me?

477
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,762
What are you doing back here?

478
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,351
I have been feeling unwell,

479
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:31,812
so I was just asking her for treatment.

480
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:35,023
Is that true?

481
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,822
Yes, my lady.

482
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:42,989
Senior Court Lady Dong…

483
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,951
complained of pain in her shoulders,

484
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,328
so I was about to tend to her.

485
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:27,617
I will give it to you.

486
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:32,247
Who was His Majesty with?

487
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:43,842
You must keep this to yourself.

488
00:38:54,394 --> 00:38:56,813
I do not know whose residence it was,

489
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,523
but he was with Gidaeryeong Kang.

490
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:05,071
But the <i>gidaeryeong</i>…

491
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:09,242
turned out to be a woman.

492
00:39:13,413 --> 00:39:14,247
What?

493
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,709
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>…

494
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:21,963
is a woman?

495
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:33,099
<i>I wondered why His Majesty</i>

496
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:36,561
was so smitten with a lowly <i>baduk </i>player.

497
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,522
I can see why after seeing you up close.

498
00:39:40,523 --> 00:39:41,441
You are a man,

499
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:44,235
yet peculiar.

500
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:46,655
<i>I would like to become your woman.</i>

501
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:49,032
Please allow me to spend a night with you.

502
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,326
I…

503
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:54,079
will not bed you…

504
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,582
nor dismiss you from my quarters.

505
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:06,049
I cannot bring myself to do this.

506
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:08,843
Your Majesty!

507
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,060
<i>I do not understand the reason</i>

508
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:20,313
why you are explaining
His Majesty's heart to me

509
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:23,024
when you are so sure of his affection.

510
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:44,921
Is anyone inside?

511
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:58,560
Have you been on my tail?

512
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:00,437
Do not take this the wrong way.

513
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:03,690
I am here to meet the <i>gidaeryeong</i> as well.

514
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:07,152
Is there no one inside?

515
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:13,283
Do not stand in my way.

516
00:41:13,366 --> 00:41:14,993
Do not act this way.

517
00:41:16,244 --> 00:41:19,289
I want to be on good terms with you.

518
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:21,958
Let us consider the past
water under the bridge

519
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,168
and become good friends.

520
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:26,129
There is no reason for us to be enemies.

521
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,673
You have the audacity
to utter such disgusting words?

522
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:29,716
What is it?

523
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,093
Has the Principal Director
had a change of heart?

524
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:35,096
Did he go back on his promise
about the new queen?

525
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,000
Lady Hee-soo.

526
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:06,127
Where have you gone?

527
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:31,402
I think she is waking up.

528
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,738
My goodness.

529
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:34,781
Master Choam!

530
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:45,708
Your Majesty!

531
00:42:48,503 --> 00:42:49,420
Your Majesty.

532
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:52,799
The news you have been awaiting
has arrived.

533
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:54,217
Has he awakened?

534
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,099
Answer me.

535
00:43:01,683 --> 00:43:02,684
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:43:03,476 --> 00:43:04,644
He has awakened.

537
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,076
What is the matter?

538
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,792
It is enough to hear he has awakened.

539
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:31,921
Eunuch Kim.

540
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:35,091
Yes, Your Majesty. Please speak.

541
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:37,177
I have ordered a nighttime study,

542
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,803
so bring me the Royal Secretary.

543
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:40,013
Yes, Your Majesty.

544
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:27,769
Master Choam.

545
00:44:27,852 --> 00:44:29,938
Why have we not heard from the palace yet?

546
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,900
His Majesty's day is long
and filled with countless duties.

547
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:35,860
He will send word soon.

548
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:41,199
What will happen to Master Chu?

549
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:20,613
Principal Director.

550
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:22,907
What brings you here?

551
00:45:23,908 --> 00:45:26,452
As you keep postponing
the morning assembly,

552
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,622
I have come to convey the court's wishes

553
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:31,457
and to seek your approval.

554
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:35,378
The Chief Royal Secretary
is apprising me of all urgent matters.

555
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:38,297
What is this important matter

556
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,842
that you must report to me yourself?

557
00:45:51,728 --> 00:45:54,188
This is the list
of potential Sixth Royal Secretaries.

558
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:57,400
Please replace Kim Myung-ha.

559
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:02,697
What is the reason?

560
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,410
He is His Royal Highness's
only kin remaining.

561
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:11,122
His holding a position responsible
for relaying royal commands

562
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,749
is not appropriate.

563
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,500
To speak the truth,

564
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:17,879
some people are already lining up
to be on his good side.

565
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:21,007
It would only be proper to dismiss him

566
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:23,968
before he causes any concern
for His Royal Highness.

567
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:25,136
I shall consider it.

568
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:31,934
Inspector General Kim Je-nam
has not come to the palace for days.

569
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:35,897
The same goes for Gidaeryeong Kang.

570
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,234
I advise you to inspect them
for disciplinary actions.

571
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,366
You do not let even a small blunder

572
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,329
slip through the cracks, do you?

573
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:52,997
For officials

574
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:55,917
who have the duty
to serve you and the people,

575
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,169
even a small blunder is a grave crime.

576
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:01,589
If you let this slide,
the discipline of the court will grow lax.

577
00:47:02,173 --> 00:47:04,258
Your words are correct.

578
00:47:05,384 --> 00:47:06,803
Crimes are crimes.

579
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,722
We cannot minimize them as blunders.

580
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,186
I will keep that in mind.

581
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:27,596
Master Choam will give you an earful
if he finds out.

582
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,766
I feel too stuffy.

583
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,853
I will take a short walk and come back

584
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:35,855
before he notices.

585
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,025
My lady.

586
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,069
The night air is chilly.

587
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:49,910
Wait here.

588
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,413
I will quickly go get your robe.

589
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:08,012
You sure have returned quickly.

590
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,268
Your Majesty.

591
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,846
And who might you be?

592
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,604
I will guard this area, so leave.

593
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:00,230
Bollocks.

594
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,692
I suggest <i>you</i> leave.

595
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,653
<i>I </i>will protect Lady Hee-soo.

596
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:13,911
I thought you would never come.

597
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:19,833
I wanted to come running
as soon as I heard you were awake,

598
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:25,297
but I could not bear myself to face you.

599
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,759
The sight of a traitor like me

600
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:32,179
would understandably distress you.

601
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:35,349
It was because of my crime, not yours.

602
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:39,353
The crime that began three years ago

603
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:41,814
and still continues to this day.

604
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:45,609
Your crime?

605
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:48,988
What do you mean by that?

606
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,781
All your actions…

607
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,411
were all that I wished for.

608
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,625
If I had not wished for them,

609
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:07,589
I would not have made you the <i>gidaeryeong</i>,
given you access to Yeongchwijeong,

610
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,885
or kept you at the Grand Prince's side.

611
00:50:13,095 --> 00:50:15,639
I would have punished and expelled you

612
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:17,850
when Princess Jangryeong was substituted.

613
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:23,022
I would have punished you harshly
for high treason

614
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:25,607
when your advice

615
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:30,029
prompted the Queen
to urge the Great Lord to petition

616
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:35,367
for the Grand Prince's appointment
as the Crown Prince during assembly.

617
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:42,291
But Your Majesty,

618
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,002
you threatened to have me killed

619
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:50,299
if I sought any patron other than you
when I first entered Yeongchwijeong.

620
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:51,425
I only did so…

621
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:57,848
to scare you enough
to make you act with caution.

622
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,518
But seeing you refuse
the Queen Dowager's offer

623
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:02,978
changed my mind.

624
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,982
I appointed you the Grand Prince's master

625
00:51:07,483 --> 00:51:10,652
to avoid the Queen Dowager
and the Principal Director's keen eyes

626
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:13,864
and finally carry out

627
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:16,158
what I intended to do.

628
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,332
Appointing Grand Prince Munseong
as the Crown Prince.

629
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:29,505
<i>I </i>took advantage of you.

630
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:33,175
I used you as my shield

631
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:38,555
to veil my doings.

632
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,397
Even if your words are true,

633
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,652
the crimes I committed against you

634
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:54,530
do not go away.

635
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,660
I assume you could not
bring yourself to forgive me

636
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,870
for what I did to you three years ago.

637
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:04,123
That was not the reason.

638
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:14,383
In the evening
Principal Director Park Jong-hwan

639
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,927
intruded into Yeongchwijeong
without your permission,

640
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,806
I was there.

641
00:52:22,975 --> 00:52:24,601
I hid myself

642
00:52:27,062 --> 00:52:29,356
and heard what you said to him.

643
00:52:31,066 --> 00:52:32,818
<i>The appointment of the Crown Prince</i>

644
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:37,406
is merely a trick to overcome the chaos
caused by the strange event.

645
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:41,827
When the people's minds are put at ease,
I can expel and banish him from the palace

646
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,745
and then eliminate him.

647
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:47,624
You are the one who should stop
being foolish and come to your senses.

648
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,295
I am the king of this nation.

649
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:55,132
Anyone who opposes me shall face death

650
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,258
and that includes

651
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,928
my kin who shares my blood.

652
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,020
And thus…

653
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:13,692
you decided to kill me

654
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:17,905
because you became afraid and sick of me.

655
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,955
Had that been the case…

656
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,211
Had I become sick of you,

657
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:36,590
I would have
discarded the plan to harm you

658
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:40,427
and made a rational decision
to wait for the Grand Prince's chance.

659
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,263
The man whom I love

660
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:46,850
revealed his true nature before me

661
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:52,397
as a treacherous and depraved king
just as I have long known.

662
00:53:57,236 --> 00:53:59,780
And yet, my love for you did not diminish.

663
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:02,866
Instead of diminishing,

664
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:07,454
it only grew so painfully strong

665
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:10,582
that it swayed me.

666
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:19,633
That is why I decided to assassinate you.

667
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:26,181
It was to prevent myself
from becoming more captivated by you

668
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:30,894
and to protect the Grand Prince
who was appointed the Crown Prince.

669
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,042
Do you hear my heart beating?

670
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:00,173
Do you hear the mad, racing heartbeat

671
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,676
overcome with joy?

672
00:55:12,728 --> 00:55:15,439
I will not lose you ever again.

673
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,941
I will protect you.

674
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:45,761
I have news to share with you.

675
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,722
Please speak, Your Majesty.

676
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:51,767
My master,

677
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:54,394
Lord Kang Hang-soon, has not passed away.

678
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:55,520
He is alive.

679
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,401
Where is he,

680
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,528
Your Majesty?

681
00:56:04,905 --> 00:56:08,492
He is staying in Beijing to observe
the tension between Qing and Ming.

682
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:10,660
Your Majesty.

683
00:56:10,744 --> 00:56:14,247
Are you saying
that Kang Hang-soon is your spy?

684
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,541
That is right.

685
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:22,172
He was imprisoned in Shenyang and released
while being transferred to Beijing.

686
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,132
But instead of returning,

687
00:56:24,758 --> 00:56:28,095
he decided to hide his identity
and stay in the Qing.

688
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:32,516
His Majesty sent his men several times
asking Lord Kang to return,

689
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,393
but he refused.

690
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:47,948
Your Majesty.

691
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,034
When you mentioned

692
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:56,456
that there was a caretaker in the Qing
to look after Her Highness…

693
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,541
Yes.

694
00:56:59,668 --> 00:57:01,420
I was referring to Master Kang.

695
00:57:08,969 --> 00:57:12,806
I tried to find you at all costs
upon his request.

696
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:15,183
But I could not.

697
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:24,276
Thank you for the letter.

698
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,154
As I shall find what is lost at all costs,

699
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:30,615
make sure you tell them not to worry.

700
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,786
Has there been any progress
on finding what was lost?

701
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:38,832
We have combed through the capital,

702
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:42,252
but we have not found anyone
who knows of or holds the item.

703
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:46,173
You must find it at all costs.

704
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,299
Do you understand?

705
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:51,511
I had my men travel all across the land

706
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:55,432
when you were here all along.

707
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:01,688
I am truly relieved

708
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,986
to have finally heard
the news about my father.

709
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,406
Your Majesty.

710
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,284
You should let Gidaeryeong Kang rest now.

711
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:16,745
She has not fully recovered yet,

712
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:19,331
and her condition could take a bad turn.

713
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:24,586
You heard him.

714
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:26,963
You may leave and rest.

715
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,133
Yes, Your Majesty.

716
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:50,487
My lady.

717
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:02,415
Jageunnyeon.

718
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,336
My father…

719
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:14,094
is alive.

720
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,015
Is that true?

721
00:59:40,287 --> 00:59:41,454
Your Majesty.

722
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:43,498
What will you do with Chu Dal-ha?

723
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,083
Your Majesty.

724
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,794
I know you are conflicted
because of the <i>gidaeryeong</i>.

725
00:59:47,878 --> 00:59:50,881
But Chu Dal-ha
dared to point his knife at you!

726
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,675
We must transfer him
to the State Tribunal for interrogation.

727
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:25,415
Untie the rope.

728
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:26,791
Yes, Your Majesty.

729
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:47,896
You may leave, Sang-hwa.

730
01:00:48,396 --> 01:00:49,814
I cannot, Your Majesty.

731
01:00:49,898 --> 01:00:51,608
He attempted to harm you.

732
01:01:07,499 --> 01:01:08,667
Raise your head.

733
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,298
Is there anything you want to say?

734
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:20,261
Lady Hee-soo
has nothing to do with this incident.

735
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:24,349
I plotted and carried this out
all on my own,

736
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,102
so take my life.

737
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:30,271
Though I am resentful

738
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:33,024
that I could not punish
the wicked criminal

739
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:35,819
who served as a spy for the Qing
to ascend to the throne

740
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:36,903
before my death,

741
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:39,823
I have no regrets.

742
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,368
You truly believe…

743
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:49,833
that I informed against you to the Qing.

744
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:52,585
Are you saying

745
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,671
you did not do it?

746
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:56,172
It would be difficult to believe me.

747
01:01:58,008 --> 01:01:59,592
It does not matter even if you do not.

748
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:07,809
You are a righteous man.

749
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:09,894
As such,

750
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:14,024
I will give you two options
to choose from.

751
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:16,067
You may hide your crimes

752
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,946
and find a way to live on.

753
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:22,240
Or…

754
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,577
you will confess your crimes

755
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,037
and lay down your life

756
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:30,040
to have your resentment resolved.

757
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:35,712
Whatever you choose, I will follow it.

758
01:02:36,755 --> 01:02:37,881
What will you do?

759
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:46,931
Get some rest.

760
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:48,308
My lady!

761
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:50,894
Good grief.

762
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:52,187
Lady Hee-soo needs peace and quiet.

763
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:55,982
My lady, Master Chu is being taken away
by the men of the Special Firearms Unit.

764
01:02:56,483 --> 01:02:57,317
What?

765
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:08,787
Master Choam.

766
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,580
What is going on?

767
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:14,626
His Majesty ordered him
to be transferred to the State Tribunal.

768
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:20,256
Where is His Majesty?

769
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:23,510
He returned to the palace
after giving the command.

770
01:03:27,222 --> 01:03:28,223
My goodness.

771
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:52,914
Your Majesty.

772
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,666
The Chief Royal Secretary is here.

773
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:09,013
Have you summoned me, Your Majesty?

774
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:14,727
Summon the members
of the Border Defense Council.

775
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:15,895
I will interrogate

776
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:18,690
the traitor myself.

777
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:23,403
Yes, Your Majesty.

778
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,738
I shall follow your command.

779
01:04:36,624 --> 01:04:38,710
What is going on, my lord?

780
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:40,837
A man who attempted
to assassinate His Majesty

781
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,505
has been transferred
to the State Tribunal.

782
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:47,969
We must send out the royal summons,
so summon all the clerks and runners.

783
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:49,387
Yes, my lord.

784
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:54,225
My lord.

785
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:56,477
What is the name of the criminal?

786
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:00,857
Chu Dal-ha.

787
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,903
A spy dispatched to the Ming
and caught by the Qing three years ago.

788
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:12,327
SUMMONS

789
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:25,673
My lord.

790
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:27,175
Have you heard the news?

791
01:05:27,258 --> 01:05:29,052
I was about to head to the palace.

792
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:32,972
I came running
as I had urgent news to share.

793
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,684
You would not know who Chu Dal-ha is.

794
01:05:36,768 --> 01:05:39,395
I had forgotten about him
until I heard his name today.

795
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:41,522
Who is he?

796
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:44,817
He is a spy who went to the Ming
and was caught by the Qing.

797
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:47,070
And now, he serves Gidaeryeong Kang.

798
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:50,698
Are you certain?

799
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:52,450
After hearing his name,

800
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:55,828
I went to the State Tribunal
to confirm my doubts.

801
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:57,330
I am certain.

802
01:05:57,413 --> 01:06:01,292
The <i>gidaeryeong</i>
has to be related to this case.

803
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:03,294
Has he truly lost his mind?

804
01:06:03,378 --> 01:06:05,338
Why would he make such a blunder

805
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:08,132
when he holds a position
others can only envy?

806
01:06:08,216 --> 01:06:09,384
After all,

807
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:11,970
he did make a false attestation
three years ago.

808
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:13,930
What with Princess Jangryeong's incident,

809
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:18,059
it would not be so strange
even if he harbored a treacherous intent.

810
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:22,272
False attestation from three years ago?

811
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:24,691
That means

812
01:06:25,525 --> 01:06:27,777
Kim Myung-ha may be implicated as well.

813
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,195
Yes, my lord.

814
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:32,907
They may have committed such an act
for His Royal Highness.

815
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:36,202
I must go see His Majesty immediately.

816
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,039
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

817
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,959
What shocking event is this?

818
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:46,129
Captain Joo Sang-hwa
of the Special Firearms Unit

819
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:48,381
should be punished harshly
for his negligence.

820
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:51,050
He has committed no crime

821
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:54,929
for the traitor's blade did not reach me.

822
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:59,183
The heavens have truly helped.

823
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:05,356
I have looked into
Chu Dal-ha's past doings on my way here.

824
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:07,275
Indeed?

825
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:11,362
You may report them to me.

826
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:16,075
Yes, Your Majesty.

827
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:17,785
To speak the truth,

828
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:21,998
Chu Dal-ha was a spy who was caught
by the Qing three years ago.

829
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,877
He currently works as a butcher
in Banchon Village

830
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,754
with Gidaeryeong Kang Mong-woo
as his patron.

831
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:31,257
Due to the grudges they hold
for the incident three years ago,

832
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:32,717
Kang Mong-woo and Kim Myung-ha

833
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,553
must have given the order
to assassinate you.

834
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:37,305
I shall have them
sent to the State Tribunal

835
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:38,681
for interrogation.

836
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,225
- Please approve of this.
- Principal Director.

837
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:48,816
This interrogation is not to investigate
Chu Dal-ha's crimes.

838
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,530
He has already confessed his crimes.

839
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:57,658
Then…

840
01:07:59,202 --> 01:08:01,621
what is this interrogation for?

841
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,373
Chu Dal-ha made a report.

842
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,959
<i>What must I do</i>

843
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:08,836
to resolve my resentment?

844
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:12,799
Confess your crimes and make a report.

845
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:17,178
Report the wicked spy
who sold you to the Qing

846
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,931
and petition to have them
found and punished.

847
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:33,194
He reported the spy
who put this nation at risk

848
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:36,739
and asked that their crime
be brought to light.

849
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:49,252
I have long awaited this day.

850
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:56,300
The capital traitor
who joined hands with the Qing

851
01:08:56,384 --> 01:09:00,304
and put this nation
and its people in a crisis.

852
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,392
I will find that vile spy

853
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:07,395
and have them punished for high treason.

854
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:11,691
I will have their disgraceful name
engraved in the records…

855
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:18,948
so that the people of this nation…

856
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:25,371
will remember their crime.

857
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:04,368
CAPTIVATING THE KING

858
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:09,207
<i>Hiding the crimes I have committed
has been eating me alive.</i>

859
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:14,462
If His Majesty dares to bring me down,
he will crumble before I do.

860
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,422
<i>Are you suspecting the spy
who colluded with the Qing</i>

861
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:19,425
to be among the members
of the Border Defense Council?

862
01:10:19,509 --> 01:10:22,803
<i>Attacking the Principal Director
will only endanger your reign.</i>

863
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:25,848
For what reason
are you taking such a high risk?

864
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:29,936
Kim Myung-ha
wishes to join hands with you.

865
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:31,896
<i>Are you telling me to take my own life</i>

866
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:33,606
now that you have no use for me?

867
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:36,108
<i>Do you truly believe</i>

868
01:10:36,192 --> 01:10:38,903
your treasonous collusion with the Qing
can remain a secret?

869
