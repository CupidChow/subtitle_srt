1
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,747
Final sequence initializing.

2
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,716
If the experiment succeeds,

3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,351
and we actually
bring back dinosaurs,

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,720
just think of the possibilities.

5
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,522
We just need to account for
the eggs metabolism

6
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:55,590
this time around.

7
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,596
Well, the recalibration adjusts
from metabolic load, so...

8
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,798
Yeah, that's what you
said during batch 22, Jerry,

9
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,265
and look where it got us.

10
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,634
Uh, it...

11
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,636
This is different.

12
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,873
Listen...

13
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,641
We can't afford
any other setbacks.

14
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,443
If this experiment fails,
everything we worked for,

15
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,846
everything my dad
sacrificed for, would just...

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,616
[door opens]

17
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,450
Sterilized and prepped.

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,652
Okay.

19
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,221
Okay...

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,324
Growth inhibitor
stability looks good.

21
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,859
Any shifts in
compound distribution?

22
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,862
Not yet, but we're running
at peak threshold.

23
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,765
Any variation could
lead to a cascade.

24
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,499
Be ready to shut it down.

25
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,602
Yeah, yeah, sure.

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,674
You can almost feel the energy
radiating off of them.

27
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,709
[chuckles]

28
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,915
Integration curves are
matching projections.

29
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,683
Yeah.

30
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:56,718
How's the structural integrity
on the outer membranes?

31
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,520
Stable for now.

32
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,357
Containment fields?

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,628
Fully operational
and holding steady.

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,263
Wait.

35
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,232
There's a slight spike
in the thermal lobe.

36
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,401
Crosscheck the bonding matrix.

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,940
Crosschecking
these levels, and...

38
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,675
There's condensation
near the heat exchanger.

39
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,678
This... This is disrupting
the thermal regulation.

40
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,479
The matrix is compensating.

41
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,715
Still holding steady.

42
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,717
Temperature is stable.

43
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,485
Compound integration
is accelerating.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,257
Here we go.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,297
All right,
stay on your readings.

46
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,199
[beeping]

47
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,702
Oop, serum levels are spiking.

48
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,836
What's the cause?

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,337
It's feeding back into itself.

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,439
The bonding matrix
is overcompensating.

51
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,375
Be you ready
to pull the plug.

52
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,451
Oh!

53
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,687
Oh...

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,187
[squeaking]

55
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,826
Velociraptor mongoliensis...

56
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,429
We did it!

57
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,865
It's real.

58
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,367
I love this island.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,869
No one get too close.

60
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,811
It's growing too fast.
Something's off.

61
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,514
The growth rates are
a little... exponential.

62
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,018
That's impossible.

63
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,252
The compound shouldn't be
able to do that outside of...

64
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,257
Um... Is that
supposed to happen?

65
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,593
Jerry, shut it down.

66
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,629
Yeah.

67
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:50,531
System override.

68
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,533
Emergency protocols engaged.

69
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,702
Uh, three now.

70
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,471
Okay.
Containment protocols, everyone.

71
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,840
The system's kicking in.

72
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,943
Lethal containment gas deployed.

73
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:09,984
Did it work?

74
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,553
It should.

75
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,529
Security, this is lab one.
We've had a containment breach.

76
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,030
<i>Immediate back up requested.</i>

77
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,567
There's been a breach
in Section 1.

78
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:27,769
-Let's move.
-Yes, ma'am.

79
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,875
[grunts]

80
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:40,915
Wait.

81
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,985
They're still moving.

82
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,656
They're growing too fast.
The gas didn't take!

83
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,792
The system's overloading!
It's not responding.

84
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,093
The containment locks
are offline.

85
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,694
Um, where's security?

86
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,096
Aren't they supposed to
be outside the door?

87
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,531
They're securing the perimeter.

88
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,331
If containment fails,

89
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,534
they'll stop the breach
from spreading.

90
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,502
Oh, great.
So what are we, bait?

91
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,805
They're buying us time.

92
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,506
We need to get to the bunker
and regroup.

93
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,811
Get back!

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,649
-Ah!
-No!

95
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:15,683
Emma!

96
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,684
[screaming]

97
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,885
Emma!

98
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,453
Jerry, Pete, you need to move.

99
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,689
Pete!

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,028
Move!

101
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,536
If they break containment,
the entire island as a risk.

102
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,838
Yeah, it's too late for that.

103
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,842
Ah!

104
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,449
Head to the bunker,
regroup with security!

105
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,001
Regina, status report.

106
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,438
All right,
we've got two options.

107
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,575
We stay here,
try to contain the situation.

108
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,545
Other option, we make a
30-minute trek to the port.

109
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,913
Wait for extraction.

110
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,815
Containment of the lab
is going to require

111
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,818
every resource we've got.
But even then, it's a long shot.

112
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,554
Well, staying here
is not viable.

113
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,955
The risk is too high.

114
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,825
Raptors are growing faster
than we projected.

115
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,426
Well, how fast
are we talking about?

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,031
It's hard to say, exactly.

117
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,734
But their growth rate seems
to be exponential.

118
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,869
That hatchlings were the size
of dogs within minutes.

119
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:46,507
Yes, if this rate holds, they'll
be 10 feet in a few hours.

120
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,210
And if it can't contain them,
how big do they get?

121
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,213
If the compound driving
their growth has no limit,

122
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,217
then their size might
be unlimited, too.

123
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,753
If I'm right, they may
never stop growing.

124
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,488
No, that's not how it works.

125
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,658
They can grow as much
as their body can handle.

126
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,796
Velociraptors were
typically 12 feet long.

127
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,932
So, 12 feet?

128
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,867
Yes, if the compound
behaves as expected, yes.

129
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:20,641
Yes, but at their full size,
they'll be deadly... er.

130
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,678
They also have incredibly
keen senses of hearing.

131
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,849
So we'll have to be extra
quiet when moving, then.

132
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:34,922
Coast Guard, come in.

133
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:35,957
[static]

134
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,094
Coast Guard, do you copy?

135
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,133
We need to get the signal out
from the comms room.

136
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,902
What exactly caused the failure?

137
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,874
The power grid overloaded during
the integration process.

138
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,844
The surge interrupted
our fail safes.

139
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,613
And we miscalculated
the growth's energy draw.

140
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,282
This shouldn't have happened.

141
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,452
Protocols should have worked.
We have back up after back up.

142
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,559
Guys, we need
to get out of here.

143
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,728
We've got to get to the roof,
wait for a helicopter.

144
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,596
Yes.
Let's do that.

145
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,031
No, we can't.

146
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,733
The roof's helipad
was converted into

147
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,568
a solar array
a couple of years ago.

148
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,903
Okay, well, in our defense,
the port's a safer option

149
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,638
for the helipad.

150
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,274
It boasts a wider berth
and it's safer for weather.

151
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:30,544
Velociraptors are sharp.

152
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,547
They could probably find
their way up to the roof.

153
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,150
But what we don't know
is if they can swim.

154
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,652
Getting in the water
might be our safest bet.

155
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,555
We don't know that
they cannot not swim.

156
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,157
The data isn't clear.

157
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,092
Okay, but we know that
they're already on the roof.

158
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,328
The water is our safest option.

159
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,564
Hey, guys, they're contained
in this building, right?

160
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:53,234
We just need to get out of here
and get to the docks.

161
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,272
I think we're about
500 feet to the nearest exit.

162
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,909
That's it. 500 feet.

163
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,944
How many are out there?

164
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,180
What do you mean?

165
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,750
How many eggs do we have?
Or how many hatched?

166
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,952
Yeah, both.

167
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:16,590
15 eggs.
Three have hatched so far.

168
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,225
It only takes one
to kill all of us.

169
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,328
Look, we have an armory.
We'll be fine.

170
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,797
If they attack...

171
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,666
Oh, if they attack,
you'll be dead.

172
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,368
If they attack,
I'll just shoot it.

173
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,869
You can't.

174
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:32,039
Okay, bullets don't kill them.
Why not?

175
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,608
Okay, well, actually,
in our research, we found

176
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:38,345
that raptors have a thick layer
underneath their skin.

177
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,347
Much like deep sea fish.

178
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,650
That thick layer
absorbs the energy

179
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,251
of anything that impacts it.

180
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,252
Like bullets.

181
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,054
Yeah, and it makes them...

182
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,789
Impenetrable.

183
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:51,926
Doesn't mean we can't
get them to back off.

184
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,228
So what are we
even debating here?

185
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,831
Velociraptors coming
to attack us?

186
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,766
We have to go. Now.

187
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,802
Okay, listen, the port's
a straight shot,

188
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,771
but we'll be exposed
the entire way.

189
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,640
We don't have enough bullets,

190
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,242
but we can reload
at the comm station.

191
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,147
Then it's settled.

192
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,783
First we head to the comms room,
then we head to the port.

193
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,818
Emergency evac protocols.

194
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:22,690
We need to protect ourselves,
stick together, gear up,

195
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,825
and don't hesitate
if something moves.

196
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,027
Copy that.

197
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,696
Let's go.

198
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,187
Grab everything and
anything you can use.

199
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,322
This won't be enough if
we get caught out there.

200
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:57,825
It's better than nothing.

201
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,860
There's more gear in
the security building.

202
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:01,028
It's halfway up the port.

203
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,730
Could you contact them?

204
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,101
Security, come in.

205
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,836
<i>This is Carter.</i>

206
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,204
<i>We've got movement near</i>
<i>the west perimeter.</i>

207
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,906
<i>What's your status?</i>

208
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,707
We're still in the lab
preparing to move out.

209
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,243
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We'll be waiting for you here.</i>

210
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,780
Okay, we follow
evacuation protocols.

211
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,348
We head back into the lab

212
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:24,485
and go to the comms room and
then straight to the port.

213
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,153
Here.

214
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,125
We'll try the comms room,
but after that we just need

215
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,961
to get out of the building
and lock these things inside.

216
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,367
[clatter, roaring]

217
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:41,802
Oh...

218
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,339
Look...

219
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,008
We're all we have
on this island.

220
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,111
Stick together.
No heroics.

221
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,246
Copy that.

222
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,917
Let's move.

223
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:07,161
[clattering, roaring]

224
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,797
The comms room is a straight
to shot down this hall.

225
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,800
We get there,
re-establish contact.

226
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,768
-Figure out our next move.
-Yeah, all right.

227
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:16,971
Let's go.

228
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,527
[beeping]

229
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,530
That's him?
That's your guy on the island?

230
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:43,931
Right on time.

231
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,505
Let's get ready.

232
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,312
[clang]

233
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,902
[clatter]

234
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,309
Sorry.

235
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,274
[glass cracks]

236
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:37,978
[distant growling]

237
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,622
[chittering]

238
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,145
[chittering]

239
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,586
It's tracking us.

240
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,990
[roaring]

241
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,930
[roaring]

242
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,334
It has our scent.

243
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,706
Let's move.

244
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,395
That one, yeah.

245
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,266
[radio static]

246
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,535
Shh.

247
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,487
[radio static]

248
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,757
Why is it doing that?

249
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,324
Maybe electrical interference?

250
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:42,697
Testing comms?

251
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,199
Let's just get out of here,
okay? They're gonna hear us!

252
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,704
[pounding, gasping]

253
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,640
[distant roaring]

254
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,644
[dinosaur steps pounding]

255
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,320
Testing comms?

256
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,655
[static]

257
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,757
Come on, give me something.

258
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:25,673
This is Dr. Marie Bessette
at Campbell Research Facility

259
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,508
on Mahaka Island.

260
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:31,345
We are facing a containment
breach of a biological threat.

261
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:35,148
Immediate rescue...
Immediate rescue requested.

262
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,752
Repeat, immediate
rescue requested.

263
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,691
This is Dr. Bessette.

264
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,359
We're stranded on Mahaka Island

265
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,862
with dangerous
biological threats.

266
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,664
We need immediate evacuation.

267
00:18:55,837 --> 00:19:01,141
<i>[static] Mahaka... deploy...</i>
<i>island... dangerous.</i>

268
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:08,616
We have a containment breach of
a dangerous biological threat.

269
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,718
Immediate rescue requested.

270
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,289
<i>90 minutes...</i>
<i>Hold your position.</i>

271
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,664
An hour and a half?
Great.

272
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:23,865
We need rescue.

273
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,200
They're coming for us.

274
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,670
We're just on our own for now.

275
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,271
Then let's get out of here.

276
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,707
-[clatter]
-Oh!

277
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,643
What was that?

278
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:37,344
[powering down]

279
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,948
Power's out.

280
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:42,416
No, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,226
Okay, okay.

282
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,397
Auxiliary backup's
engaged, but...

283
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,600
Without main power,
the maglocks are offline.

284
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,301
That means we can't lock
the raptors in the lab

285
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,670
until we restore the power.

286
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,510
No barriers, no fail safes.

287
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:12,379
We can't sit here and panic.

288
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,648
We need to assess the damage,

289
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,717
secure what we can,
and keep moving.

290
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,021
The longer we wait,
the worse it's going to get.

291
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,023
We have to go.

292
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,624
Sitting is not an option.

293
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,860
Follow me.

294
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,336
We're just a couple hundred
feet away from an exit.

295
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,629
Stay close.

296
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:02,964
What if they don't come for us?

297
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:06,266
Well, then we find another way.

298
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,539
Let's go.

299
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,555
Through here.

300
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,872
[roaring]

301
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,778
[roaring]

302
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,983
We got to go. Now!

303
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,425
[roars]

304
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,459
Oh, God!

305
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,562
Max, don't!

306
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:08,763
[gunfire]

307
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,067
Max!

308
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,101
-Come on, come on.
-Max!

309
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,040
Come on, come on.
Go, go!

310
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:20,473
Lock the door.

311
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,712
[Max screaming]

312
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:30,885
This plan isn't working.

313
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,587
You got a better idea?

314
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,655
I might have an idea.

315
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,858
If I can override the maglocks,

316
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,693
I can trap the raptors
inside the lab.

317
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:41,929
The tunnels have a containment
override near the server vault.

318
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,831
You're planning on
heading down there?

319
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,833
What about evacuation protocols?

320
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:48,169
This is our chance
to contain the raptors.

321
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,105
If they get out onto the island,
who knows what could happen?

322
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,609
What if that doesn't work?

323
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:56,878
Well, at least our research
will be safe.

324
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:57,979
Without it,
we've lost everything

325
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:00,615
we've worked hard for.

326
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:04,051
If it doesn't work, I'll grab
the data and head to the port.

327
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,686
-You need me.
-Pete...

328
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,487
I set the servers up.

329
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,123
Without me you're wasting
time you don't have.

330
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:14,762
All right, but we move fast
and you follow my lead.

331
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,130
And you think
you'll make it back?

332
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,934
Let us help you.

333
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:25,438
No, this is my lab.
It's my responsibility.

334
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,008
Your priority is the port.

335
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,009
Yeah.

336
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,043
[growling]

337
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,946
He's back.

338
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,650
Then we split.

339
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,785
Marie, Pete,
you take the tunnels.

340
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:40,487
The rest of us head
topside for the port.

341
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:42,089
Let's move.

342
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:18,926
Do you think any
of the velociraptors

343
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,561
could've got down here?

344
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,679
[clatter]

345
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,080
Sorry.

346
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,763
The exit should be
just up ahead.

347
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,181
What is it?

348
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,216
What do you see?

349
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,592
Light.

350
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,898
Great.

351
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,069
Keep your eyes open.

352
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,888
We're too exposed out here.

353
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,157
They'll spot us.

354
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,959
Stay focused.

355
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,196
This way.

356
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,944
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

357
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:38,058
Hey, is that Carter?

358
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,024
Cover me.

359
00:28:10,057 --> 00:28:11,258
Stay here.

360
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:32,246
[roaring]

361
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,221
Easy now.

362
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,957
-[growls]
-Easy.

363
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,214
[chittering]

364
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:44,885
Shoot it.

365
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,422
Shoot it.

366
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,360
Move!

367
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,531
Move!

368
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,199
[gunfire]

369
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,948
Reggie, I've got it pinned.
Make it happen!

370
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,483
Shoot it in the eyes!

371
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,590
[whimpering]

372
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,062
Reloading! Hold on!

373
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,371
[gunfire]

374
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:40,274
Inside!

375
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,377
Stephen, get in here!

376
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:47,348
[hyperventilating]

377
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,882
[screaming]

378
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,657
[hyperventilating]

379
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,358
That thing is still out there!

380
00:30:57,391 --> 00:30:59,893
It's not getting in here
unless we let it.

381
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,896
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!

382
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:06,601
It's not getting in here
unless we let it.

383
00:31:06,634 --> 00:31:08,902
Stay focused.

384
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,371
Yeah... sure.

385
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,375
They're territorial.

386
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,310
Any loud noise, or movement...

387
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,546
Not just that.

388
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,147
Did you notice the way it moved?

389
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,884
Deliberate.
Calculated.

390
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,155
The bullets barely phased it.

391
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:32,560
You said they had a layer
under the skin.

392
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:36,631
But those shots, they ricocheted
right off the carapace.

393
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:40,535
Its scales are like armor.

394
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:43,137
So what are we supposed to do?

395
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,972
It's out there on the island.

396
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,341
We adapt.

397
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,513
We scatter its attention,
exploit its instincts.

398
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:55,249
If we can distract it
long enough, we can move.

399
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,486
We need a plan.

400
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:08,195
Get to the armory, regroup,

401
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,030
and get the hell off
this island.

402
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,369
You with me?

403
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:19,406
Okay.

404
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,675
Let's go.

405
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,104
Hold on.

406
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,242
There's no airflow down here.

407
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,411
It's not a good sign.

408
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:40,722
God.

409
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,468
The casing's cracked.

410
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:43,611
We'll need to bypass
the main relay.

411
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,213
Right.

412
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,249
The servers look intact.

413
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:51,786
I need you focus on
the primary backups.

414
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,420
I need that research.

415
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,823
All of it.

416
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:20,480
[chittering]

417
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,483
Marie.

418
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,721
Don't move.

419
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,371
[powering up]

420
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,277
The maglocks should seal off
the primary access points,

421
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,412
funneling everything
to the central corridor.

422
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,515
That gives us a clear
access route to the port.

423
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:55,516
Yeah.

424
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,384
We need to keep moving.

425
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,753
There's no reason they
won't circle back.

426
00:36:58,786 --> 00:36:59,787
Right.

427
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,590
Oh, for...

428
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,358
Go ahead.

429
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,661
I'm not leaving you.

430
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:07,695
Go.

431
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,513
I'm sorry, Marie.

432
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:29,751
[powering down]

433
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,889
Crap.

434
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,695
Pete?

435
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,640
[beeping]

436
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:04,484
[beeps]

437
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:06,020
Good.

438
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:08,321
-Prepare the crew, dock in 10.
-Copy.

439
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:11,793
Think they'll be ready?

440
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,396
Guess we'll see.

441
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,704
You, uh...

442
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,706
You really think this building
the safest place to be?

443
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,642
No place is safe.

444
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,343
But this building has
its own power supply.

445
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:33,346
The generator room's down this
hall on the way to the armory.

446
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,049
More guns.

447
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,584
You know, the ones
we've used so far

448
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,385
have only just annoyed them.

449
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:39,854
If there's anything
that's going to stop them,

450
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:42,590
it's going to be in that room.

451
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,792
In the armory.

452
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:46,459
Locked, right?

453
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,564
We need to get to
the generator room to access it.

454
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:52,700
All right. Better keep moving if
we want to stay ahead of them.

455
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,434
Hey.

456
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,138
Stay close and stay sharp.

457
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,405
Got it?

458
00:38:58,438 --> 00:38:59,740
Okay.

459
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:01,008
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,643
Follow me.

461
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,788
Hey.

462
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:15,388
What about the roof?

463
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:19,426
Open space. Visibility.
We can see them coming.

464
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:24,165
And when they surround us,
you want visibility?

465
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:26,433
I want firepower.

466
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:29,804
The generator gives us
a fighting chance.

467
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,471
Stay close.

468
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,686
Here you go, doc.

469
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,122
Okay.

470
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:53,027
Fuel lines, emission sequence.

471
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,562
Circuit relays.

472
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:55,696
Look, if we don't
get this running,

473
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,732
the armory stays locked.

474
00:39:57,765 --> 00:40:00,067
Let me see if it's all
still wired together.

475
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:01,602
Give me a minute.

476
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,808
The ignition coil looks fried.

477
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:09,476
I need to reroute
to the back of the circuit.

478
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,113
And then...

479
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,920
Let there we light.

480
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,123
Nice work.

481
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,660
[roaring]

482
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,130
We've got company.

483
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,098
Should I shut it down?
We can hide.

484
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:32,700
No.

485
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,735
We're not waiting around
for it to find us.

486
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,436
Follow me.

487
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:56,524
This is it.
Cover me while I get it open.

488
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:58,125
[growling]

489
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,828
Keep your head straight and
your finger on that trigger.

490
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:06,901
[growling]

491
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,501
Reggie...

492
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:09,770
Reggie!

493
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,773
Reggie!

494
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,042
Inside! Now!

495
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,744
[growling]

496
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,752
This should hold for now.

497
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,828
Well, this will even the odds.

498
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:39,166
Do you know how
to use that thing?

499
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,868
Point and shoot.

500
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,937
Just don't get in
the way when I do.

501
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,773
[banging]

502
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:46,941
Get behind me.

503
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:53,114
If we don't shoot now,
we're dead.

504
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,516
[banging]

505
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:00,821
[metal tears]

506
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,809
Is it, uh...

507
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:25,713
Is it dead?

508
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:32,253
Looks pretty dead.

509
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,628
Let's move.

510
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,129
Run, before it gets up!

511
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:43,330
Let's go!

512
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,234
Cover me!

513
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:58,079
[gunfire]

514
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,055
It's still moving!

515
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,060
Jerry! Jerry!

516
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:14,862
It's enough!

517
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:17,798
Hey! Hey!
Hey, look at me.

518
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,400
Look at me.

519
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,102
It's enough.

520
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:24,138
It was trying to kill us.

521
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,148
Its territory.

522
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,185
Instinct.

523
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:43,657
They're not just chasing us.

524
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:49,697
They're eliminating competition.

525
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:52,933
Survival of the fittest.

526
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,707
I am really starting
to hate this island.

527
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,815
You and me both.

528
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,393
You get the drones calibrated?

529
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:53,994
Affirmative.

530
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:55,196
Outfitted it with the new

531
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:56,864
injectors-quad
sedative chambers.

532
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:58,365
Staggered doses.

533
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,467
One latch,
immobilize anything.

534
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:03,704
Nice work, Lance.

535
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:28,162
[clang]

536
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:29,463
[gasps]

537
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,075
-Oh!
-Oh my gosh!

538
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,810
Sorry.

539
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:43,978
Are you okay?

540
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,479
Yeah.

541
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,047
I'll just doubled back
to check the junction.

542
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,449
I thought maybe
the power was cut there.

543
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:49,817
Was it?

544
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,022
Okay, stay close.

545
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:15,142
Okay...
Okay, this way.

546
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,045
What is it?

547
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:23,518
The rock at exit four
is much softer.

548
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,052
When they built these tunnels,

549
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:26,820
they cut through the
shale to save time.

550
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:28,422
Softer rock?

551
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,824
You mean easier for
velociraptors to tear through?

552
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,263
There's an old junction
a hundred meters ahead.

553
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:39,199
If obstacle one,
if option one is blocked,

554
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,335
we can cut through there.

555
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:42,936
And what if that's blocked, too?

556
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,041
We dig.

557
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:50,811
-Let's go.
-[chittering]

558
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,315
Come, come.

559
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:05,059
Through here.

560
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:25,245
Look.

561
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,247
We're not there yet, right?

562
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:30,184
Keep your eyes
open and stay close.

563
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:31,285
Come on.

564
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,335
They're not moving randomly.

565
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,471
What are you saying?

566
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,476
The power surge.

567
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,077
When I rerouted it,
it sent a signal

568
00:47:57,111 --> 00:47:58,979
through the entire system.

569
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:01,516
If they're attuned to
electromagnetic fields...

570
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,317
Like sharks or birds?

571
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,654
Then they felt it.

572
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:08,989
It's drawing them closer.

573
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:11,325
So the lights didn't
just bring us back online?

574
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,193
They lit us up like a beacon.

575
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,363
[clanging]

576
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,535
The magnetic locks are down.

577
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:21,703
If they got in here once...

578
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,270
They can do it again.

579
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:40,120
[grunts]

580
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:41,321
Let me try.

581
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:44,158
[grunting]

582
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:56,571
Looks like...

583
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,677
The secondary exit is
200 meters away.

584
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,179
[banging]

585
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:06,346
It's back.

586
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,315
-Let's move.
-Come on.

587
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:16,256
Which way?

588
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:23,397
Keep moving.

589
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,332
How much farther?

590
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:27,367
[growling]

591
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:32,206
[snuffling]

592
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:45,620
Oh, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

593
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,322
The busted electrical junction.

594
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,157
I bet it's disorienting
the raptor's senses.

595
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,059
Marie?

596
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:54,127
If I can overload the system,

597
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:56,396
I bet the burst would scramble
its equilibrium long enough

598
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,464
for us to get away.

599
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:58,633
Marie, hurry!

600
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,338
Hurry!

601
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,279
[screeches]

602
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:25,660
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

603
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:29,597
That's not the Coast Guard.

604
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,133
Well, then who are they?

605
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,202
I don't know.

606
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,540
Well, maybe they're here
to evacuate us.

607
00:50:38,573 --> 00:50:40,340
The scientists, back up...

608
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,309
Look at the ship.

609
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:44,344
Well, we can't
just stand around here.

610
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,847
If this is our way out,
we're going.

611
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,349
Look, we don't know that.

612
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,184
All right?
We need to stay cautious.

613
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:53,621
How do we do that?

614
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:59,561
We watch, wait,
see who gets off first.

615
00:50:59,594 --> 00:51:01,461
We can't just wait.
Those creatures will--

616
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:03,130
Do you trust me?

617
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,879
Well, well, well.

618
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:19,847
That's close enough.

619
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:21,683
Looks like we found
what we're looking for.

620
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,519
Eric Cranston.

621
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,324
Never thought I'd have the
displeasure of seeing you again.

622
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:32,560
State your business.

623
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:34,662
Our business is simple.

624
00:51:34,696 --> 00:51:36,363
We've come to retrieve
the raptors.

625
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,902
That's not going to happen.

626
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:42,804
If you think you could
control them...

627
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:45,272
you're wrong.

628
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:49,176
We have not come
to control anything.

629
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,878
We've come to collect.

630
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,313
You're not getting anything
off this island.

631
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:59,353
I don't think you're in
a position to negotiate.

632
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:04,626
You know, I don't think
I like you.

633
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:06,728
Kill her.

634
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,729
[gunshot]

635
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:09,196
Reggie!

636
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:13,500
Don't let... this be...
for nothing.

637
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:21,809
Don't let them...

638
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:25,847
-Let's go.
-No! No!

639
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,515
No! Don't!

640
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:32,553
Let's go.

641
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,187
Listen to me,
we're all in danger.

642
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,255
[grunts]

643
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:36,724
Don't do this.

644
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:38,325
We'll take our chances.

645
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:40,227
Let's go.

646
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:50,638
Oh, God.

647
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:02,650
Sweep the area and
secure the perimeter.

648
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,384
I don't want any surprises.

649
00:53:04,418 --> 00:53:05,485
Got it.

650
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,802
[grunts]

651
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:47,962
[roars]

652
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:51,364
Marie, come on!

653
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:56,537
[grunting]

654
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,874
If I don't make it out,
you have to finish this.

655
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,509
What are you talking about?

656
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:02,710
I'm not just trying
to save the building.

657
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:04,311
No.

658
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:05,312
No, it's the only way
to stop them all.

659
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:06,313
Marie...

660
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:07,849
You have to promise me.

661
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:09,617
If I don't make it out,
you go to the failsafe console.

662
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,351
You detonate everything.

663
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:12,887
We're both making
it out of here. Come on.

664
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:17,424
Wait a minute, the hatch!

665
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:18,626
You first. Go.

666
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,327
[growling]

667
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:22,864
Go, go, go.

668
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,869
Come on, open it.

669
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:29,537
Open it! Push!

670
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,873
It won't.

671
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:33,674
[screeching]

672
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,043
[struggling]

673
00:54:40,413 --> 00:54:42,884
Go! Go, go, go!

674
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:51,592
[roars]

675
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:00,001
[gunshots]

676
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:16,449
Dr. Wilson, do you want a beer?

677
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:17,618
You...

678
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:23,658
You turned my research
into this disaster.

679
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:26,027
You think I really wanted
to come to this island

680
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,062
with dinosaurs
roaming around free?

681
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:30,031
Yeah, I don't think so.

682
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:32,733
What's your plan?

683
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:36,704
You think you'd just show up and
that we'd hand them over to you?

684
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,473
Yeah, pretty much so.

685
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:47,682
Who's working for you? Huh?

686
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,383
You have to have
somebody in the inside.

687
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,721
You showing up on the day those
eggs hatched is no coincidence.

688
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:56,824
Who is it?

689
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,063
Who is it?
Is it someone from security?

690
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:03,965
Dr. Panfilov.

691
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,399
Peter?

692
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,538
Peter?

693
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:13,841
No, he's been with us
since the beginning.

694
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,178
Yes, and he has been a more
than reliable source

695
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:20,815
of information from
the beginning as well.

696
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:23,450
He's not like that.

697
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:25,720
Now you're being naive.

698
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,188
We all are.

699
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,725
Not Pete. No.

700
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:33,661
I have a more interesting
question.

701
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:36,530
Your girl.
Is she still alive?

702
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:41,135
Marie? He...
He's with her.

703
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:44,471
She's in danger.
You have to save her.

704
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:47,909
She is really
not that important.

705
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:52,213
What is important, though,
is your buddy Pete.

706
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,749
Why?

707
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:58,219
Well, if he's dead,

708
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:00,487
you'd become very,
very valuable to me,

709
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:03,124
a commodity indeed.

710
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:07,662
But if Pete's still alive,
you're dinofood.

711
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:14,501
If you think I'm going to help
you, you're out of your mind.

712
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:18,239
Oh, my friend,
make no mistake about it.

713
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:20,975
You are going to help me.

714
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:23,044
Every man has his price.

715
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:26,681
And if I were you, I'd start
thinking about what yours is.

716
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:41,595
Get the remaining team moving.

717
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:44,932
I want those creatures
prepped and secured.

718
00:57:44,966 --> 00:57:46,734
And if the tunnels are
completely breached?

719
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,869
Contain the situation here.

720
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:50,771
Time for Panfilov to return.

721
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,909
Pete, look, a flare.

722
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,177
The Coast Guard, they're here.

723
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,045
No.

724
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,080
Who else would it be?

725
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:00,815
It's not the Coast Guard.

726
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:02,783
Of course it's them.

727
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:04,719
You need to leave.
Get to the ridge.

728
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:06,520
It's the safest option.

729
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:08,823
Pete, there is a rescue team
out there for us.

730
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:11,692
It's not a rescue team, okay?

731
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:14,261
You need to trust me.
Just go.

732
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:15,963
Marie, please.

733
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:17,865
What are you talking about?

734
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:20,001
The failsafe.

735
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,268
Are you really willing to
blow up this whole island?

736
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:22,937
Sacrifice yourself?

737
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,974
Yes, if that's what it
takes to stop this.

738
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:29,210
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

739
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:30,644
What wasn't supposed to happen?

740
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:33,214
What wasn't supposed
to happen?

741
00:58:33,247 --> 00:58:36,150
He said it would be
controlled, contained.

742
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,151
I didn't have a choice.

743
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:38,786
Controlled?

744
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:39,787
You better tell me what
you're talking about.

745
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,921
[footsteps approaching]

746
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,793
Hide!
Hide, hide, hide.

747
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:50,297
-It's them.
-Who's them?

748
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:51,699
Run.

749
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:52,867
What?

750
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,069
Just go.
Okay, I can handle this.

751
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:56,804
Not until you tell
me what's going on.

752
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,239
Marie, if you don't leave now,

753
00:58:58,272 --> 00:58:59,840
you won't have
a chance, all right?

754
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,709
You better tell me
what's going on.

755
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:04,979
Marie, just go. Please.

756
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:09,984
You better hope
I find you alive.

757
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:28,002
Where you going?

758
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:29,603
You sure found me fast.

759
00:59:30,971 --> 00:59:32,740
Where's the scientist?

760
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:33,908
She's dead.

761
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:36,677
How?

762
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,179
How do you think?

763
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:40,815
We got separated in the tunnel.
She was torn to bits.

764
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:42,917
I'm not buying it.

765
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,819
Well, you're welcome
to go to the tunnels

766
00:59:44,852 --> 00:59:46,620
and find out for yourself.

767
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:50,357
If I find out you're lying,

768
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:52,860
you're not making
it off this island.

769
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:55,629
That's not the scariest thing
I've heard all day.

770
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:56,797
Yeah, we'll see about that.

771
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,834
Find her.

772
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,135
Come on.

773
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:30,030
Spread out.
She couldn't have gone far.

774
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:50,184
You have to call your men back.

775
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,952
Why?

776
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,320
The raptors will pick
up their scent.

777
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:54,321
It's only a matter of time.

778
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,990
[snarling]

779
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,126
We're prepared.

780
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,961
You don't understand.

781
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:02,463
The tunnels were breached.

782
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,398
We barely made it
out of there alive.

783
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,399
[gunfire, growling]

784
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:07,268
Private York!

785
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,484
Regroup!

786
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,286
They're too fast.
We have to move!

787
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:26,720
Hey!

788
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:28,222
[gunfire]
Oh!

789
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,062
[grunts]

790
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:52,880
[grunts]

791
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:55,416
Prepare the hover cart!

792
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,917
Roger that.

793
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,034
[distant gunfire]

794
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:09,890
Give me the hard drive.

795
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:12,960
Don't you want
to know why I did it?

796
01:03:12,993 --> 01:03:13,994
No.

797
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,065
I have stage 2
pancreatic cancer.

798
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:23,505
It was in remission,
but now it's back.

799
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:30,311
I spent everything I had
stopping it the first time.

800
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:31,812
I couldn't leave my family
with nothing now.

801
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,550
God, you could have told us.

802
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:38,520
We could have done something
and avoided all of this.

803
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:40,254
My dad trusted you.

804
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,955
Hey, I trusted you.

805
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,092
The bills were piling up.
I didn't have anything.

806
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,327
I was completely out of money

807
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,995
and then Eric Cranston
showed up...

808
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:51,131
Oh, God, I should have known
that man was involved somehow.

809
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:53,200
He said he would
pay for everything.

810
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:56,604
And not just that, he said
he'd set my family up for life.

811
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,340
You know, before my dad died,

812
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:01,108
he cut Eric out because
he knew exactly

813
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,943
what kind of monster Eric was.

814
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:07,247
He knew that Eric wanted to use
the raptors as weapons of war.

815
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:08,916
I was desperate.

816
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:10,250
I could have helped you.

817
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:11,519
You would have sidelined me.

818
01:04:11,553 --> 01:04:14,589
We all could have helped you.
You could have gotten treatment.

819
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:17,191
But instead, you had to go
off and sabotage everything

820
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:18,392
and now people are dead.

821
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,461
Emma is dead.
Max is dead.

822
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:21,962
The team is dead.

823
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:23,531
And I don't know who else.

824
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:25,332
Just shoot me, okay?
Because I'm a dead man anyway.

825
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:32,574
My dad kept this research
facility running

826
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:35,409
with everything he had
on a shoestring budget

827
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:37,244
with impossible deadlines,

828
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:40,047
all while trying to fend off
arms dealers like Cranston.

829
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,417
And he sacrificed
everything because he knew

830
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,019
that Eric Cranston
wanted this research

831
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:48,088
and you just gave it to him.

832
01:04:48,122 --> 01:04:49,957
I thought I could control it.

833
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,926
I thought that if I just
gave him enough information

834
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,663
to keep him satisfied,
that I could keep him out.

835
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:00,033
I didn't know he...

836
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:04,471
He didn't just want information.

837
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,940
He wanted control.

838
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:08,643
And when I said I was done,
he threatened to take back

839
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:10,944
all the money
he'd given my family.

840
01:05:10,978 --> 01:05:12,212
When I said screw the money,

841
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,114
he threatened my niece
and my sister.

842
01:05:14,148 --> 01:05:16,350
He said
he'd make them disappear.

843
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:17,985
So you sacrificed us.

844
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:19,353
Yes, for my family.

845
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:31,098
I never thought
it would get this far.

846
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:37,739
It always goes this far because
people like Eric do not stop

847
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,207
until there is nothing left.

848
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:44,044
I can fix this.

849
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:45,647
No, you're out of fixes.

850
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:49,450
Found them!

851
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:52,386
Run.

852
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:53,420
No.

853
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:56,256
You don't have to do this.

854
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,959
It makes me sick knowing that
you helped people like this.

855
01:06:01,128 --> 01:06:02,162
Easy.

856
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,001
Look, the boss wants
both of you guys alive.

857
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:09,604
Don't make me regret this.

858
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,609
Let's go.

859
01:06:14,642 --> 01:06:16,310
Come on.

860
01:06:16,343 --> 01:06:18,312
Let's go.

861
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,016
[grunting]

862
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:25,452
Get over there.

863
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:28,288
-Jerry.
-Marie!

864
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:29,757
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

865
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:30,991
Yeah.

866
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:39,601
Dr. Bessette, you really
messed up my mini-dino soldiers.

867
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,537
They're not your dino soldiers.

868
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,171
Oh, I beg to differ.

869
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:46,173
They are mine.

870
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:48,408
Collateral for the money
your father borrowed from me.

871
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:52,346
You keep my dad out of this.
He didn't borrow a single cent.

872
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:56,518
187 million dollars,
to be exact.

873
01:06:57,785 --> 01:06:59,587
Impossible.

874
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:03,525
No, we had investors,
seed money.

875
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:06,226
Yes, yes, that's very true.

876
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,328
But see, daddy didn't
realize how much

877
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:09,831
it was going to cost
to raise dinosaurs.

878
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:12,065
Very, very expensive
proposition,

879
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:13,735
and a big miscalculation.

880
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,603
Came to me.

881
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,404
I went to my team
to borrow the money.

882
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:22,209
Now, unfortunately,
daddy has passed away.

883
01:07:22,242 --> 01:07:25,513
My condolences, but the tab
still needs to be paid.

884
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:28,081
You don't happen to have
187 million lying around,

885
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,483
do you, dear?

886
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,318
I didn't think so.

887
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:34,756
So they're going to collect
on what they paid for.

888
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:36,591
The dinos are theirs.

889
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:38,392
To use for warfare?

890
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,795
I really don't care
what they use them for.

891
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:43,698
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

892
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:46,601
These raptors are
killing machines.

893
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:49,102
You're never going to make it
to your final destination.

894
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:53,273
They will destroy everything
on this ship, including you.

895
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,475
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

896
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:58,245
[growling]

897
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,214
See?

898
01:08:08,488 --> 01:08:10,758
Now you're going
to get to see your handiwork

899
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,627
up close and personal.

900
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:27,809
You must be so proud.

901
01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:45,459
Helicopter inbound.

902
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:49,597
Coast Guard.

903
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:53,266
Get the welcoming party ready.

904
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,169
We maintain full control
of this island at all costs.

905
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:57,204
Yes, sir.

906
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:05,212
This is the
United States Coast Guard.

907
01:09:05,245 --> 01:09:07,314
You're in a restricted area.

908
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:09,182
Lower your guns!

909
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:11,485
Lower them, boys.
You heard the man.

910
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:21,796
We have to figure
a way out of here.

911
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,266
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

912
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:28,468
We've been waiting
for your arrival, sir.

913
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:31,839
Secure this site and
keep an eye on the personnel.

914
01:09:31,873 --> 01:09:36,276
I, uh... I wouldn't do that
if I were you, young man.

915
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:38,980
Lieutenant, there is no reason
to escalate this situation.

916
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,448
And you, you have
a family to think about.

917
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:49,524
Did that raptor just move?

918
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:52,894
What are you, a tough guy?

919
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:56,564
No, Lieutenant.
I'm not tough at all.

920
01:09:58,265 --> 01:09:59,834
I'm a leader.

921
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,935
Light it up!

922
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:07,274
They're all dead, boss.

923
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:08,776
Clean it up. Quickly.

924
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:09,811
Yes, sir.

925
01:10:09,844 --> 01:10:11,378
Tough guy, huh?

926
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,296
Oh, no...

927
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:32,600
[growling]

928
01:10:46,848 --> 01:10:48,883
Do a final sweep of the ship.

929
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,350
No loose ends.

930
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,757
You're a lucky man, Pete.

931
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,692
Your family will
be set for life.

932
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:13,440
It looks like
the sedative is wearing off.

933
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:19,747
We're out of time.

934
01:11:21,716 --> 01:11:23,918
If he lunges through this door,
he can break through.

935
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:28,523
How do you prevent
it from lunging at us?

936
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,792
Just make him focus on it.

937
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,960
Give him no other target.

938
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:34,361
Are you insane?

939
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:36,798
Pete and I thought that--

940
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:39,534
Screw Pete.

941
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:41,102
No, listen.

942
01:11:41,135 --> 01:11:44,005
Pete and I thought
that electromagnetic fields

943
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,840
might disorient the raptors.

944
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:47,942
Okay.

945
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:53,681
So, if I create a feedback loop,
it might emit a field.

946
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:56,651
You sure you're not just
gonna fry us?

947
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:57,852
Maybe don't touch that.

948
01:12:00,588 --> 01:12:01,823
Don't make it too strong.

949
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:03,090
We need it to
open the door.

950
01:12:06,794 --> 01:12:10,397
Then we direct its attention to
the door and get it to attack.

951
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,099
Well, make it quick.

952
01:12:12,133 --> 01:12:13,768
The raptor is waking up fast.

953
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:18,873
Hey...

954
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:20,007
Hey, it's working.

955
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,482
I really hope this works.

956
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:35,056
[growling]

957
01:12:41,596 --> 01:12:43,598
Quick, let's get out of here!

958
01:12:57,678 --> 01:12:58,679
I think I've seen this.

959
01:12:58,713 --> 01:13:00,581
Hell no.

960
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:03,551
[clanging]

961
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:05,019
What's that?

962
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,621
[growling]

963
01:13:11,158 --> 01:13:13,661
Get down!

964
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:15,763
It's loose! Fire!

965
01:13:17,464 --> 01:13:20,167
[gunfire]

966
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,104
Over here!

967
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,506
Gonna tear the whole
ship apart!

968
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:29,442
<i>Boss!</i>
<i>The raptor is out of control!</i>

969
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:31,679
Get it under control.
Now.

970
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,886
This is what happens when
you leave things half done.

971
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:41,789
Oh, shit!

972
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:43,090
Devin, stay back!

[screaming]

01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,922
We need to
get to the wheelhouse,

978
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:16,489
take control of the ship.

979
01:14:16,524 --> 01:14:18,059
Agreed.

980
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:26,067
Smile, sweetie.

01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:35,977

[shouting]

985
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,696
Whoa!

986
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:05,272
Hey, hey, over here!

987
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:07,975
Hey!

988
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:09,143
What are you doing?

989
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:10,644
He's got Pete!
We have to distract him.

990
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:12,747
-This is his fault!
-He's still one of us!

991
01:15:14,015 --> 01:15:15,316
Let's do this.

992
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:16,784
-Hey!
-Hey!

993
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:19,620
-Hey!
-Hey! Over here!

994
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,289
-Come on! Come on!
-No, Marie! Run! Run!

995
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,758
Go, go, go!

996
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,928
You saved me.

997
01:15:27,962 --> 01:15:29,864
Yeah, don't make us regret it.

998
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:30,965
Guys, raptor!

999
01:15:30,998 --> 01:15:33,034
-Wheelhouse?
-Wheelhouse.

1000
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:41,842
Okay.

1001
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,255
Guys, these doors
better hold up.

1002
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:56,157
Yeah, but they won't
hold forever!

1003
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,925
We need a way out.

1004
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,127
Yeah? But what can we
do from here?

1005
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:03,097
We don't even have any weapons!

1006
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,632
If we crash the ship
into the dock,

1007
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:06,000
it should scare the raptor away.

1008
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:09,303
You know how to
steer one of these things?

1009
01:16:09,336 --> 01:16:10,871
We're about to find out.

1010
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:17,244
Oh!

1011
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:24,652
We're tilting.
Tilting!

1012
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,153
We know that!
We know that!

1014
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,798
Everybody okay?

1015
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,734
I need to get to
the failsafe console

1016
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:42,036
and detonate the explosives.

1017
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:44,105
Stop these dinosaurs
once and for all.

1018
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:48,943
No. Let me do this.

1019
01:16:48,976 --> 01:16:50,845
No, it's my lab.
It's my responsibility.

1020
01:16:50,878 --> 01:16:52,813
The raptor's only
got out because of me.

1021
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:55,716
It's my fault. The least I can
do is be the one to stop them.

1022
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:57,818
Five minutes.

1023
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:58,919
You promise me you'll be back.

1024
01:17:00,387 --> 01:17:01,789
Promise me!

1025
01:17:06,227 --> 01:17:07,795
In case I'm not.

1026
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:25,379
It's okay.
