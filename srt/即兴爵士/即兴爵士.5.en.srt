1
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,710
What the...?

2
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,760
Yoon...Seheon...?

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,550
Why are you here...?

4
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,840
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,430
You

6
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,640
Don’t play it

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Are you okay?

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
Don’t play it

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,900
the piano

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,270
Not again

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,900
I will play the piano

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,610
Then play it in front of me

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,120
Only in front of me

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,870
Hey, Taeyi!

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,080
What's wrong with you? Wake up

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,100
Why is he so heavy

17
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,320
Sleeping pills?

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,950
Hey, Taeyi, wake up!

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,240
How many of these did you take?

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,450
Hey, hey!

21
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,010
What?

22
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,340
I thought that...

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,050
I'm leaving

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,710
Who’s this? A friend?

25
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,420
They don't look similar if they are siblings...

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,850
Hey, you're not sleeping...?

27
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,880
Hey, get off me

28
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,420
It hurts

29
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,410
What are you dreaming about...

30
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,700
My dad will kill me

31
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,420
Are you going to jump?

32
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,300
Hey

33
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,060
Even if you jump, it’s just a dream

34
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,890
You're just waking up from a dream

35
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,600
Why did you do that?

36
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,320
The wind is nice

37
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
It looks like it's going to rain soon

38
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,830
Why did you leave without a word?

39
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,150
Listen

40
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,710
This is my favorite part

41
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,920
He always act in this way

42
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,230
Seheon?

43
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,870
Is he sleeping?

44
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:41,500
This music is...

45
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,090
Seheon

46
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,640
Why do you come more closer,

47
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,390
the more that I push?

48
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,230
If I'm being sloppy or what

49
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,900
I don't know now

50
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,330
I feel like I could easily sleep when I’m with you

51
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,930
Juhee!

52
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,430
Hey, Doyoon

53
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,730
What's up?

54
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,030
I'm sorry, I called you all of a sudden

55
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,070
No, it was not a bad timing

56
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,530
Huh?

57
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh, there is such a thing

58
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,750
Why did you call me?

59
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,750
Oh, that's...

60
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,340
What's wrong?

61
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,420
I actually saw it on that day

62
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,600
You saw what?

63
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,850
You... has...

64
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,560
Hey, that’s...

65
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,440
punched by my brother

66
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,190
Oh, that?

67
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,650
That's okay

68
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm sorry, Doyoon

69
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,150
I wanted to talk to Taeyi

70
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,790
I called you because I thought he might not like it

71
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,790
I don't even have a phone number of Seheon

72
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,670
What story?

73
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,170
I just wanted to apologize on behalf of my brother

74
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,840
No need to apologize

75
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,590
It wasn't your fault

76
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,890
It started because of me

77
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,350
I didn't realize it would be this big

78
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,560
I like Taeyi for no reason

79
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't let it bother you

80
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Forget about it

81
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,110
Please tell Taeyi, though,

82
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,530
that i’m sorry

83
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,580
Okay

84
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,120
I'll definitely do that

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,750
Are you okay with your bruise?

86
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,920
It's okay

87
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,630
Look at this

88
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,470
It's all better, not even bleeding anymore

89
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,640
And actually, his punch is not as powerful than I thought

90
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,790
It’s such a weak fist

91
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,910
I’m home

92
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,120
What time is it?

93
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,750
Sorry about that

94
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,920
Explain me what you've been doing until this time

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,670
I was practicing with my friends

96
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,050
Why didn’t you ask permission in advance?

97
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,220
I forgot

98
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,760
Forget?

99
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,850
It’s not an excuse for your age

100
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,430
Seheon Yoon

101
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,190
Look at me

102
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,440
Am I wrong?

103
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,560
Do you want to study at home again?

104
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,770
No

105
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,700
I'll do my best, dad

106
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,160
I’m not asking you to do as much as your brother

107
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,870
Until you get to the college that you want,

108
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,200
focus

109
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,710
Yes...

110
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,670
Get it done your practice

111
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,040
Hey prince, long time no see

112
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,290
Did you give him my password?

113
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,710
Change it up

114
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,420
What would you do when you get robbed

115
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,630
Who cares

116
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,220
But... You do look good, right?

117
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
But why do you look in that way, though?

118
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,560
What the heck, are you crazy after a few days off?

119
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,620
Hey, are you sleeping?

120
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,910
Hey, Doyoon

121
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,910
Are you sick?

122
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,920
No, I'm just a little tired

123
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,800
Is overwork contagious?

124
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,050
Did you catch it from Taeyi?

125
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,720
You left it

126
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,020
I totally forgot about that, thanks

127
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,190
What is it?

128
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,560
Huh?

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,730
What is it... You two?

130
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,730
What

131
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,950
You seem to be more closer while I was not there

132
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,780
Tell me

133
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,450
What did you two do yesterday?

134
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,870
Okay, class, let's get started

135
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,790
Everyone go to your seats

136
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,870
Tell me

137
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,830
Will you going to talk?

138
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,880
What did you do?

139
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Are you doing well with your group project?

140
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,670
Yes

141
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,170
No

142
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,880
Who said no?

143
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,090
And you all know that the due for submitting the list is today, right?

144
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes

145
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,310
All leaders must write down the part and the title of the song

146
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,640
Okay

147
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,980
So, let's look at page 29 of the textbook

148
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,360
Today’s class going to cover the law of harmony

149
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,610
You're not doing anything weird, are you?

150
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,070
It has started because of me

151
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,490
I must not be intimidated on the first day of practice

152
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,450
Keep it up

153
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,040
Seheon!

154
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,900
Is this what jazz is like?

155
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,940
What do you think, leader?

156
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,150
Leader? Am I the leader?

157
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,360
You picked the jazz, then you're the leader

158
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,490
That's how it works?

159
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,080
I have no idea

160
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,160
I can’t get a sense of the rhythm

161
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,580
We just did it for the first time today

162
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,170
If we keep practice and we’ll be okay

163
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,540
It’s the last day to submit the list

164
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,880
What about the last person to join?

165
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,880
Jungyu, do you know any friends?

166
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,970
Of course you won’t know

167
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,640
If there's a lot of people, give us just one

168
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,480
Taeyi

169
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,150
Taeyi Han? He told us not joining us

170
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,190
I'll talk to him

171
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,120
Is it okay?

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,080
I’m not joining

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,490
Why?

174
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,870
Because I don't want to

175
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,920
You like jazz, don't you?

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
You said you know well about jazz

177
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,380
You have a lot of jazz albums at home

178
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,250
Hey

179
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,630
Do you like going through other people’s house?

180
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,680
Why are you talking like that?

181
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,720
You seem to like jazz, so I’m asking you to join...

182
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,850
I’m not joining

183
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,180
What’s the reason?

184
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,600
A reason?

185
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,350
There's got to be a reason

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,150
Is it because you don't like the genre?

187
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,650
It’s because it’s foolish, okay?

188
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,200
Foolish?

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,280
I don't care about jazz or whatever

190
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
So you guys do it

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,760
You like jazz, don't you?

192
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,470
Did I ever like jazz?

193
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,930
Why do I hate it now?

194
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,270
You should be blow the trumpet, not wipe it

195
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,560
Since when...

196
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,620
You look cool

197
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,580
Look here, Taejoon!

198
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,590
Stop it, seriously

199
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,550
Why are you filming?

200
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,170
Because you film it, too

201
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Don’t do it

202
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,100
Look over there

203
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,340
Hello,

204
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,930
Yes, Seheon

205
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,890
Great, it must be hard to team up because you transferred

206
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,890
Yes

207
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,360
For rhythm, Doyoon and Jungyu...

208
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,860
Is Taeyi on this?

209
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,240
Yes

210
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm surprised

211
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,660
I was worried about Taeyi since he often misses group project

212
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,990
Good for him

213
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,290
Good luck

214
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,870
Okay

215
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,870
Thank you

216
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,050
How'd it go? What did she say?

217
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,800
She said good luck

218
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,720
Did you say Taeyi is joining us?

219
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,230
Did you?

220
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,940
What can I do

221
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,480
I can't screw up this project

222
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,400
But, did you write down the name of the student who said no?

223
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,160
I thought you were timid

224
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,290
But you're really bold for this kind of thing

225
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,800
First, let's practice on our own

226
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,710
Sure

227
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,140
It's okay, it's okay

228
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,140
Don’t hit your head against the wall

229
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,930
And so we started practicing without Taeyi

230
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,150
Everything hasn't been easy,

231
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,110
but we've got better

232
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,500
For Taeyi,

233
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,300
I couldn’t speak to him

234
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,970
And in the meantime

235
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,640
The time has passed quickly

236
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,220
What is it

237
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,730
I need to talk to you for a second

238
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,900
It’s tomorrow

239
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,190
It's not even a huge thing to do

240
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,070
You're just doing the thing whatever you want, now

241
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,370
Just come on the performance day

242
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,700
You don't have to do anything

243
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,290
Just stand there with an instrument

244
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,700
What it is so important?

245
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,790
What?

246
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,500
What's the meaning of this performance?

247
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,630
A meaning?

248
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,420
Am I wrong?

249
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,630
Do you want to study at home again?

250
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,430
At home,

251
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Do you know how it feels like you can’t even breathe?

252
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,310
Stop acting like you know everything when you know nothing

253
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,230
I'm so embarrassed...

254
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,440
I don't want it anymore

255
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,780
We don’t need you

256
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,160
We'll do just fine without you

257
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,290
So spend the rest of your life like that, running away

258
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,560
Seheon

259
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,060
Yeah

260
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,520
Are we screwed?

261
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,240
We should do it by ourselves, as we practiced

262
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,780
Taeyi... Isn't he coming?

263
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,740
I’m sorry, Jungyu

264
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,000
Because of me..

265
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,130
It’ll work, let’s do our best

266
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Good job

267
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,010
Next... Group 2

268
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,560
Let's go

269
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,710
Quiet

270
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,500
Why are there only three of you?

271
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
Where’s Taeyi?

272
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,510
He can’t make it

273
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:11,720
We’re sorry

274
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,470
You do know that teamwork counts on your grade, right?

275
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,930
Yes

276
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,690
Then, start

277
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,560
You fussed around that you’re not coming

278
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,100
Why did you come?

279
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,850
I'm here because I was afraid that I’m not going to pass

280
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,400
You’re being cocky

281
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,440
I’ll give you an excuse today

282
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,150
Help them organize the instruments

283
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,660
Okay, I’m coming

284
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,240
I'll talk to you later

285
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Hey

286
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,550
It’s just

287
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Anything to say?

288
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
I made a mistake...

289
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,310
See how you are

290
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,230
Because we have never practiced together before, that’s why

291
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,020
You said it like you'd never do it...

292
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,780
What are you doing here?

293
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,490
It has nothing to do with you

294
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,530
It's personal

295
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,030
I don't care, either

296
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,910
You pretend to be cool...

297
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,120
You're here for the grade, right?

298
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,080
Are you done?

299
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,880
Really you...!

300
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,260
That wasn't bad

301
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,640
What?

302
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,640
That wasn't so bad

303
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,810
Your performance

304
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,740
Yes,

305
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,080
I thought Seheon was only good at classical music,

306
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,630
but he is a big fan of jazz

307
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,050
I’m home

308
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,230
Seheon Yoon

309
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,190
Did you think that I would not know?

310
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,600
Dad, calm down

311
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,560
You think I sent you to school to do that thing?

312
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,940
Just tell him sorry, Seheon

313
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,490
What, a piano quartet?

314
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
Are you treating me like an idiot?

315
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:28,330
You have no right to be in this house!

316
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,160
Are you done?

317
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,120
Huh?

318
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,580
Seheon Yoon

319
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,630
You’re the one who does not deserve it

320
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,880
Are you...!

321
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,420
That's why mom ran away from you

322
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,010
Seheon...!

323
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,480
Father

324
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,940
Leave him alone

325
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,240
Leave him alone

326
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,980
Hey

327
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,570
What are you doing? It’s cold

328
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,570
Wait,

329
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,290
are you crying?

330
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:59,040
I have nowhere else to go

331
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm sorry

332
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,430
Let's go inside, get up
