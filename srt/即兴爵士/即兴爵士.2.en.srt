1
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,620
Nice!

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,600
Ah... I’m sleepy

3
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,940
I think it was too much to wake up at 5AM

4
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,220
You look good in your uniform

5
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,940
I know, right?

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,200
Don't be so nervous

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,820
Your classmates are nice

8
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,030
Okay

9
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,160
Shall we go in?

10
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,720
Silence, class

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,060
We have a new student here today

12
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,390
Would you briefly introduce yourself for us?

13
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,350
Okay

14
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,230
Hello

15
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,730
I’m here as a new student from today and my name is

16
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,940
Se-

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,530
-Heon

18
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,900
Yoon

19
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,370
You guys are making the new student very nervous

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,290
Seheon?

21
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,070
Yes?

22
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,370
Oh...

23
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,320
Oh, I'm Seheon Yoon!

24
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,260
Seheon is majoring in classical piano,

25
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
He's been doing the homeschooling for a long time,

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,260
so it is the first time for him to attend the arts high school

27
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
You guys can support him well to adjust in school, right?

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,640
Yes

29
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,350
Doyoon Suh!

30
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,430
Yes?

31
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,140
Seheon, you can sit next to him

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,190
Okay

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,940
Please remove the backpack for him

34
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,740
Hello?

35
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,910
Hey

36
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,070
My name is Doyoon

37
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,740
Nice to meet you

38
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,070
Is that a drum?

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,750
Yes

40
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,320
You’re right

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
It’s a snare drum

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,500
Can you show him around the school after class, Doyoon?

43
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,040
Okay, I will

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,380
Well, then, what were we studying about?

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,630
Today's lesson is...

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,510
The development of music in the Renaissance period

47
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,680
Music in the Renaissance period was very religious

48
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,940
And it was very focusing on combining the artistic beauty with it

49
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,270
Especially, it developed in the form of the church,

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
including chant and...

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,830
Hey

52
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,220
What the heck? You scared me

53
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,390
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,470
Playing house?

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,390
I was just doing my homework

56
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,470
But why?

57
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,020
What's that?

58
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,180
Come on

59
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,020
It’s so embarrassing

60
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,860
Are you going to give it to Taeyi?

61
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,950
Hey

62
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,570
Damn it

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,030
What you just saw is the nurse’s office

64
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,400
The cafeteria is all the way through the hallway

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,650
And the convenience store is at the back of the school

66
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,290
The gym, you have to walk 300 meters towards the northeast side

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,750
And you know the faculty room, right?

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,760
Do I need to let you know even the security office?

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,430
Oh yes, here it is

70
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,010
Hey, what are you doing over there?

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,350
What is this room for...?

72
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,100
As you can see it's a piano room

73
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,190
The room that I went yesterday didn’t look like this

74
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,360
Where is it?

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,610
It's a bit messy... With the old piano...

76
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,530
Oh you went to that haunted piano room?

77
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,200
Haunted?

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Yes, that an old piano room

79
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,330
There is a rumor to shut it down,

80
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,120
and it must not be managed well too

81
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,620
But the piano was fine

82
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,130
Is that so?

83
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,380
But there’s a rumor that the room is haunted

84
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,300
So nobody visit that place

85
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,130
As you know,

86
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,380
the appearance of the room is a bit...

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,340
No way, there is no ghost

88
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,560
Did you just say, “no way”?

89
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,600
I’m not sure whether I should tell you this

90
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,740
Students who passing by often hear some strange sound over there

91
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,910
A strange sound?

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,910
Is anybody out there?

93
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, hold on

94
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,670
What’s wrong?

95
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,420
Then that piano sound was...

96
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,670
I... I think I heard it

97
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,550
Huh?

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,350
You freaked me out!

99
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,440
I swear, when I stood in front of the door, the music has stopped

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,940
For real?

101
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,650
Obviously

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,530
Well, it’s an arts high school,

103
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,820
So there's a lot of kids practicing piano all over the place

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,370
You must have heard the wrong thing

105
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,580
Is it?

106
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,120
But that piano room,

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,330
It's not like we're banned to use it, right?

108
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,210
Well, it’s not technically banned

109
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,210
And it’s unmanged, right?

110
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,170
I told you

111
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,050
Nobody use that room

112
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,090
Taeyi!

113
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,470
Where have you been?

114
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,900
Are you friend with him?

115
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,020
Why?

116
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,530
Huh?

117
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,320
Just because

118
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,530
He is my boyfriend

119
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,610
Your boyfriend?

120
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,650
What are you thinking?

121
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,420
If your friend is a boy, then he is your boyfriend

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,330
Normally we just call them as friends

123
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
You are cute

124
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,630
His name is Taeyi Han

125
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,630
I’m kind of close to him

126
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,640
Does he play the piano too?

127
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,680
A little?

128
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,020
His major is a trumpet

129
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,690
A trumpet?

130
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,190
That punk plays the trumpet?

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,320
Did you fall in love with him?

132
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,990
Huh?

133
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,610
What?

134
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,950
You are staring at him

135
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,990
I asked, did you fell in love with him or not

136
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,620
What are you talking about? You are giving me goosebumps

137
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,620
What do you feel about?

138
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,540
About what?

139
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,080
About the piano

140
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,790
Are you good at playing the piano?

141
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,880
I don't think I'm that good...

142
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,970
What do you like other than classical music?

143
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,970
I like jazz music

144
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,640
A jazz music?

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,170
Yes

146
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:37,720
Like...

147
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,230
Like this kind of thing?

148
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,850
Yes

149
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,020
That can be considered as jazz too

150
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,730
That's unique

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,620
While I was thinking about the piano, I was totally forgot about something

152
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,830
The thing is, I don’t have any friend

153
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,510
Why?

154
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,970
What?

155
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,100
Are you care about the new student?

156
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,350
No I’m not

157
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,230
Poor guy, should we ask him to eat together?

158
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,790
He kept staring at you today

159
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,260
I heard that he likes jazz...

160
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,630
Did anyone ask you?

161
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,720
Not really

162
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,060
Why are you being so mean?

163
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,470
What are you so angry about?

164
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,530
Why is he looking at me like that?

165
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,120
Did he recognize that I snuck out the piano room this morning...?

166
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,880
Wait, teacher

167
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,170
Yes?

168
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,010
The piano room is full, so...

169
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,630
Is there any empty piano room?

170
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Did you make a reservation?

171
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,720
A reservation?

172
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,010
If you want to use it for other than practice purpose,

173
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,350
you have to make a reservation

174
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,350
If I make a reservation now, when will I get to use it?

175
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,900
Maybe in a month?

176
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,980
Huh? That long?

177
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,440
There are so many students using the piano room,

178
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
so we are always running out of room

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
You will have to practice at home for a while

180
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,160
You don’t have a piano at home?

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,450
Yes, I have it

182
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,040
But the thing is...

183
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,460
Thank you, anyways

184
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,080
Sure, take care

185
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,010
Alright, school is over guys

186
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,090
Thank you

187
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,430
Aren't you going home?

188
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,520
I will

189
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,900
Seheon

190
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,780
Huh?

191
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,110
See you tomorrow

192
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,530
Yeah, bye

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,290
Why are you being so nice to him?

194
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,840
Are you jealous?

195
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,170
Ouch

196
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,840
I get it, let go of me!

197
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,180
Hey, isn’t that Juhee?

198
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,720
Hey

199
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,270
You go first

200
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,890
But why?

201
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,270
Just make up any words

202
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,360
And about the birthday present, let’s call it even

203
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
Call it even?

204
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,280
Geez

205
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,420
Doyoon!

206
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,790
Oh, hey

207
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,590
Where is Taeyi?

208
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,970
Hmm... Oh, Taeyi

209
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,430
He left first

210
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,100
Oh really?

211
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,260
But why didn't I see him...

212
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,930
Why?

213
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,270
Nothing

214
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,060
See you

215
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,560
Alright

216
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, I’m heading this way

217
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,150
Bye

218
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,610
Goodbye

219
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,390
No one goes there

220
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,970
because there is a rumor that it’s haunted

221
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,820
Hello?

222
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,770
I'm not afraid of ghosts

223
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm more afraid of that I won’t be able to play the piano

224
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,770
He will never come back around this time

225
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,080
What should I play then?

226
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,530
I have already warned you

227
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,080
That I'll kill you if you play the piano here again

228
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,880
You don’t really listen to me, right?

229
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,840
Don’t you think it’s wrong?

230
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,760
What?

231
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,430
I heard that no one uses this room

232
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,180
You are so stubborn

233
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,350
I even use it after school

234
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,230
You were here in the morning too, right?

235
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,610
Like a rat

236
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,110
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

237
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,860
Just get the hell out of here no matter it’s a morning or a night

238
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,740
Then at least give me a good reason why I shouldn't be here!

239
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,830
If I smash the piano, will you never come back?

240
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,420
Are you mad?

241
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,460
Listen,

242
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,250
whatever as you understand,

243
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,880
there’s only a single choice

244
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,130
Get the hell out

245
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,050
Understood?

246
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,930
No

247
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,220
What?

248
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,680
I said I don’t understand

249
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,810
You really bother me

250
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,860
Get off me, it hurts!

251
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,190
It won’t just hurt

252
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,110
It’s not a thing that breaking your wrists

253
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,660
What the hell is wrong with you? Just tell me the reason

254
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,950
Shut up

255
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,330
Then just break it

256
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,170
I could even die to play the piano

257
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,840
Yes, I like it

258
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,420
That I could die for this

259
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,640
Get off me

260
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm sorry...

261
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,180
But why did you...

262
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,060
Hey, don't act like this

263
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,070
What are you guys doing out there?

264
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,540
I came in to practice because there were no room

265
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,540
But he just started to grab me and push

266
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,460
Grab and push you?

267
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,710
Yes

268
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,050
And then we went like this...

269
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,510
And this...

270
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,880
And I climbed up on him

271
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,220
Climbed him up?

272
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,180
Yes?

273
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,680
Well...

274
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,390
Then he just jumped on top of me

275
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,560
Just shut up

276
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,020
Jumped on the top of you

277
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,940
Well I didn’t lie

278
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,570
I’m leaving

279
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,450
Well, well

280
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,780
The conversation is not over yet

281
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,280
And then what happened?

282
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,410
Well... It’s not as the weird thing you think

283
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,620
But the situation was...

284
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,960
Well, it’s interesting

285
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,590
What is your name?

286
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,510
Seheon Yoon

287
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,720
Oh, Seheon Yoon?

288
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,350
Okay, you’re free to go

289
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,060
Pardon?

290
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,270
I said you can leave

291
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,640
I have something to talk with him

292
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,400
Oh, okay

293
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,750
I've been looking for you

294
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,380
You ignored Juhee so I was wondering where you are heading

295
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,540
And, look at you...

296
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,130
Well, it’s so interesting

297
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,220
That’s enough

298
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,300
My sister was up all night to make something for you

299
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,720
She must be sad if she find this out

300
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,680
I’m leaving

301
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,650
Do not act up, Taeyi

302
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,110
Put your hands away

303
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,280
Hey, Taeyi

304
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,700
If...

305
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,200
If my sister starts to cry, mentioning your name

306
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,670
I can’t stand then anymore

307
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,750
You get what I mean?

308
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,170
And Seheon?

309
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,350
Well, he is cute

310
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,010
I was bored since I came back to school

311
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,600
Thanks to him, I'll have fun

312
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Do whatever you want

313
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,130
Give me your hands

314
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,260
What are you doing? Why your hands look like this?

315
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,260
As a pianist, you should consider your hands as your life

316
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,840
I just bumped into something

317
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,600
How’s school?

318
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
It’s good

319
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,520
I also have friends there

320
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,900
It's not like what you think!

321
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,360
I’m popular in school

322
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,530
Don’t be too excited

323
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,320
Of course

324
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,950
If you hang out with your friends,

325
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,530
that means you'll have less time to practice

326
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,410
Friends..

327
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,250
To earn something,

328
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,830
you have to give up something else

329
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,670
I know it too

330
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,510
I've heard that for a long time

331
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,300
It’s done, how do you feel?

332
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,800
Good enough

333
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,060
Don't practice today, just take a rest

334
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,890
Okay

335
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,280
It was the first day of school,

336
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
and things went out of control

337
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,960
But what is the reason...

338
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,130
Don’t act like this

339
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,750
That he overreacts in this way?

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Is everything going to be alright?

341
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,010
Taeyi Han

342
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,220
Why do I feel sympathy on him?

343
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,810
He is such a jerk

344
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I’m so annoyed

345
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,150
Take it slow

346
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,820
That’s it

347
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,870
Hey, Juha!

348
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,990
Hello

349
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,950
Can I join?

350
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,660
Sure

351
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,540
It's been such a long time

352
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,640
Doyoon Suh!

353
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,010
Why aren’t you defend well?

354
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,890
Okay, i will

355
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,570
You’re so annoying

356
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,320
Hey, take it slow

357
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,450
It's a foul, right?

358
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,040
Give him a free throw for him

359
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,790
Hey

360
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,380
Hey, Taeyi!

361
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,510
I need to talk to you

362
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,360
Why?

363
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,860
Just to be clear,

364
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,580
I'm still going to play the piano there

365
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,830
You're not going to tell me the reason anyway

366
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,920
Whatever you want

367
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
What?

368
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,670
If you’re done, I’m leaving

369
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,420
Hey wait a second!

370
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,050
At least you should tell me the reason what bothered you!

371
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,680
Must I tell you the reason for you?

372
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,640
Of course! You’re being ridiculous

373
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,180
You threatened me all of a sudden, telling me not to play the piano,

374
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,810
and now you want me to do whatever I want?

375
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,900
I don’t want to listen

376
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,400
Huh?

377
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,650
I don’t like your piano performance

378
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,410
What do you think you know?

379
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,700
Did you even listened to it closely?

380
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Are you confident?

381
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,080
Of course I am, who do you think -

382
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,700
Then play it

383
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,790
What?

384
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,330
I said, play it

385
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,630
I will listen to it closely

386
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,010
It’s not what I expected

387
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,010
What happened suddenly..

388
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,430
If you stare me like that

389
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,940
How am I supposed to play..

390
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,070
Hey, you’re not going to play it?

391
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,490
It.. seems like you don’t like jazz

392
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,780
Do you want to request a song, or,

393
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,620
have a favorite song?

394
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,960
Whatever you feel confident

395
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,670
Then.. Shall I begin...?

396
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,550
How do you think?

397
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,350
Huh? How did you listen?

398
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,360
As I expected…

399
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,490
I don’t like it

400
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,490
Say that again?

401
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,580
It’s not good

402
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,130
Hey, hold on!

403
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,460
Is that all?

404
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,420
Do as you like

405
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,380
Now it doesn’t matter

406
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,090
whether you are going to play the piano here or not

407
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,390
Hey!

408
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,220
They definitely look similar

409
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,560
Is that possible..?

410
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,140
Or I’m just out of my mind

411
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,560
How do you think?

412
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,020
I don’t like it

413
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,230
Do whatever you want

414
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,480
because now it doesn’t matter anymore

415
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,400
I lied

416
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,370
To be honest,

417
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,540
I wanted to listen to it for more

418
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,510
Everyone, sociocultural phenomena

419
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,550
are caused by the complex interaction of society and culture

420
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,720
And they have a variety of characteristics

421
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,140
The five main characteristics of sociocultural phenomena are

422
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,440
first complexity,

423
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,570
second diversity, third variability,

424
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,820
fourth, interrelatedness, and fifth, social meaning

425
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,870
Now, there are divided meanings of complexity,

426
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,790
such as the interactions of members of a society

427
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,880
And when I say members of society,

428
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
it could be you or...

429
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,010
You’re not eating?

430
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,170
I don’t feel like it

431
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,550
Do I have to feed you?

432
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,260
Come on

433
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,350
My husband,

434
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,470
Open your mouth

435
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,810
Stop it

436
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,900
The weather is already low pressure, why are you even low?

437
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,650
Why isn't Seheon coming to school?

438
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,820
Stop talking about him, I’m not interested in

439
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,610
Well, you are

440
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,320
You've been staring at his empty seat this whole morning

441
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,830
Did I?

442
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,450
Yes, I saw you

443
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,120
Take your time, I’m leaving right now

444
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,170
He is weird today

445
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,970
Seheon Yoon

446
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:39,890
Why do I

447
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,400
care about him

448
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,560
Should I stop playing?

449
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,360
You’re cute, Seheon

450
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,190
Hey, what are you going?

451
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,570
Just stay still

452
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,570
It hurts..

453
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,780
Please…
