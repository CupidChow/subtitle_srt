1
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,830
Please stop

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,090
You're crossing the line

3
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,260
If I cross the line,

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,980
and then what happens?

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,610
What the heck?

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,620
You are a wacko

7
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,350
In any form

8
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,720
Every love has a beginning

9
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,360
Hey, don’t act up

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,650
It may be a childish and boring memory

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,190
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,160
If you ask me the most important first memory...

13
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,740
It seems like he is our school’s student

14
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,080
Get lost, you idiot

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,040
It was Juha

16
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,580
He was the one that everyone was afraid of

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,090
But not me

18
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,460
Hey you

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,630
Get out of here before they get up

20
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,970
It's not just because he saved me

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,100
Maybe I'm the only one who knows...

22
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,230
For the first time, I felt the warmth in his atmosphere

23
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,650
I visited him again because I wanted to be close to him a little more

24
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,900
Hey, excuse me

25
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,610
Can I join you?

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,370
What grade are you in?

27
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,120
Although he didn't recognize me

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,250
I’m a freshman

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,410
You don't look like you can play the basketball well

30
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,620
It was fine

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,920
You will only going to pass on to me

33
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,380
Okay

34
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,500
I could start all over again

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,440
But...

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,900
He has changed again

37
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,940
Please, take this

38
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,150
Ever since Juhee starts to like Taeyi

39
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,820
Juhee was the one and only family that Juha got

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,700
Taeyi acted in the same manner as always

41
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,120
Do you want to die?

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,950
Just punch me

43
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,070
He aroused him even more

44
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,570
Taeyi didn’t afraid of to be punched

45
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,920
What up?

46
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,710
Why are you so moody?

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm thinking about you

48
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,300
Like an idiot,

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,970
I couldn't hate him

50
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,350
Even though I knew that he was utilizing me

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,070
Are you sure you are not bullied by anyone?

52
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,860
I just fell when I play the basketball

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,030
It's okay

54
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,950
In fact,

55
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,040
From the first moment he gave me his hands

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,540
I didn't want anyone to know

57
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,700
That I like him

58
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,940
Is Taeyi not here yet?

59
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,730
Hey, Doyoon!

60
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,230
Huh?

61
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,990
Is Taeyi not here -

62
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,990
What's wrong with your face?

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,030
Oh, it’s...

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,620
Did Juha punch you?

65
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,370
No he didn’t

66
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,490
I bumped into something while playing the basketball

67
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,700
Really?

68
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes, I was slamming a dunk

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,920
A dunk shot?

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,790
You do that too?

71
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,300
What happened with Juha yesterday?

72
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,680
Uh, that's...

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,180
It’s shocking

74
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,640
I must have misunderstand something

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,270
What happened in the piano room was really shocking, too

76
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,400
Most of all, the fact that you thought that Taeyi and Juha were dating -

77
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Well, it could be misunderstand

78
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,240
Yuck, it’s disgusting

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,910
Sorry

80
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,330
It's okay

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,040
You are just a weird kid

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,540
Then.. Why Taeyi is...

83
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,040
Apologize to him

84
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,550
I think he helped you because he worried that you will be bullied by Juha

85
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,010
Is that so?

86
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,470
I told you

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,930
to stay away from Juha

88
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,720
That's why he told me not to use the piano room,

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
and he always staring at me like...

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,060
Wait, but is he usually being angry all the time?

91
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,560
A little

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,610
But it's true that it got worse since you've came here

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,690
Why?

94
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,150
I don't know, go ask him

95
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,030
If I go and ask him,  he will be like

96
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,700
Get lost, Seheon

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,280
This is it!

98
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,450
What’s that reaction?

99
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,950
I don’t know, either

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,450
Let's go back inside

101
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,410
Yeah

102
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,710
How do you feel these days, Taeyi?

103
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,720
Uh, just...

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,260
I can't sleep

105
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,430
Are you dreaming again?

106
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,180
Yes

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,850
What kind of dream? Can you tell me?

108
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,900
My brother is...

109
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,370
playing the piano

110
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,150
Just like it used to be,

111
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,460
everything is natural

112
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,170
and peaceful

113
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,510
Suddenly, I feel anxious and foreign

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,010
When I feel those feelings,

115
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,480
My heart starts to pound like it’s crazy

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,150
And it disappears

117
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,280
When you started to dream,

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,780
Did you notice anything different?

119
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,790
Like new events or people?

120
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,460
There's a new kid in my class...

121
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,670
A transferred student

122
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,750
What is the connection between dream and him?

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,550
They're similar

124
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,420
Similar with Taejoon?

125
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,340
But how?

126
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,800
The way they play the piano

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
And also the way they talk

128
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,230
Also the preferences

129
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,980
Do you have any specific feelings for him?

130
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,730
What kind of feelings to you expect me to have?

131
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,120
I think that's enough for today

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,700
I'll give you a week's supply of medication

133
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,540
Don’t take pills too often, only when you can’t sleep, alright?

134
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,630
Okay

135
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,090
I’m full

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,140
Yes, I liked sausages

137
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,550
Sausage is always the best

138
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,550
Anyways, you didn’t team up with anybody, right?

139
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,730
Yes

140
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,270
Do you want to join me?

141
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,980
With you? What about Taeyi?

142
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,530
I'll try to convince him

143
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,530
If he says no, we'll find another friend

144
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,620
By the way, why he not coming to school yet?

145
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,170
What are you scared about? He's gone

146
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,930
I thought he is going to scold me...

147
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,390
Thank God

148
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,930
You go to class first

149
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,850
I’ll meet some friends

150
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,680
Got it

151
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,660
Apologize to him

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,120
I think he helped you because he worried that you will be bullied by Juha

153
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,140
Hey

154
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,140
Hey you’re here

155
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,190
Yes

156
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,940
Yesterday…

157
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,860
I was…

158
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,110
Come

159
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,740
Huh?

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,280
Follow me

161
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,130
Why did you bring me here?

162
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,130
Come on in

163
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you going to hit me?

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,430
Why would I hit you

165
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,240
Play it

166
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,660
What?

167
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,870
Play anything

168
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,240
Now?

169
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,410
Yes

170
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,450
You’re going to say that I’m bad

171
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,580
Shut up and just play it

172
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll just listen

173
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,230
Then I’ll play just a random one

174
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,660
I don’t feel specific feelings

175
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,170
It's all just the same song

176
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,060
Does he even know the meaning of this song?

177
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,070
Are you sleeping?

178
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,170
What has he been up to

179
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,720
It’s because of you

180
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,640
I’m curious

181
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,850
What is because of me

182
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,490
I want to know a little more

183
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,620
Taeyi Han

184
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,720
What's wrong with him?

185
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,020
Hey, Doyoon, did you do something wrong?

186
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,910
Are you up?

187
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,500
Drink this

188
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,720
It helps you to wake you up, isn’t it?

189
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,390
Yes it is

190
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,470
Right? And it also tastes good

191
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,440
Hey, I want to apologize

192
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,820
About what?

193
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,740
That I misunderstood about Juha and you

194
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I found out yesterday after you left

195
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,960
I thought that he’s a good guy

196
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
But he's not

197
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm sorry

198
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,920
I should've realized that when you took me out of karaoke

199
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,720
Is that why you didn't let me come here, right?

200
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,300
You were afraid of Juha would come after me?

201
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,850
That’s…

202
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,600
Nothing

203
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,690
Just say something

204
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,440
I can’t help to misunderstand because you were so angry

205
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
If you have time to thinking about that,

206
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,940
you’d better playing the piano harder

207
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm practicing hard,

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,780
if someone didn’t interrupt!

209
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,200
Why are you playing the jazz?

210
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,830
It's actually the first time that I've played it after I came to this school

211
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,630
What?

212
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,000
My parents never let me play at home

213
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,630
I've always played it in my head

214
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,880
It's the first time I've ever played it

215
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,340
I knew it

216
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,350
Why!

217
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,180
You looked like a beginner

218
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,930
It was sloppy and unnatural

219
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,900
Then tell me

220
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,230
Which point do I look like a beginner?

221
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,700
You're scared of making a mistake, aren't you?

222
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,950
Huh?

223
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,750
You're afraid of making mistakes because I can feel it

224
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,080
That you are trying hard not to hit the wrong note

225
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,880
When did you get here?

226
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,470
Hey

227
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,350
What's wrong with your face?

228
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,430
It happened while I was playing basketball

229
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,090
Is that true?

230
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,590
Yes, it is

231
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,440
Juha is the one who did this, right?

232
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,440
Hey, don't

233
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,350
Why?

234
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,240
I'll handle this

235
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,240
What's wrong even with you?

236
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,240
I heard everything from Seheon

237
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,360
Heard what?

238
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,250
Everything from the piano room to karaoke

239
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,830
Why didn't you talk to me first?

240
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,460
So, I was thinking about doing this group project with Seheon

241
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,420
What?

242
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
Because you’re being mean

243
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,300
What are you going to do? There's one seat left

244
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,970
I’m not joining, find someone else

245
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,950
You

246
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,410
You are afraid of making a mistake, right?

247
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,710
How... Did he know?

248
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,130
You're afraid of making mistakes because I can feel it

249
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,010
Because I become anxious

250
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,630
when I hit the wrong note

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,500
Do you think he influences you just because they're similar?

252
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,880
Aren’t you have any specific feelings for him?

253
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,720
Are you up?

254
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,850
Is it really because of Seheon?

255
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,190
No matter how many pills I take

256
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,690
I can't sleep

257
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,160
Hello?

258
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,930
Taeyi won't be joining us

259
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:51,100
Oh, I see... What should we do then?

260
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,730
We need two more people

261
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,900
I've already arranged for one

262
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,150
Who is that?

263
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,730
It's Jungyu

264
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,030
Jungyu?

265
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,030
Yeah, it wasn't easy

266
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,370
Then let's start practicing today

267
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,120
Today?

268
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes

269
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,540
We haven't even submitted the list yet and we're starting off from today?

270
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,160
Then how about tomorrow?

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,290
Oh, you're serious

272
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,170
I want to do it well

273
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,800
I don't think we should start practicing today

274
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,220
Let's just say meet Jungyu first

275
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,100
Okay

276
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,270
Let’s eat

277
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,060
Hurry up

278
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,650
Wait, wait, wait.

279
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,900
Why do we have to meet here?

280
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,190
I’m anxious...

281
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,320
You're a pretty a coward, aren't you?

282
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,070
I always practice here alone

283
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,870
My grandmother told me not to go to a place like a haunted house...

284
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,160
It's all rumors, come on

285
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,200
What about the cobwebs?

286
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,210
How is it?

287
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,550
It’s better than you thought, right?

288
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,590
I already cleaned everything up

289
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,640
You cleaned the room?

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,220
It smells weird

291
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,810
Do we even have electricity here?

292
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,400
Yikes!

293
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,480
Did you really clean up the space?

294
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,860
Why is it there?

295
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,530
Say hello anyway

296
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,700
This is Jungyu, Jungyu Kim

297
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,540
He is a bass major

298
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,000
Nice to meet you

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,210
You too, I’m Seheon Yoon

300
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,000
Is that all? Just the three of us?

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,540
We still must get one

302
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,630
Do you guys have a song in mind?

303
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,590
Just something exciting?

304
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,760
How about Beethoven?

305
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,390
Not again

306
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,060
We get good grades when we do the classical music

307
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,860
What do you think?

308
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
A hip-hop?

309
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,230
Hip-hop? Is that okay for the performance project?

310
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,570
Why not? Some students are doing punk or pop

311
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Then... What about jazz?

312
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,490
A jazz?

313
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,290
Can we play jazz?

314
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,410
I've never played a jazz before

315
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,120
Have you ever played a jazz ensemble?

316
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,080
Huh?

317
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,090
In fact,

318
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,010
I've also never played an ensemble before...

319
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,470
I have! Trust me!

320
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,810
Oh, really?

321
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,190
Then I'll find a song that suits

322
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,610
You'll bring the score too, right?

323
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,770
A score?

324
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,490
We’re new to jazz, so we’ll need a score

325
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,820
I'll bring that one, too.

326
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,030
Okay, then how about we start practicing on Thursday?

327
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,830
It’s good

328
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,910
Okay, let’s do it

329
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,170
I feel like this is going to be good, right?

330
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,000
He can even use a jazz score, too

331
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
He's amazing

332
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,630
What's wrong with your face?

333
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,570
It has passed 2 days after Taeyi passed out

334
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,740
Is he alright?

335
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,450
I'm worried

336
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,840
Can you contact Taeyi?

337
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,170
No

338
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,260
He ignored my texts, and now his cell phone is off

339
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,680
Are you worried?

340
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,390
Aren’t you?

341
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,440
He just overworked

342
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,110
I asked his uncle and he said he is fine at home

343
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,740
Do you even know his uncle?

344
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,450
Yeah, I've met him once, at his shop

345
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,910
What shop?

346
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,030
A jazz bar

347
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,120
What, a jazz bar?

348
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,500
Yes

349
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,710
It’s unexpected

350
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,880
Shall we visit?

351
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,960
To the bar?

352
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,010
What are you talking about? Taeyi's home

353
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,840
Go visit

354
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,050
Will you come with me?

355
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,930
Wait, with me?

356
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,730
You said you're worried

357
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,110
Hey, come on

358
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,780
Quickly

359
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,920
Is he sleeping?

360
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,220
Are you sure it’s here?

361
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,840
A hundred percent

362
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,180
Who’s here?

363
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,020
Isn't this Taeyi's house?

364
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,650
No it’s not

365
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,490
Was it the different floor? I'm confused

366
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,450
What the...

367
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,990
Why are you looking at me like that? I might be confused

368
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,200
Let’s go to another one

369
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,670
It's too hot

370
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,460
A hundred percent sure this time

371
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,250
Hey

372
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,920
Weren't you just dreaming about it?

373
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,130
No, I didn't

374
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,760
Where is this... Ouch!

375
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,970
Anyway, isn't the weather so nice?

376
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,300
Are we in the right place...?

377
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,390
It's a hundred percent

378
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,720
How many times is this..

379
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,560
I thought this was the right place...

380
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,810
It’s weird

381
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,060
Hey

382
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm thirsty

383
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,690
Taeyi house’s water is really good

384
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,440
I don't think there should be water

385
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,200
Have you seen the house that doesn't have water?

386
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,870
It is weird

387
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,920
It's definitely here

388
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,590
He can't have moved

389
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,710
Well..

390
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,300
I have to go soon

391
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,640
It’s around here

392
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,520
There it is

393
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Are you really sure?

394
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,690
A hundred percent

395
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,570
You said it was a hundred percent before too

396
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,620
But I’m sure this time

397
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,160
Let's go

398
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,750
Quickly

399
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,920
What's wrong?

400
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,050
Sorry, I should go first

401
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,510
Hey

402
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,840
It's on the fourth floor of this building, one, two, three, four

403
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,430
What?

404
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,260
The password for Taeyi's home

405
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,300
Why do you tell me that?

406
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,640
If he doesn't respond, we should go in

407
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,930
What if he’s dead?

408
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,390
What?

409
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,430
I'm just kidding

410
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,980
Call me when you meet Taeyi, I'm leaving!

411
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,900
Hey!

412
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,220
It’s not even here?

413
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,600
If he doesn't respond, we should go in

414
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,770
What if he’s dead?

415
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,530
No!

416
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,410
If it opens...

417
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,700
This must be Taeyi's house

418
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,340
It’s opened!

419
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,980
Are these Taeyi's shoes...?

420
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,940
Is he home..?

421
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,110
Is anybody here?

422
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,290
Who is it..
