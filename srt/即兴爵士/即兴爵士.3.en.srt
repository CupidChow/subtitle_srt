1
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,940
Hello?

2
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,860
Oh, you’re here

3
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,530
Are you alone?

4
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,160
Yes

5
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,080
What about Taeyi?

6
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,000
I don’t know

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,630
I just came

8
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,420
You just came?

9
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,750
I went to the hospital

10
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,670
because of my hands

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,340
I see

12
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,680
I didn’t introduce myself last time

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,850
I’m Juha

14
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,140
Juha Song

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,180
Juha..

16
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,470
Just call me bro

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,470
It’s alright

18
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,690
Okay

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,830
Are you good at piano?

20
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,460
I don’t think I am that good

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,080
Why are you not confident?

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,510
Which genre do you like?

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,630
Classical music?

24
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,720
Rather than a classical music..

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
I prefer jazz

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,350
Oh jazz

27
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,810
I like jazz too

28
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,310
Do you?

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,560
Sure

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,310
That’s a relief

31
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,400
I thought that I’m a weirdo

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:35,940
Why?

33
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,150
I thought that I would have a tons of friends like me

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,950
in the arts high school

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,660
But it seems like it’s only me

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,910
I see

37
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,250
Which one do you like?

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,670
I don’t know

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,590
Would you play it for me?

40
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,760
Now?

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,300
Yes, I want to listen to it

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,930
With your favorite one

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,030
Should I stop playing?

44
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,530
You’re cute, Seheon

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,870
Juha

46
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,330
I told you, call me a bro

47
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,330
Why are you do this?

48
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,620
Just stay still

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
It’s..

50
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,000
What did I do?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,630
It hurts.. Please…

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,510
You’re here

53
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,640
Your performance is pretty good

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,730
even with your injured hands

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,940
By the way, what is the title of this song?

56
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,440
It’s Sas..

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,400
It’s a Sasquatch

58
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
Oh is that so?

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,530
Just as I expected, you guys got a great chemistry

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,650
Seheon

61
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,290
Thank you for the performance today

62
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,170
Would you play it for me next time too, will you?

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,750
Sure

64
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,590
See you

65
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,770
Want to talk?

66
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,530
I found him fascinating

67
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,830
His performance is good either

68
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,040
He deserves your attention

69
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,050
You need to learn how to act

70
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,800
You don’t have to lie about it, because I already knew it

71
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,050
You look like you would snatch him in any moment

72
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,720
If you’re done, I’m leaving

73
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,720
Taeyi

74
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,610
Do as you want

75
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,110
It’s not my business

76
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,900
For real?

77
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,430
Why did he come in at the very moment..

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,110
He looked furious

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,650
But why?

80
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,620
What made him so angry about?

81
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,950
I have no clue…

82
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Taeyi..

83
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,140
Aren’t you an outsider..?

84
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,890
Pardon?

85
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,690
Were you the student here?

86
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,860
I told you back then

87
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,860
As you’re here..

88
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,150
Are you a sophomore?

89
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,610
Which class?

90
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,780
Class 1

91
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,750
Then could you please call Taeyi?

92
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,460
Taeyi?

93
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,380
He’ll know me as you mention Juhee Song

94
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,340
Huh?

95
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,060
The ads keep popping up

96
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,190
Your girlfriend ask me to call you

97
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,190
Are you dating with somebody without telling me?

98
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,150
What a joke

99
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,030
She says her name is.. Juhee

100
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,780
Geez.. Juhee Song?

101
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,780
She is not my girlfriend

102
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,670
Hey, sit down, sit down, sit down

103
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,250
Why..?

104
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,420
Is that what she said?

105
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,220
That she's Taeyi's girlfriend?

106
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,540
No

107
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,720
That's just what I said

108
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,420
Why?

109
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,390
Because she just looked like his girlfriend

110
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,600
Really?

111
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,270
Did she look like Taeyi’s girlfriend?

112
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,060
If she’s not, she’s not

113
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,900
Why are you so excited about that?

114
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,690
Who’s Juhee?

115
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,610
She is Juha's little sister in the junior year

116
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,360
who is really scary

117
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Juha?

118
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Huh?

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,950
Juha Song?

120
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you know him?

121
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,790
Oh, it’s a bit complicated...

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,500
So what’s the relationship with Juhee?

123
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,090
Oh.. He and Taeyi’s relationship is a bit tensed

124
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,960
Because Juhee likes Taeyi

125
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,300
Then, why they’re not in a relationship?

126
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,010
Because Taeyi is not into Juhee

127
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,140
Then who does he into?

128
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,270
Why are you curious about?

129
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,400
Well, I’m not!

130
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
What is it?

131
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,820
Oh, it's a chocolate

132
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,700
I made it for you

133
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,660
Why?

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,530
Sorry?

135
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,540
Oh.. It was actually a birthday present

136
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,500
But I couldn’t get a chance to give you

137
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,340
So I made a new one

138
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,670
Please take it

139
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,760
I know it's late, but happy birthday

140
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,850
Don't come to my classroom from now on

141
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,150
I don’t want to be misunderstood

142
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,320
But if you can… Stay away from Juha

143
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,700
Why?

144
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,290
For various reasons, there is no benefit at all

145
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,830
He doesn't seem like a bad guy

146
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,250
Just listen to me

147
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,290
okay?

148
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,960
Hold on,

149
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,380
Probably it’s because Taeyi...

150
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,430
likes him..!?

151
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,350
Yes, it was weird!

152
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,520
What’s wrong with you?

153
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,980
Move

154
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,520
Huh?

155
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh, okay

156
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,450
How did it go?

157
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,070
Went what?

158
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,280
Take this

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,290
What’s this?

160
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,660
I don’t know

161
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,790
It’s chocolate

162
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,290
Why are you giving me this?

163
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,500
Then just throw it away

164
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,710
Just eat a single piece

165
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,670
I don’t want to

166
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,880
Then let's take a selfie as a proof

167
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,300
One, two!

168
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,880
Damn it

169
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,760
Please take a seat

170
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Silence

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,220
Before we call the roll,

172
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,060
you know that our music class

173
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,640
has an ensemble practice coming up, right?

174
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,310
Yes

175
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,270
Ensemble practice?

176
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,890
We’re going to have at least 4 people in groups

177
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,560
so that there's no person overlapping

178
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,860
And of course, it’s included in the evaluation

179
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,030
I’m screwed up

180
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,740
Give me your group and the member list within this week, understood?

181
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,410
Group assignments like this sudden?

182
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,080
So let's see the page 25

183
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,160
Who should I team up with?

184
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,000
The Birth of Baroque Music

185
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,180
Hey..

186
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,430
Hi!

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,020
You guys were all here!

188
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,480
I really like this one too

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,860
We’re such a team

190
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,490
Do you have your group -

191
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,150
We’re sorry

192
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,030
...members?

193
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,490
Maybe you have

194
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,620
Ta-da

195
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,120
You must be thirsty

196
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,170
Do you want to drink?

197
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,090
Do you want to team up with me?

198
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,670
What's your part?

199
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,680
I’m in charge of piano!

200
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,890
What can we do?

201
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,390
We already have a piano...

202
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,930
I see...

203
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,850
Can you play any other instruments?

204
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,230
No, I only play piano

205
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,780
Probably you should find another group...

206
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,990
Other group has already...

207
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,580
Do you want to team up with me?

208
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,240
What's your MBTI type?

209
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,080
IS...

210
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,160
No

211
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,790
We’re all extroverts

212
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,080
I’m almost half and half

213
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,880
It’s even worse

214
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,380
We're going to play the rock music

215
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,340
The rock music?

216
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,800
Do you know how to do the headbanging?

217
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,890
Isn’t that just shaking my head?

218
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,890
Then shake it

219
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,810
Like this?

220
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,270
It looks like a traditional Korean dance

221
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,110
Yeah, I'll join you

222
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,440
Really?

223
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,780
What's your part?

224
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,900
I'm Juliet

225
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,820
Huh?

226
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,490
Juliet?

227
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,870
I'm Juliet from Romeo and Juliet

228
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,660
Don't you know?

229
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,370
What does that mean...?

230
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,120
Don't you have an instrument you can play?

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,330
An instrument?

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,670
I'm an acting major

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,800
I already asked everybody

234
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,260
Sorry, let's do it together next time

235
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,510
Hey, i’ll take the milk

236
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,430
Also this one!

237
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,640
Hey

238
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,900
Seheon can't seem to find members

239
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,820
Shall we help him?

240
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
What?

241
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,080
We don't also have anybody else besides you and me

242
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,910
Why are you always being so nice to him?

243
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,410
Because he is poor

244
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,790
He is just a new student

245
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,620
But doesn't seem to be adjusting well

246
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,790
Just don’t mind him

247
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,420
What’s wrong with you?

248
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,050
You always get so excited when we talk about Seheon

249
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,510
I didn’t...

250
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,090
I love to listen to your performance

251
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,220
Will you play it again next time for me?

252
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,180
Yeah

253
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,810
Isn’t it?

254
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:59,770
That’s enough

255
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,900
If you think he is poor, then go ahead and pair up with him

256
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,740
I can’t understand

257
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,790
Hey

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,930
Don't you dare to be in that room

259
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,020
What?

260
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,850
I said don't go there

261
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,360
Not again

262
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,980
What?

263
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,360
You told me to do whatever I want

264
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,650
Why do you blow hot and cold like this

265
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,530
Just listen to me

266
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,160
Why should I listen to you?

267
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,700
I warned you clearly

268
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,990
A warning?

269
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,580
Are you going to grab me like this again?

270
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,710
You stupid

271
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,830
Stop swearing and tell me why

272
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,710
I'll do it or not do it when I understand

273
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,090
Just shut up and do what I told you

274
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,170
You can't be serious

275
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,300
Is it because of Juha?

276
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,470
What?

277
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,470
You're embarrassed, so it's true

278
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,140
Don't you have a crush on him?

279
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,850
What are you talking about?

280
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,520
You’re not into Juhee

281
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,020
At first, I thought that Doyoon is weird

282
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,650
But you were so angry yesterday,

283
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,240
It’s true that I said, right?

284
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,070
What a nonsense

285
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,490
Then what is it?

286
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,740
That’s enough

287
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,500
You’re beyond help

288
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,080
Well, it’s you

289
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,530
What's up?

290
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,530
Juha

291
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,540
Come and sit

292
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,680
You practice hard

293
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,970
Are you coming everyday?

294
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,720
I must practice hard

295
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Is there anything wrong?

296
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,140
Well it’s...

297
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,480
Tell me

298
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,020
I'll listen to you

299
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,020
I have an ensemble performance

300
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,110
I need a team member by this week

301
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,240
But no one accepts me

302
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,570
I feel you

303
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,160
Huh?

304
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,540
It's a project I had to do in sophomore year, too

305
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,160
Oh, I see

306
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,250
What should I do?

307
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,130
I'm a new student, so no one wants to team up with me

308
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,090
Do you need help?

309
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,470
But how?

310
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,470
Why don't I introduce you to the others?

311
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,970
I'm sure they'll listen to me

312
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,600
Really?

313
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,940
Thanks

314
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,070
Then, are you free this weekend?

315
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,150
I'll be fine if it’s for a moment

316
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,570
Okay, hold on a second

317
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,450
Can I have your number?

318
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,370
Sure

319
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,260
And dress up on that day

320
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,720
Sorry?

321
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,840
First impression is important

322
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,800
First impression is important for the other friends

323
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
Sure

324
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,700
Tomorrow 7pm, is it okay to see you at karaoke?

325
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,710
Hey, dad

326
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,170
Yes?

327
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,960
Can I go out for tomorrow evening?

328
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,340
Where to?

329
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,800
Oh... It’s just

330
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,890
To practice the ensemble performance with friends

331
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,340
An emsemble?

332
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,810
Yes, we do the ensemble for the project

333
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,930
With how many people?

334
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,230
Well.. It’s...

335
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,900
A piano quartet

336
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,230
How’s the instrument composition?

337
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,820
Well.. It’s...

338
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,570
Violin, viola...

339
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,700
and cello!

340
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,410
That's the basic composition

341
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,910
and the song is Mozart’s?

342
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,370
Correct, Mozart’s

343
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Have you finished your private practice?

344
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,130
Not yet

345
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,630
I think it will be better

346
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,460
than practicing alone

347
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,670
He could also learn how to harmonize with other instruments

348
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,100
Okay, you’re allowed to go

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,850
Thank you

350
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:28,850
Instead,

351
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,890
I know

352
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,560
I'll make sure to fulfill the practice time

353
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,420
Hey!

354
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,190
I’m excited

355
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,440
Trying the first karaoke in my life...!

356
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,110
Are they going to make me sing too?

357
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm just came now

358
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Oh, room 8?

359
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,750
You can go this way

360
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,670
Okay, I'm coming

361
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,830
Hey, you’re here

362
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,840
Why are you standing?

363
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,340
Take your sit

364
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,730
Say hello

365
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,650
This is Taeyi Han

366
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,860
and my little sister Juhee

367
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,410
A transferred student, right?

368
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,500
The friend that you would introduce for me...

369
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,790
Is it Taeyi?

370
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,620
You’re right

371
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,000
I thought it for a long time, but there was only Taeyi

372
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,760
Taeyi likes jazz, right?

373
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,130
You don’t have to search for friends very far

374
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm sure you'll fit right in,

375
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
you two

376
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,690
You’re thirsty, right?

377
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,190
Drink this

378
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
Thank you

379
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,500
But it's such a shame

380
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,880
If I was a sophomore,

381
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,170
I'd definitely do it with you

382
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,380
with Seheon

383
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,100
What's wrong, he looks uncomfortable

384
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,520
What are you talking about?

385
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
He likes me a lot

386
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,520
Isn't that right?

387
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,110
Am I being uncomfortable?

388
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,360
Not really

389
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,280
By the way, you dressed up so good today

390
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,110
You’re so attractive

391
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,000
Where are you going?

392
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,670
Please get off me and talk!

393
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,800
Why do you act in this way?

394
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,010
Are you dumb?

395
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,930
A dumb?

396
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,010
Yes, are you a dumb?

397
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,720
Why did you come here?

398
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Because Juha invited me

399
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,270
He asked you to come and you just came like this?

400
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,230
What's the big deal?

401
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,860
Why are you stay still like an idiot when he bothers you?

402
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,740
Mind your language

403
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,780
Then how about you?

404
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,700
What?

405
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,990
Why are you here?

406
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,700
Juha does not have any problem

407
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,000
He's much better than you,

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,870
who's always angry and moody!

409
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,170
I’m out of my mind

410
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,800
Then what happened with Juha?

411
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,180
And Juhee besides?

412
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,060
I don't understand your intentions at all

413
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,140
An Intention?

414
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,770
Yes, an intention

415
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,490
It's because of you...

416
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,280
What?

417
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,910
You...

418
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,250
What are you two doing?

419
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,210
Are you guys fighting?

420
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,600
Or, did Taeyi bullies you again?

421
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,430
Well...

422
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,220
You can’t do that to your friend

423
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,140
Do you want me to hit him?

424
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,690
It's nothing

425
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,570
Please go inside

426
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
I told you, Taeyi

427
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,000
I'll make you feel like a trash

428
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,210
no matter what comes next

429
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,750
What have you been doing?

430
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,760
Where are you going?

431
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,970
Juha, you're so annoying

432
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,640
Hey, Juhee!

433
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,230
Let's just have fun together

434
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,270
Are you good at singing?

435
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,190
I'm sorry

436
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,400
I’m leaving too

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,780
Already? We still have a lot of time

438
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,700
My dad will scold me if I'm too late

439
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,540
I'll take you home then

440
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,370
What?

441
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,830
I’m good

442
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,810
Why? Do you know them?

443
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,060
Yes

444
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,480
You go first

445
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,730
Right now?

446
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,060
I will text you

447
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,230
Hey!

448
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,990
Seheon

449
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,700
Yes?

450
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,910
What were you talking about with Taeyi before?

451
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,040
I didn't say anything

452
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,870
Why? Shouldn't I know?

453
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,420
It's not like that...

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,170
What is it? Just tell me

455
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,470
Wait, what are you doing?

456
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,880
What did I do?

457
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,800
Don't...

458
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,560
Why? Do you hate me?

459
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm not comfortable with this...

460
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,600
You're uncomfortable?

461
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,980
What are you going to do if you feel uncomfortable?

462
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,110
You like this kind of thing, don't you?

463
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,730
No, I don’t

464
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,740
Juha

465
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,080
Doyoon?

466
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,660
Stop it

467
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,080
Do you think you deserve to tell me to stop?

468
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,920
Seheon

469
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,420
Yes?

470
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,550
Go home now

471
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,760
Ah, okay

472
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,640
Where are you going?

473
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,230
Are you mad?

474
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,060
Juha,

475
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,190
you're not like this kind of person

476
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,650
I am this kind of person

477
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,690
Don't act like a bad guy

478
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,320
What?

479
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,860
Don't fool me

480
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,780
I can see through you

481
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,870
I gave you some slack these days, then, what, are you blind?

482
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,290
Will you pull yourself together if I beat you up like in the old days?

483
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,590
Please

484
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,090
Please stop

485
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,510
You’re crossing the line
