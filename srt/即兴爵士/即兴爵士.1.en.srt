1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,830
Hey

2
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,330
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,030
You are going to catch a cold

4
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,590
Wait, are you crying?

5
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,270
I have nowhere to go

6
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,160
I’ve knew this would happen

7
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,590
You were out of control from the beginning,

8
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,800
and now it seems like I'm out of control too

9
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,640
It's too late to undo,

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,930
and I don’t want to

11
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,440
Now... I don't even know

12
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,590
My father is a professor in a famous university,

13
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,130
at the same time he is a classical piano virtuoso

14
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,970
And my brother, is a top student under the same university

15
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,010
also a promising pianist

16
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,270
And I'm the mutated genes

17
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,100
in this typically classical music-based household

18
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,570
There is no free time other than sleeping and meal time, and if not,

19
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,360
it is impossible to survive in this house

20
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,730
Seheon Yoon

21
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,400
Yes, sir

22
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,200
You've practiced this song hundreds of times

23
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,070
But why are you still needing the score?

24
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,950
You keep distracted by looking at the score

25
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,040
You still didn’t memorize them yet?

26
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,420
Well.. I tried to cut down my meal, break, and shower time though...

27
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,050
I’m home

28
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,220
You came early, right?

29
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,130
Yes

30
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,890
Did you meet the dean?

31
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,970
Yes, I told him well

32
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,180
Did you practice well, Seheon?

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
It's a mess

34
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,940
Still a long way off

35
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,270
I'll go upstairs first,

36
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,570
I have some things to do

37
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,280
Sure, go ahead

38
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,820
What about your school tomorrow?

39
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,450
It’s not an official day to come to school,

40
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,240
so they told me just to come and take the textbook and the uniform

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,620
Sure

42
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,250
See you later

43
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,390
Watch closely how the other kids play when you go to school

44
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,300
Yes, sir

45
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,640
If you lose the rhythm you're used to practicing,

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,680
you'll fall behind quickly, and you know that right?

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,270
Yes, I know

48
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,860
However,

49
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,370
The reason why I practiced hard even in this tough schedule is...

50
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,170
Is to obtain the driving force

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,590
There is no longer be available only practicing, sleeping, and eating!

52
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,760
Finally...

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,380
I’m free

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,310
Seheon Yoon

55
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,970
Yes?

56
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,810
What are you doing?

57
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,140
I’m... I’m about to sleep

58
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,100
I'm so excited to go to school tomorrow

59
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,270
Ah... Okay

60
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,770
For next, let me introduce you the genius jazz pianist

61
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,150
Seheon Yoon will be performing

62
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,140
Seheon Yoon

63
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,720
Why are you making the silly face?

64
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,640
Huh, yikes

65
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,690
When did you get in here?

66
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,150
It’s been a while

67
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,650
I told you to knock on my door

68
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,690
I did

69
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,030
I didn't hear it

70
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,900
Why?

71
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
It is first day of school tomorrow, isn't it?

72
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,830
So what?

73
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,120
I thought you were unpleasant because dad scolded you,

74
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,900
but you look happy, right?

75
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,500
I always get scolded, so...

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,550
But you took a rest for a year, and now you miss school?

77
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,260
It was not a proper rest, and you saw it

78
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,050
I have been practicing like crazy every day

79
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,890
Well, homeschooling is not easy

80
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,730
Or are you up to something?

81
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,060
No, I’m not

82
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,650
Sure, don’t blame him too much

83
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,980
Oh, and that one

84
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,490
What’s that?

85
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,150
Well, just a random stuff

86
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,620
Scores and composition book that I was using

87
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,370
Why do you give me this early?

88
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm going to study abroad sooner than I thought

89
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,210
That’s a good thing, right?

90
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,960
Good luck

91
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,800
Don't let dad see the jazz stuffs

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,010
When will you leave?

93
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,920
I don't know

94
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,420
I’m sick of this

95
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,600
You know where we're going today, right?

96
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,440
I'll pick you up at school at 1PM

97
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,740
Isn’t this supposed to be here?

98
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,250
It’s weird

99
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,420
It says right over here

100
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,380
Can you go by yourself tomorrow?

101
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,930
Do you think that I’m a child?

102
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,680
Well, you’ve been home for a long time, so...

103
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,350
Do you know how to ride a bus, right?

104
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,310
Of course, I do

105
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,770
I boasted, but...

106
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,400
I don't recognize any of them

107
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,650
What should I do...

108
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,080
Hey,

109
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,330
excuse me

110
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,290
Yes?

111
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,920
Do you know where the Wooyeon Arts High School is?

112
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,420
I don’t know either

113
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,430
Dayeol Lee

114
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
What are you doing?

115
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Taehyun, you are here

116
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,520
Do you know where the Wooyeon Arts High School is?

117
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,890
Wooyeon Arts High School?

118
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,940
It's just around the corner

119
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,730
For real?

120
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,400
He says so

121
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,650
Thank you

122
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,160
Weren’t you get a digits from him?

123
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,410
No way

124
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,830
You’re suspicious

125
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,870
What?

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,460
Let’s go

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,970
Hey,

128
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,880
the weather is crazy today, isn’t it?

129
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,010
It’s hot

130
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,340
That’s what I’m saying

131
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,260
Do we have to come to school in this hot weather?

132
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,390
Oh, it’s your birthday tomorrow, right?

133
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,230
You’ve got anything you want?

134
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,190
Let me buy you something special

135
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,810
I don’t want anything

136
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,280
Do you want to go to a PC room after school?

137
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
I’m going to skip off today

138
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,530
Where are you going?

139
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,370
You don’t have to know

140
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,540
Why are you being so cranky today?

141
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,670
Ouch!

142
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,330
Wait, what happened?

143
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,000
I think my bone is broken

144
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,550
You alright?

145
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,050
Are you mad?

146
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,970
You got fooled with that?

147
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,690
This is a school uniform

148
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,440
And this is a gym uniform

149
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,940
These are the textbooks

150
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,120
Here is your locker key

151
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,910
The sophomore classroom is on the second floor,

152
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,000
and you'll be in the class 1

153
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,710
Any more questions?

154
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,000
No

155
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,000
Professor Yoon asked me to take care of you

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, did my dad say that?

157
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,300
I heard you took a long break from studying to play the piano

158
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,850
If you have any problems or concerns, don't hesitate to tell me

159
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,970
Okay

160
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,520
Welcome to Wooyeon Arts High School

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,900
Thank you

162
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,140
Juha's suspension seems to be over

163
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,780
Wow

164
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,200
It’s so nice to see you again

165
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,410
How have you been, Taeyi?

166
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,830
Are you coming to school again?

167
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,290
Taeyi is the same as the past

168
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,590
Talkative and rude

169
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,300
Does not respect senior

170
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,340
May I leave?

171
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,680
No

172
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,350
Well...

173
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,190
I don't know why Juhee likes you

174
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,570
It's a mystery

175
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,530
But my one and only sister likes you

176
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,990
Be nice

177
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,750
You are free to go

178
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,600
Oops!

179
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,150
Oh my God

180
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,320
I’m sorry

181
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,570
Hey!

182
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,360
It’s a prohibited area to the outsiders here

183
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,030
Sorry?

184
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,530
You should not listen to music that loud, so you got an accident

185
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,950
I said it’s not allowed for outsiders

186
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,080
Oh, I’m not an outsider

187
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,960
To be more specific, it’s starting from tomorrow

188
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
It’s wrinkled

189
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,250
What are you going to do?

190
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,130
I’m sorry

191
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,130
But you ran first, why did you...

192
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,380
Be careful next time,

193
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,800
and take off your headphones

194
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,100
Hey!

195
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,730
Do you know where the piano room is?

196
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,350
Hello?

197
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,280
Is anybody out there?

198
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,640
Listen, here is the interesting part

199
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,610
I know that I’m dreaming

200
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,410
The format of the dream changed a little bit each time, but

201
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,330
How is it?

202
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,210
The ending is always the same

203
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,470
Is this a piano sound?

204
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,100
I think... It’s coming from the piano room

205
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,350
Who is it...?

206
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,560
Is that...

207
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,550
Who are you?

208
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,940
Who the hell are you?

209
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,560
Sorry?

210
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,270
Wait a second

211
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,690
Why are you playing this trash here?

212
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,740
You misunderstand something

213
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,070
I’m not an outsider,

214
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,860
but I’ll...

215
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,990
Shut up

216
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,240
If you play the piano here one more time,

217
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,910
I’m going to kill you

218
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,960
Let go of me

219
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Get out of here

220
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,720
I said get out

221
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,130
Where did he go without saying anything...

222
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,050
Hey, what time is it?

223
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,850
Why are you being so late?

224
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,850
Is something wrong?

225
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,520
No

226
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,900
Oh, well

227
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,400
What are you up to for tomorrow night?

228
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,530
Would you come to the shop?

229
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,320
Why?

230
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,030
Because my dear nephew's birthday is tomorrow,

231
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,780
let's have dinner together

232
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,620
I don’t want to

233
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,120
Happy Birthday to you

234
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,540
Aren't we leaving?

235
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,250
We are

236
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,720
How long will it going to take?

237
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,340
Two and a half hours? Jesus

238
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,390
So I told you to come early

239
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,310
You're the one who arrived late, why do you get angry at me?

240
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,340
We’re here

241
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,180
Are you in peace over there?

242
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,100
I miss you, Taejoon

243
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,690
Say something

244
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,310
Let’s just go

245
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,370
I think Taeyi still needs more time

246
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,040
I'll come back next year, Taejoon

247
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,670
See you

248
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,560
If you play the piano here one more time,

249
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,890
I’m going to kill you

250
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,640
Come on!

251
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,640
Is he mad?

252
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,730
Ouch...

253
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,820
My neck still hurts

254
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,650
Talk after you let go of me

255
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,070
Or at least put up a sign that says “no outsiders”

256
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,110
And I'm not an outsider anymore

257
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm a student at this school

258
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,540
I should have say like this

259
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,870
You idiot!

260
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,100
I want to play it again

261
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,390
Is there any way to play it?

262
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,990
Same song again?

263
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,620
Do you like this song that much?

264
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,040
You only play this song

265
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,170
Yes, I do

266
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,500
I could play this until I die

267
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,020
When I wake up like this,

268
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,690
I can't go back to sleep

269
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,210
Blurry memories becomes clear

270
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,770
I thought I was forgetting about that,

271
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,190
but why did this happen again?

272
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,330
Is it... Because of him?

273
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,580
It’s done

274
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,210
I won’t get a chance to meet him again

275
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,680
You look good in your uniform

276
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,390
I know, right?

277
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,970
Don't be so nervous

278
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,270
Your classmates are nice

279
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,020
Okay

280
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,600
Shall we go in?

281
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,870
Silence, class

282
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,750
We have a new student here today

283
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,540
Would you briefly introduce yourself for us?

284
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,960
Hello

285
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,470
I’m here as a new student from today and my name is

286
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,090
Se-

287
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,760
-Heon...
