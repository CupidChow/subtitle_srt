1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
to love without questioning

2
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,480
Baby, don't mix my tears and be interesting

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,700
Don't forget you are pure and simple

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Stop your wrinkles and become here

5
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,080
Don't fighting, and wave the rose

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,540
Sing it hard

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,840
Over storm

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,360
Listen the voice of love

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
I'm not stupid

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm not stupid

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm not stupid

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm not stupid

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm not stupid

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
I'm not stupid

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm not stupid

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm not stupid

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm not stupid

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm not stupid

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm not stupid

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm not stupid

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm not stupid

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm not stupid

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,360
The Long Ballad

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Episode 16

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm leaving then

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Mr. Sheng

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
What's wrong?

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
When you're free, remember to tell me

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
I'll treat you to dinner

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Go back

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
It's too late, it's cold

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Then

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Good night, Mr. Sheng

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Mr. Sheng

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
This is the monthly bill of Miss Shu

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Miss Shu spent a total of one hundred and twenty-four thousand

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
All in your name

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Signed a bill

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
What is that?

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
This

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
This is the flower bouquet

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
This is the flower bouquet

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
This is the flower bouquet

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
This is what Secretary Hua asked me to give you

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
It's the first time I've seen money returned so miraculously

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Secretary Hua said

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Thank you very much for your help

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
He will pay this money as soon as possible

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Who wants him to pay as soon as possible

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
I don't know how to save money

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I just squeezed it out

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Twenty thousand

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Not enough to buy a five-cent account on the books

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
There is a easier way

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Do you have to work so hard to save money and return it to me?

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,360
What a stupid brain

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Mr. Sheng

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
You say

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
The experimental group has summarized a set

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Related to the latest project to study the progress of the incense

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
A few years ago

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
X-Konggu's laboratory

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Opened their use of the fusion media path

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
To achieve the reduction of protein

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Lightag technology

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
And our research direction is based on this technology

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Try to develop

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Self-test for the rest of the information cell

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Signed non-reducing technology

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Unfortunately, it has never succeeded

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,360
X-Konggu relies on cells to test their own path

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Developed Alltech

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
And studied more advanced

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Attack to reduce technology

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
These two technologies

76
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Are the most critical secret technology

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
In the process of their development of information cell fiber

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
In essence

79
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
X-Konggu is the origin of this technology

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
We want to later

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
In terms of technology and talent

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
There is a big gap

83
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
And H&S has the exclusive technology of X-Konggu

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
The exclusive technology of X-Konggu

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Then they are equivalent to standing on the shoulders of giants

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
See the world

87
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Mr. Sheng

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Should we consider

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Digging from H&S Group

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
There must be a forever under the high star

91
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
This is difficult

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Shen Wen Lang is a rare talent

93
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
H&S Group's stock market system is not worse than Shengfang's

94
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Even if it costs a lot

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
What you dig is just some irrelevant people

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
And also grass-growing

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Mr. Sheng

98
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Should we try to start from Hua Yong?

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I heard that although he has not been in the position for a long time

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
But he is very important to Shen Wen Lang

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Shen Wen Lang even took him to the board meeting

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Important?

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Really important?

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
How can you not even afford your sister's medical expenses?

105
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I am not interested in that

106
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
I am not interested in that

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I am not interested in that

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
How can you not even afford your sister's medical expenses?

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
How can you not even afford your sister's medical expenses?

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Stupid

111
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Business spy and such adventure

112
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Let's forget it

113
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Mr. Sheng

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Did you receive my 20,000 yuan?

115
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,480
Bai Lu

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Mr. Sheng

117
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
What are you doing?

118
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,480
I feel a little bitplace

119
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Meeting with Shen man

120
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,440
Really late

121
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,280
Shen Wen Lang very useful

122
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,280
You are so lucky to be alive.

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Mr. Sheng,

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
did you receive the money I paid you today?

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
What money?

126
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
It's the money I asked Secretary Chen

127
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
to transfer to me.

128
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
That...

129
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Did you receive it?

130
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
No.

131
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Did you pay it?

132
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
How could I not know?

133
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
How could it be?

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Secretary Chen promised to transfer it to me.

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Hua Yong,

136
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
what time do you get off work?

137
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Half an hour left.

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
I can't make it clear on the phone.

139
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
I'll pick you up from work.

140
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
We'll talk about it later.

141
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Okay.

142
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
What are you waiting for?

143
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Come up.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Mr. Sheng,

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
that money...

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
That...

147
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Chen Pingping just sent me a message

148
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
saying he forgot to give it to me this afternoon

149
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
and will transfer it to me tomorrow.

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
That's great.

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
By the way,

152
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
next month,

153
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
I'll pay you the next sum of money

154
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
after I get the money.

155
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
No need.

156
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Just pay me once every six months.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
You can pay me

158
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
as much as you want.

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
That money is nothing to me.

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
But...

161
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
But what?

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Don't you still need

163
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
a follow-up treatment?

164
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
You still have a lot to spend.

165
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Pay me back.

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
What will you give your sister?

167
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Are you going to

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
beg the doctor to give you more time?

169
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

170
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Also,

171
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
are you hot?

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Yes.

173
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Why is your face so red?

174
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm not hot.

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
By the way, Mr. Sheng,

176
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
can I

177
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
add you on WeChat?

178
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Sure.

179
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Let's go.

181
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
I'll take you home.

182
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Mr. Sheng,

183
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
thank you for taking me home.

184
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Be careful on your way home.

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
You're the new tenant of 106?

186
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
You're off work so late?

187
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Yes.

188
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
I'm going to the office.

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I'll be back in a minute.

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll be back in a minute.

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I'll be back in a minute.

192
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I'll be back in a minute.

193
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
I'll be back in a minute.

194
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I'll be back in a minute.

195
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I'll be back in a minute.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Yes.

197
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
The one who sent you home

198
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
is your friend, right?

199
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
He's a nice guy

200
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
who sent you home so late.

201
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Yes.

202
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
He's nice.

203
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I can't tell.

204
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
You have a lot of rich friends.

205
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
The one who moved house for you last time

206
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
looks very rich.

207
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

208
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm Hua Yong.

209
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Mr. Sheng,

210
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
are you home?

211
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Look at the plan here.

212
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
Everyone,

213
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
this is the summary of our meeting today.

214
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
This is the end of our meeting today.

215
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Let's go back and do our own thing.

216
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Okay.

217
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
Let's go.

218
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm at the office.

219
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Good morning, Mr. Sheng.

220
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
I got a small exam this morning.

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I got a small exam this morning.

222
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I asked the sportsman to send it to your front desk.

223
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I don't know what flavor you like.

224
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
So I made the original flavor.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
I hope you don't mind.

226
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I also hope you will like it.

227
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Go to the front desk and help me get it.

228
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
There are cookies for me.

229
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Cookies?

230
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Mr. Sheng, don't you usually

231
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
don't like to eat angel?

232
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
It's good to eat two pieces occasionally.

233
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Okay.

234
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
I'll send it to your office later.

235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
This is the second batch of finished products today.

236
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
During the first batch,

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
I didn't have a good control of the temperature.

238
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
So it's a little burnt.

239
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
But it's not a waste.

240
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
I ate it all.

241
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
It's better not to eat burnt cookies.

242
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
It will be painful.

243
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
No.

244
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I paid attention to spit out all the burnt ones.

245
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,280
Some people say that human feelings are the same as muscles.

246
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
They can all be trained.

247
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
And the way to train

248
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
is to constantly test the other party's bottom line.

249
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
And after he has done the deflection,

250
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
give him a little sweetness.

251
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
If a person who doesn't like to eat sweets

252
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
is willing to endure sweetness for you,

253
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
that must be love.

254
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
That must be love.

255
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
The fight between the two will happen.

256
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Help.

257
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
The alarm set is wrong.

258
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I got up late.

259
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I took the wrong subway.

260
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I ran to the company and happened to be one minute late.

261
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Goodbye.

262
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
My whole family is here.

263
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
I came to see my sister today.

264
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
After the surgery,

265
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
she is much better.

266
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
I hope she will get better soon.

267
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Her mouth is very bad.

268
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
But her heart is softer than the cloud.

269
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Thank you.

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
My Mr. X.

271
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Why do you want to spread everything?

272
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Stupid.

273
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
You are not a primary school student.

274
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Where is the cookie?

275
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
There is no cookie for a week.

276
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I think so.

277
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Is it because Hua Yong's classmates have too many homework in primary school?

278
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
The recent attendance rate of cookies has dropped severely.

279
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Is the flour factory closed?

280
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Mr. Sheng, good morning.

281
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Sorry, I was very tired yesterday.

282
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I fell asleep very early.

283
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I've been busy recently.

284
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I'm busy with overtime and moving.

285
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Where is Mr. Sheng?

286
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Where is Mr. Sheng?

287
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Is he on his way to the company?

288
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Why don't you make cookies recently?

289
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
By the way, Mr. Sheng,

290
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm going to move recently.

291
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I may have to stay at my friend's house temporarily.

292
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
It's not convenient to make cookies in other people's kitchen.

293
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
So I can't send cookies in a short time.

294
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Which friend?

295
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
What's your house?

296
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,280
The area I used to live in is going to be demolished.

297
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
The landlord will move in three days.

298
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
When?

299
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Last week.

300
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Where are you now?

301
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
My friend's house.

302
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
It's too hard to find a house in the city center.

303
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I've checked many houses with the agent.

304
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
There is no suitable one.

305
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
The landlord has already moved in.

306
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm going to move in.

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm going to move in.

308
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm going to move in.

309
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm going to move in.

310
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm going to move in.

311
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm going to move in.

312
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
The landlord has changed the lock.

313
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
He said when I can move in,

314
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
he will open the door.

315
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

316
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Your cookies may only be baked when I move in.

317
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Hua Yong.

318
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Why are you so easy to bully?

319
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
It's not like this to me.

320
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
The landlord refused to open the door,

321
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
so you didn't go in.

322
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Did the whole family's lockers die?

323
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Mr. Sheng.

324
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
The landlord didn't agree.

325
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
How can I just find the lockers?

326
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Mr. Sheng, don't teach children.

327
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
What about your rent?

328
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
The rent has expired.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
The landlord doesn't need to renew the contract with me.

330
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
He didn't continue to collect my money.

331
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
But I still have deposit in his place.

332
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I just didn't move on time.

333
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
I guess I can't get the deposit back.

334
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
It's okay if you can't get it back.

335
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I have a house that is vacant.

336
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
It's near your company.

337
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Do you want to rent it?

338
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Mr. Sheng's house should be very expensive.

339
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
It's not expensive.

340
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Anyway, I usually have a vacant house.

341
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I'll give you 30,000 yuan.

342
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Four rooms,

343
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
two car seats for the house.

344
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Do you want it?

345
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Mr. Sheng, it's too expensive.

346
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
I can't afford it.

347
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
How much do you expect?

348
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
2,000 yuan.

349
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
A week?

350
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
A month.

351
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Okay, 2,000 yuan.

352
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
I'll send you the address and the password later.

353
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
You can move out today.

354
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I'll pick you up.

355
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
How can you do that?

356
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Why not?

357
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
30,000 to 2,000 yuan is too much.

358
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
The house is vacant.

359
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
I have to ask my aunt to clean it every month.

360
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
You can move there and help me clean the house.

361
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Just use it to pay the rent.

362
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
That's not enough.

363
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
There is a base in the company.

364
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
It's very close to there.

365
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I sometimes get off work late and go there to spend the night.

366
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
You can cook a supper for me.

367
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I'll pay the rest of the rent.

368
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
That's not good.

369
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
What?

370
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
It's inconvenient.

371
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Or are you afraid that I won't do anything for you?

372
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
No.

373
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I can trust Mr. Sheng's character.

374
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
But I owe you more.

375
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
It's not good.

376
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
What's wrong with that?

377
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
You can just accept it if you don't have to pay the rent.

378
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Hua Yong, do you want to?

379
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
It's also a debt to owe your friend.

380
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Why don't you owe me?

381
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
It's too troublesome to pay the bill.

382
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
It's too troublesome to pay the bill.

383
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

384
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
You're welcome.

385
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
I'll give you the address and password later.

386
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
I'll pick you up after work and help you pay the rent.

387
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I haven't rented it for a few days.

388
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
I just moved in and moved out.

389
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
You young people are so unreliable.

390
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
I'm the only one who...

391
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
I'm the only one who's bothering you.

392
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
If you're unreasonable, I won't talk to you.

393
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,280
How can you let Mr. Sheng drive around to pick me up?

394
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
I've taken the subway back.

395
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
See you later.

396
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I heard from my neighbor that you always come back at midnight.

397
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,280
And the person who sent you back and picked you up...

398
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,280
are different rich people.

399
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Hua, listen to me.

400
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
You're still young.

401
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Don't be so ungrateful.

402
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
No matter how good-looking you are, you can't always seduce Alpha.

403
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Excuse me, is the subway ready?

404
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
What's with your attitude?

405
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
You're so noisy.

406
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm talking to you.

407
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
You're playing with your phone.

408
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm not.

409
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Write down your number.

410
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Then close your mouth.

411
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
If you still can't talk after receiving the money,

412
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
I'll have to make you disappear forever.

413
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay.

415
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
It's getting late. I'll go.

416
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Mr. Sheng.

417
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Is this place too big?

418
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Everyone thinks it's small.

419
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Why are you still thinking it's big?

420
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm not thinking it's big.

421
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
I'm thinking it's small.

422
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
I'm thinking it's big.

423
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm thinking it's small.

424
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I'm thinking it's big.

425
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I'm thinking it's small.

426
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm thinking it's small.

427
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
I'm thinking it's big.

428
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I think the monthly rent here should be more than 30,000 yuan.

429
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Don't worry about that.

430
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
It's usually empty anyway.

431
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

432
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Okay.

433
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Don't thank me.

434
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
My ears are about to get a cold.

435
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
I'm going to bed.

436
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Go to bed early.

437
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm going to bed.

438
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Good night.

439
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Good night, Mr. Sheng.

440
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
What's wrong?

441
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Why should I go to that kind of party?

442
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,280
What does the new president of Jianghu have to do with me?

443
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Then you ask the organizer to arrange you, me and Sheng Shao You in the same table.

444
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I know.

445
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Sheng Shao You

446
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Mr. Sheng

447
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
President Zhang

448
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Welcome to everyone.

449
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
You are the best person in our Jianghu second-generation circle.

450
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I've been wanting to find a chance to get to know you.

451
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
You're welcome, President Zhang.

452
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
President Zhang is a great figure in the Jianghu business world.

453
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
My father often reminds me

454
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
that I should learn from you.

455
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
You're welcome.

456
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm going to come to your job fair anyway.

457
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Thank you.

458
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Secretary Hua

459
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I didn't expect to see you here.

460
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
What?

461
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
You know each other?

462
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Shao You took Secretary Hua to a gathering of another friend last time.

463
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
So I saw you.

464
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,280
It seems that Secretary Hua has a rich career.

465
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Since you have time to attend the private gathering with our competitive business owner.

466
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
No, Mr. Shen.

467
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,280
I didn't talk to Sheng Xian Sheng about anything about work.

468
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
And last time he helped me.

469
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
No need to explain.

470
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Secretary Hua, blame me for talking too much.

471
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I'll drink a cup of wine.

472
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Don't worry, Mr. Wen Lang.

473
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Secretary Hua and I are in private time to attend the private gathering.

474
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,280
It's not related to your company's business.

475
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,280
But if you're worried about it.

476
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
You can fire Hua Yong.

477
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Great.

478
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Our company's secretary department has been recruiting people all year.

479
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Mr. Sheng.

480
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
You're overpraising me.

481
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
You have a lot of talents.

482
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Not only a capable secretary.

483
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Chen Pingming, Chen's secretary.

484
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
And a beautiful omega partner like this lady.

485
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Where else can I get Secretary Hua?

486
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I think Secretary Hua is still in a relatively developed space in HS.

487
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
So he's Hua Yong.

488
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
He's more beautiful than the picture.

489
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,280
No wonder Shao You came to see his friend group when he was free.

490
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Welcome.

491
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Mr. Shen, thank you very much for coming to give me a grand opening today.

492
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Come on, let's have a drink together.

493
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Sorry, President Zhao.

494
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
I'm a little sick today.

495
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I just took the medicine.

496
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
This is my secretary Hua Yong.

497
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
Today's wine.

498
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Only he can drink for me.

499
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
This.

500
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I'm sorry, President Zhang.

501
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Mr. Shen is indeed not very convenient to drink today.

502
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
All right.

503
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
But you're a junior and a subordinate.

504
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,280
You and I have to count two cups.

505
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Come on.

506
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Thank you, President Zhang.

507
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
First of all, the elements of the alcohol.

508
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Sugar has already been Agency C mów there is not much left already.

509
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
OK

510
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
So let's drink tools

511
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,440
Bai Lu

512
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
facilitating

513
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
torso

514
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I have something to do later.

515
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
You go back first.

516
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Mr. Shen.

517
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
After the meeting,

518
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,840
do you need me to send you home?

519
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,280
No need.

520
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,440
You go back first.

521
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,080
I'll send Mr. Hua home later.

522
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Mr. Hua.

523
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Everyone.

526
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,960
I have something to do later.

527
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
I'll go first.

528
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,680
If you have a chance, go to our hall.

529
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Come.

530
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
President Zhang.

531
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Secretary Chang.

532
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,160
This is

533
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,000
Sheng Shaoyou of Shengfang Biological.

534
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Mr. Sheng.

535
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,840
Mr. Sheng.

536
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,080
This is the famous

537
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
Secretary Chang.

538
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
He is

539
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,560
the rare guest of Jianghu Social Exchange.

540
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Secretary Chang

541
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,120
is the person in charge

542
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,560
of the chairman's office.

543
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,040
He is the top of the list.

544
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,920
He just told me

545
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,320
he wanted to meet you

546
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
and get to know you.

547
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
I brought him here right away.

548
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,480
Because you

549
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,200
are in the same field.

550
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,600
There must be a lot of common topics.

551
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,000
You can talk.

552
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Secretary Chang. Nice to meet you.

553
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,400
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sheng.

554
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I heard that

555
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
there is a young and promising entrepreneur in Jianghu.

556
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,880
I heard a lot about him today.

557
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,400
Thank you.

558
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,320
Hello.

559
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,960
The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

560
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Mr. Sheng is here.

561
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,400
Get text.

562
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,480
Hello. Mr. Sheng.

563
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,200
My phone is muted.

564
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Why don't you talk?

565
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Are you trying to come here and cook with me?

566
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Mr. Sheng?

567
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Open the door.

568
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Mr. Sheng.

569
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
You even let me cook the cookies for you.

570
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
And you let me cook with you.

571
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Is Secretary Hua sincere?

572
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,200
I'm always sincere to Mr. Sheng.

573
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Where's your sincerity?

574
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Show me.

575
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Is it enough?

576
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Mr. Sheng, good morning.

577
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Morning.

578
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Chinese breakfast.

579
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I hate the early morning most.

580
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,200
I eat steamed buns, porridge, and noodles.

581
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Because I don't know what Mr. Sheng likes to eat.

582
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
So I just prepared a little.

583
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Did you sleep well last night?

584
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I prepared the porridge and noodles myself.

585
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
And the steamed buns and side dishes are take-out.

586
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Try it.

587
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Mr. Sheng.

588
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Mr. Sheng.

592
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Did you sleep well last night?

593
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I didn't sleep well.

594
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Why?

595
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
What do you mean?

596
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Because you blocked the wine for Shen Wen Lang.

597
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
So you lost your sleep.

598
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
No.

599
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
It's because my heart beats too fast.

600
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Really?

602
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I've never been so fast in my life.

603
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
You can't sleep like this?

604
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
What will you do in the future?

605
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
In the future?

606
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Yes.

607
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
What will you do in the future?

608
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Mr. Sheng.

609
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
If I fall in love with you in the future,

610
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
will I have a heart disease?

611
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Why in the future?

612
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Hua You.

613
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
What do you think of me now?

614
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Do you like me again?

615
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
It's you now, right?

616
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Yes.

617
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Selena movie.

618
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Love's sexual recordings likeread.

619
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Make it a victim's hate.

620
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Make it the subject's fan.

621
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Come in.

622
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Please have a look.

623
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Last time we attended the technical meeting,

624
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,800
the sales director of Lisei Technology

625
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
sprayed the most delicious perfume.

626
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
So I removed Lisei

627
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
from our supplier list.

628
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
No need.

629
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,880
We have used Lisei Technology's

630
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,600
anti-fiber purification equipment for more than ten years.

631
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
We don't need to change suppliers for a small matter.

632
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Okay, Mr. Shan.

633
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,400
By the way,

634
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,200
the personnel department just mentioned the final inquiry.

635
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,600
The Chen Ke of Group A's lab

636
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
didn't follow the procedure last week

637
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,200
and left the port without permission.

638
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,400
Do you want to do the free processing?

639
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,600
Do you want to do the free processing?

640
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,400
Delete the record of this night

641
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
and leave the port to check.

642
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,400
Okay.

643
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,000
Mr. Sheng seems to be in a good mood recently.

644
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Mr. Sheng,

645
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
you've been busy with work since you entered the house.

646
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
You've been replying to messages

647
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
when you were having dinner.

648
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
You're so kind.

649
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
I'm sorry.

651
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm sorry.

653
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm sorry.

654
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm sorry.

655
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm sorry.

658
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
I'm sorry.

661
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Do you want to eat some fruit now?

663
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Take a break in the middle of the field

664
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
and let your eyes relax.

665
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm sorry.

667
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I'm sorry.

669
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm sorry.

671
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm sorry.

672
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
I'm sorry.

673
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm sorry.

676
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm sorry.

677
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm sorry.

678
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm sorry.

679
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm sorry.

681
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm sorry.

682
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm sorry.

683
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
I'm sorry.

684
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I'm sorry.

685
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm sorry.

686
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm sorry.

687
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm sorry.

688
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm sorry.

689
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm sorry.

690
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
I'm sorry.

691
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm sorry.

693
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm sorry.

694
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I'm sorry.

695
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,420
Shentsong

696
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,460
President Shen

697
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,960
Right now

698
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,920
Yes

699
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,560
Wh largest investment tech company in Asia

700
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,320
was trying to join in China!

701
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,560
Mr. Sheng.

702
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Ms. Shen asked me to go to her office

703
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,640
to deliver the information now.

704
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
I'll be back in a few minutes.

705
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,080
How late is it?

706
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
Make a clean softer start.

707
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I will give you a suggestion.

708
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
After midnight,

709
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
you can't control the other A-Alpha.

710
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
You can only control me.

711
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Every day, when you go home from work,

712
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
you are always wearing the smell of Shen Wen Lang.

713
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Why are you so unobtrusive when it comes to me?

714
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Mr. Sheng,

715
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I am Mr. Shen's secretary.

716
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I am your assistant.

717
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I am your assistant.

718
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
I have been here for a long time.

719
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
It is inevitable that I will get angry.

720
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
If you suggest,

721
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
I will take a bath as soon as I get home.

722
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
But don't say it sounds like me.

723
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
I didn't say that you have anything to do with him.

724
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
But why don't you let me touch you every time?

725
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
I have a rare disorder.

726
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
It is still in the treatment stage.

727
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
The doctor said that it is forbidden to act personally.

728
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Unless...

729
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Unless what?

730
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Nothing.

731
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Hua Yong,

732
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
how can there be nothing?

733
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I want to hear the truth.

734
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Unless...

735
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Unless you are willing to mark me forever,

736
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,280
I can only be with the A-Alpha that is willing to mark me forever.

737
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Mark me forever means to be my only companion.

738
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Of course, I know that this is impossible.

739
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Mr. Sheng,

740
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I am your secretary.

741
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
I am your assistant.

742
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
I am your assistant.

743
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Actually, I am not so greedy.

744
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
It is good now.

745
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Really.

746
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Enough.

747
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I won't do it.

748
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
Don't think too much.

749
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Mr. Sheng,

750
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
tonight the company arranges a dinner for the staff.

751
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
I have to go home late again.

752
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
I am so tired.

753
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
I am so tired.

754
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
I am so tired.

755
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
I am so tired.

756
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
I am so tired.

757
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
I am so tired.

758
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
I am so tired.

759
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,280
I am so tired.

760
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
I am so tired.

761
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
I have been out for a whole week.

762
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
I don't know what I am doing.

763
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
When will you come back?

764
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,280
I will come back tomorrow.

765
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
I will come back tomorrow.

766
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Mr. Shao,

767
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
come to the Tianning Club to drink with us.

768
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
You haven't been out for a month.

769
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
If it goes on like this,

770
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
I will forget what you look like.

771
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,280
I don't have time.

772
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Don't refuse so easily.

773
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
What's wrong with you?

774
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
What is the magic power of that orchid being shaken by Omega?

775
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Let you guard it like a jade.

776
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
Come on.

777
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Don't be careless.

778
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
I am sorry.

779
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
I am sorry.

780
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
I am sorry.

781
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
I am sorry.

782
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
I am sorry.

783
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
Wang Yu.

784
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
I am out.

785
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
So handsome.

786
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
It seems to be S-class.

787
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Be confident.

788
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Get rid of the good image.

789
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
It is S-class Alpha.

790
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Shao Yang.

791
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
It seems that you asked Shao You to leave last time.

792
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
It is the last time.

793
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
It has been a long time.

794
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Why do you look unhappy today?

795
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Why am I unhappy?

796
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Shao Yang.

797
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,280
You are not arguing with that orchid Omega, are you?

798
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Why should I argue with him?

799
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
It's good that you are not unhappy.

800
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
Come on.

801
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

802
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
We are not drunk today.

803
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Drink more.

804
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Come on.

805
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,280
Come on.

806
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
Let's drink.

807
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,280
Come on.

808
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Drink.

809
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,280
Go get a bottle of royal gifts for Mr. Sheng.

810
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,280
And ask some people who can drink Omega to come here to have fun.

811
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Okay, Mr. Zheng.

812
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Come on.

813
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Come on.

814
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Secretary Hua.

815
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Mr. Sheng.

816
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Mr. Sheng will trouble you to take care of him.

817
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
I will leave first.

818
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
I have left.

819
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
Where did you go at night?

820
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,280
What did you do at dinner?

821
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,280
I went to a Korean restaurant.

822
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,280
It's noisy and not fun.

823
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Mr. Sheng.

824
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,120
You're back so late at night.

825
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,400
Where did you go?

826
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,600
Where did I go?

827
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,040
What does it have to do with you?

828
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
Is it related to me?

829
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,440
The strong taste of Omega...

830
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,640
is so strong that I can smell it from every door.

831
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Mr. Sheng.

832
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,360
Did you get marked by Omega?

833
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,480
All right.

834
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,040
I'm afraid I'll only hurt you sincerely

835
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,040
Tears are all over the place

836
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Don't be nervous, we can't be together

837
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,040
How great is the way to use love

838
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,040
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

839
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,040
Repeat stupidity but don't know how to be embarrassed

840
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Love is like a joke

841
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

842
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Who will hug you for him

843
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,040
The news is always better than the romance

844
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,040
Don't say anymore

845
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Don't forget to look back

846
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,040
I only made the thought of persistence

847
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Tears are all over the place

848
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,040
Don't be nervous, we can't be together

849
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,040
How great is the way to use love

850
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,040
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

851
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

852
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Repeat stupidity but don't know how to be embarrassed

853
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,040
Love is like a joke

854
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

855
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Who will hug you for him

856
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,040
The news is always better than the romance

857
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Don't say anymore

858
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,040
Don't forget to look back

859
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,040
I only made the thought of persistence

860
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Tears are all over the place

861
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,040
Who will hug you for him

862
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
The news is always better than the romance

863
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
The one who is not convinced is me

864
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,040
The one who is not convinced is me

865
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,040
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

866
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

867
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Repeat stupidity but don't know how to be embarrassed

868
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Love is like a joke

869
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,040
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

870
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Who will hug you for him

871
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,040
The news is always better than the romance

872
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Don't say anymore

873
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,040
Don't forget to look back

874
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,040
I only made the thought of persistence

875
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Tears are all over the place

876
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,040
Who will hug you for him

877
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
The news is always better than the romance

878
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,040
The one who is not convinced is me

879
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,040
The one who is not convinced is me
