1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
I am foolish and stupid, I don't understand the feeling

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,920
I want to be a joke

3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't want to be arrogant, how absurd and ridiculous

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
A fake hug makes you crazy

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,800
Is kissing better than being angry?

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't say that again

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Did you release the news I asked you to release?

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,640
This mouse followed me all the way

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,480
I think it's been in the hotel for a while

11
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,480
How long can these wounds stay?

12
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,240
You have to be thankful that the

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,920
liver and the tumor have helped you

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,720
consume most of your energy

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Otherwise, with your recovery

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,480
it's a miracle that you can stay until now

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,480
It's too fast, what if Mr. Sheng can't see it?

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
Then let him take you home

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
so that Chang Yu can relax

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
and return to normal

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
After the business is done, I have to go to the hospital

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
to ask for Mr. Sheng's help

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
My secretary Liu Yuan has not woken up yet

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Is it Secretary Gao?

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Nan Hua Wei, it should be here

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Did you find him?

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Not yet

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
By the way, I heard from the medicine development department

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,480
that the target medicine has entered the development stage

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
In general, the development is going well

31
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,480
We have also received the special approval of the clinical experiment

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
and acceleration

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Okay, that's all for today

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm leaving

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Mr. Sheng will definitely come to you in the future

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
I advise you to take a good rest

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
and be more modest

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
You are so patient, right?

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
You are crazy

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
We will see each other soon

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,480
These days are really hard to endure

42
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Who let him stay with Mr. Sheng every day

43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
and leave his girlfriend so easily?

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
It's hard to endure

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
And he has to face these annoying people

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,480
According to his temper, he has to endure to this extent

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Half a life is almost gone

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
You have summarized it very well

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Don't summarize it again next time

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
The boss is in a bad mood, be careful not to be connected

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
I see a target

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
If you can get the death of Chen Wen Lang

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I will give you one more chance

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Mr. Sheng, I am a detective, not a killer

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
No matter what method you use, you must bring him back

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Don't worry

57
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Mr. Sheng asked me to come

58
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Mr. Sheng asked you to take me home

59
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes, this is not a place to talk

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Let's go, let's leave first

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
But how do I know you are not lying to me?

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Mr. Sheng, the rescue target asked me to confirm with you personally

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Are you really the one who took him away?

64
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Let him listen to you

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Ah Yong, it's me, Sheng Shao You

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Mr. Sheng

67
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Where are you?

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
We will be there soon

69
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Ok, I will go downstairs right away

70
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Mr. Sheng, please prepare a long coat

71
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Ok

72
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Hey, can you be a little professional?

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
You can at least take the money from him

74
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Close your eyes

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Don't be afraid, if he dares to peek again

76
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I will dig out his eyes

77
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
As a cannon

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Hua Yong

79
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Go, we are here

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't be afraid

81
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
It's all over

82
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's go home

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Be good

84
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Don't be afraid

85
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Hua Yong

86
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
I am Sheng Shao You

87
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Look at me

88
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Not someone else

89
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't be afraid, it's me

90
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Mr. Sheng

91
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
It's me

92
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Look, it's me

93
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Mr. Sheng

94
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I am here to take you home

95
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Is it really you?

96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I didn't dream

97
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
It's me

98
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
It's really me

99
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
You didn't dream

100
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Hua Yong, I am sorry

101
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I was too slow

102
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I made you wait too long

103
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
I am sorry

104
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I was too slow

105
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Change your clothes

106
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Ok?

107
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I need to take a bath

108
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
You are injured

109
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
You can't stand on water

110
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
You can take a bath after you see the doctor

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Ok?

112
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I don't want to see the doctor

113
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I need to take a bath

114
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Ok

115
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
You take a bath first

116
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I will wait for you outside

117
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Call me if you need me

118
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
I am outside

119
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I am always here

120
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
I am sorry

121
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Hua Yong

122
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I won't do anything

123
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I just want to see you

124
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
You don't want to see the doctor

125
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
You need me to check your wound

126
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
So you can know how is it

127
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I am sorry

128
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
It's ok

129
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
It's ok

130
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
It won't be hurt

131
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
It will be ok

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't be afraid

133
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
I won't be hurt

134
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
I won't be hurt

135
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I won't go to the hospital

136
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I won't go to the hospital

137
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Don't be afraid

138
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
You will be fine

139
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Don't be afraid.

140
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
It's all in the past.

141
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Mr. Xing,

142
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
do you still want to

143
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,440
send the message to the

144
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
department of information and information technology?

145
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
I got

146
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,480
all the list of the core members of the research and development department.

147
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
I'll give it to you.

148
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Okay?

149
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Don't you want it?

150
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't think about it.

151
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
I just want you to get better soon.

152
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
But if you don't want it,

153
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I don't have anything.

154
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I only have this.

155
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Don't talk nonsense.

156
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
You still have me.

157
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Hua Yong,

158
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
you still have me.

159
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm not afraid.

160
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm not afraid.

161
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm not afraid.

162
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm not afraid.

163
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm not afraid.

164
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm not afraid.

165
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm not afraid.

166
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm not afraid.

167
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm not afraid.

168
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm not afraid.

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm not afraid.

170
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm not afraid.

171
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm not afraid.

172
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm not afraid.

173
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
I'm not afraid.

174
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
I'm not afraid.

175
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Morning.

176
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
How can you not sleep longer?

177
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,320
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Didn't you lose your phone?

179
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,360
I bought you a new one.

180
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

181
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
You're welcome.

182
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,200
I've downloaded

183
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,080
all the usual apps for you.

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,600
I've sent you a new phone card.

185
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,640
You can call me anytime.

186
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,960
I'll stay at home with you for the next few days.

187
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
When you feel better,

188
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll be here.

189
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,960
Mr. Sheng, I know

190
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
you must have left a lot of work

191
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,400
to find me.

192
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,280
You must have a lot of work to do now.

193
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,400
You don't have to stay at home with me.

194
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,840
I can do it by myself.

195
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm worried

196
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,360
that you're alone at home.

197
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,680
Why?

198
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,360
Because I like you very much.

199
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

200
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
Did Shen Wen Lang die in the accident?

201
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,960
He just arrived at the basement.

202
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,120
I've been watching him.

203
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,320
Okay.

204
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,480
Block him.

205
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,680
I'll be there soon.

206
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,520
Even if I want to drown in you

207
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
and die,

208
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm very lucky

209
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,480
to have such an advantage.

210
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,800
Thus, I am blessed

211
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,360
and lucky

212
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,200
to have

213
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
as miracle as you.

214
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
But Hua Yong is the only one who can make me interested.

215
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Mr. Sheng.

216
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Your face.

217
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
I accidentally touched it.

218
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Did you eat dinner?

219
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I did.

220
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
What did you eat?

221
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Is the air conditioner too low?

222
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Why are your hands so cold?

223
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Does it still hurt?

224
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
No.

225
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Why are you smiling so much today?

226
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Because Mr. Sheng's look is so cute.

227
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Cute?

228
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Cute?

229
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Cute?

230
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Yes.

231
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Very cute.

232
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Hua Yong.

233
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Although you may not believe it,

234
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
the air conditioner in your bag

235
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
is not the one I gave to Chen Pingping.

236
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Two years ago,

237
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
my father had a heart attack.

238
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I really need the information I want.

239
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
But I won't use you to take risks.

240
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Don't cry.

241
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
It's all my fault.

242
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
But I won't do it again.

243
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I won't let you get hurt again.

244
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Believe me, okay?

245
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Mr. Sheng.

246
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Don't fight with others anymore.

247
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I will worry about you.

248
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Why?

249
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Because I like you very much.

250
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Mr. Sheng.

251
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Can't you find a decent place to live?

252
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Why are you here?

253
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
The staff gave me your address.

254
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
But the road here is too narrow.

255
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
The car stops at the intersection.

256
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I walked in.

257
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
This is not the place you are suitable for.

258
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Little Luo.

259
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Is it suitable for me?

260
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Open the door.

261
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Boss Gao.

262
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Are you going to invite me in?

263
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
It may be inconvenient.

264
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I am not feeling well these days.

265
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
So I didn't clean up.

266
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
The house is messy.

267
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Besides...

268
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
My sister lives here.

269
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
What my sister?

270
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
The one who is always hot.

271
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
No.

272
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Then what's inconvenient?

273
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
You can't stay here.

274
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
You can stay here.

275
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Do I pay you little?

276
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Why do you live in a place

277
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
where even dogs don't live?

278
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
The company pays me a lot.

279
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I have more money to spend.

280
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
You know you have more money to spend.

281
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Don't pay me so much every month.

282
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Didn't I tell you?

283
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
The things I lend you are okay.

284
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
You don't have to pay me back.

285
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
How can I?

286
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
You are willing to pay me back.

287
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I am already grateful.

288
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
How can I not pay you back?

289
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
You don't often have guests at home.

290
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Can you drink water?

291
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Whatever.

292
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Wine.

293
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Why did you suddenly come to my house?

294
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Can you stop being so clingy?

295
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
This is not in the company.

296
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Gao Tuo.

297
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
You are not 30 years old yet.

298
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Don't be so stubborn.

299
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay.

300
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
So you came to my house

301
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
just to make fun of me?

302
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Why do you have more bruises on your face?

303
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Don't mention it.

304
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Shengsao has a blind friend.

305
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
This morning I went to work in the company.

306
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
He sent someone to the basement to poison me.

307
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
We fought again.

308
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
We fought again.

309
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
You are not middle school students.

310
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Don't fight so much.

311
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I didn't want to fight.

312
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
He was the one who caused me trouble.

313
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Why did he cause you trouble?

314
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
He...

315
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Is Secretary Hua feeling better?

316
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Did he go back to work in the company?

317
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Whether or not Hua Yong is good

318
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
has nothing to do with you.

319
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Is it worth your concern for him?

320
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm sorry.

321
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It does have nothing to do with me.

322
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
You are not busy with F-Omega all day long.

323
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
You are busy with other people's business.

324
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Just mind your own business.

325
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Don't make any more mistakes

326
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
that you haven't noticed even if you have a higher score.

327
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You are right.

328
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
I will pay attention to him.

329
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Are you still busy?

330
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
It's late.

331
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
If there is nothing else,

332
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
you can go back first.

333
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
You are pushing me away?

334
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
It's not safe here.

335
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
It's safer for you to go back early.

336
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Do you think I like to stay in this shabby place?

337
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
It's the smell of Omega.

338
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
I don't care who stays here.

339
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
I'm sorry.

340
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
What are you doing?

341
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Why did you break into my house?

342
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Are you crazy?

343
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm sorry.

344
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I didn't mean to hit you.

345
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
The light in the corridor is broken.

346
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
It's been a long time.

347
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
So, it's easy to fall down.

348
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
The man upstairs

349
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
came back from working overtime last month.

350
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
There is no light in the corridor.

351
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
He climbed the stairs, looked at his phone, and sent messages.

352
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
In the end, he almost fell down.

353
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
So, it's dangerous.

354
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
You must be careful, you know?

355
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Okay.

356
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Thank you.

357
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Boss, look.

358
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
I've fixed this hole for you.

359
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Your friends

360
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
won't fall down in the corridor again.

361
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
What a bad place.

362
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Why are the lights on the road so dark?

363
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Is it dangerous to go home at night?

364
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Help me to light up

365
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
all the light bulbs on the road.

366
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
It's the government's business.

367
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
I'll give you three times the price.

368
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Help me to light them up now.

369
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Okay, no problem.

370
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll help you.

371
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Help me to change them all.

372
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Okay, no problem.

373
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Mr. Sheng, don't worry.

374
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
The patient's condition

375
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
is much better than the first time I saw him.

376
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
His recovery speed is far beyond my expectation.

377
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
That's good.

378
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

379
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Dr. Wang,

380
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
thank you for coming.

381
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
You're welcome.

382
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I just got off work and got here.

383
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
It's my honor to help you.

384
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I'll send the doctor.

385
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
By the way, Mr. Sheng,

386
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
you said that

387
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,980
the last time you had a

388
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,800
information-related disorder.

389
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
So you lost an important client.

390
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Is there anything else

391
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
like before?

392
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I haven't been free recently.

393
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
But I don't know why

394
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I always feel tired.

395
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
I have no strength.

396
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Mr. Sheng,

397
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
your first-time patient is coming, right?

398
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Just these days.

399
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
You're a senior alpha.

400
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
In theory,

401
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
this kind of situation is rare.

402
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
If it's omega,

403
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm wondering if alpha

404
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
is using the targeted sedative

405
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
to cause a passive fever.

406
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
But you're a senior alpha.

407
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
You don't meet the criteria.

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
So it's possible that

409
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
the stress of work

410
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
has caused a state of

411
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
information disorder.

412
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Mr. Sheng, you're still young.

413
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
You have a long way to go.

414
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
You should take care of yourself

415
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
while you're working.

416
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

417
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I got it.

418
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
By the way, Mr. Sheng,

419
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I'll say one more thing.

420
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Because you're a senior alpha,

421
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
the patient's body

422
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
is still weak.

423
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
He can't stand the smell of alpha.

424
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
In order to avoid his passive fever

425
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
and second-time injury,

426
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Mr. Sheng, you should keep a distance

427
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
from the patient

428
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
in the first-time period.

429
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
How about this?

430
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I'll give you a few more times

431
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
the omega sedative

432
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I gave you last time.

433
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
So you won't have a hard time

434
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
in the first-time period.

435
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Okay, thank you.

436
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
We dug up a elite team

437
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
from the head agency

438
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
of Wall Street

439
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
to be responsible for

440
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
this time's air plan.

441
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
The stock of H&S Group itself

442
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
is quite concentrated.

443
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
And the amount of the stock is quite large.

444
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
So,

445
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
once the stock value

446
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
of Shen Wen Lang

447
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
is reduced,

448
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
in order to avoid being forced to

449
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
buy the stock,

450
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
he has to draw out

451
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
the cash flow

452
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
to compensate for the drop in market value.

453
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
In this way,

454
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
it's easier for the head agency

455
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
to take their project.

456
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Yes.

457
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
The capital of those projects

458
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
is very large.

459
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
In order to compensate

460
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
for the market value of the air plan,

461
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Shen Wen Lang will be

462
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
in a tight spot.

463
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
In addition,

464
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
our head agency

465
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
and the preliminary communication

466
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
between the design institute

467
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
are completed.

468
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Many standards

469
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
in the paper

470
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
are very helpful to us.

471
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Chen Ping Ming.

472
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Yes.

473
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Within a week,

474
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I want their stock

475
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
to drop below the initial price.

476
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Mr. Sheng,

477
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
you are too conservative.

478
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
According to the plan

479
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
you personally decided,

480
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
Shen Wen Lang will not be forced to buy the stock

481
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
even if he is in a tight spot.

482
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Okay, Mr. Sheng.

483
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
The stock is going up.

484
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
The stock is going up.

485
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
The stock is going up.

486
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
The stock is going up.

487
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
The stock is going up.

488
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
The stock is going up.

489
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
The stock is going up.

490
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
The stock is going up.

491
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
The stock is going up.

492
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
The stock is going up.

493
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
The stock is going up.

494
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
The stock is going up.

495
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
The stock is going up.

496
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
The stock is going up.

497
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
The stock is going up.

498
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
The stock is going up.

499
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
The stock is going up.

500
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
The stock is going up.

501
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
The stock is going up.

502
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
The stock is going up.

503
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
The stock is going up.

504
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
The stock is going up.

505
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
The stock is going up.

506
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
The stock is going up.

507
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
The stock is going up.

508
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
The stock is going up.

509
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
The stock is going up.

510
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
What happened, Mr. Sheng?

511
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Sit.

512
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Mr. Sheng,

513
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
all three projects

514
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
that we've recently participated in

515
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
hasn't got the most votes.

516
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Who got the most votes?

517
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Shengfang Games.

518
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Why?

519
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Shengfang Games

520
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
used a super low price

521
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
to CHQ the Scores.

522
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
They used wrong methods

523
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
to confuse us.

524
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,080
Mr. Shen,

525
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,480
today, Yongguang Department received a lot of urgent reports

526
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,240
that our company is maliciously

527
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,080
making its own shares.

528
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,160
The professional team of the Securities and Exchange Commission

529
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
has begun to investigate it.

530
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
Mr. Shen, the Securities and Exchange Commission

531
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,600
received a question and answer letter from the Jianghu Securities and Exchange Department.

532
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,880
The supervision department asked us

533
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,280
to make a reasonable explanation

534
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,240
of the project

535
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
proposed in the company announcement as soon as possible

536
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
to help investors

537
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,920
to regain confidence with a stable share price.

538
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,840
It's just a few projects' gain.

539
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,960
In the long term,

540
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
the operation of the company

541
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
will not have any impact.

542
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,400
HS cash flow is full.

543
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,040
The debt rate and profit level are quite healthy.

544
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,720
The temporary fluctuations in the stock market

545
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,960
are just related to the short-term competition outside.

546
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,200
Secretary Gao is right.

547
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
In the long term,

548
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,160
our corporate structure

549
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,200
and business are divided.

550
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,640
The profit source is wider than

551
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,440
the same type of enterprise.

552
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,280
The resistance to risk is very strong.

553
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,480
In addition,

554
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
the information-based iron-on-the-spot medicine

555
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,360
developed by AXe and Kongu

556
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
has successfully completed

557
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,560
the development of the drug.

558
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,280
And it has won the special award

559
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,840
for the rapid acceleration experiment of the relevant departments.

560
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
I believe it will be able to be interviewed soon.

561
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes.

562
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
According to the third-party data statistics,

563
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,040
the information-based iron-on-the-spot medicine

564
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,200
has a high rate of 10,000 minutes.

565
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,360
The value of the special effect medicine is considerable.

566
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,880
Once the interview is successful,

567
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,720
it will not only improve the status of HS

568
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,200
in the pharmaceutical industry,

569
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,800
but also can help HS

570
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,560
to develop a huge source of income.

571
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm sorry.

572
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,040
I'm sorry.

573
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't bring Zhang Angzi

574
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,440
to my Meikai Group.

575
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,040
It stinks.

576
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
As you know,

577
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
I hate Meikai Group.

578
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,720
But Hua Yong

579
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,560
is the only one who can make me interested.

580
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,440
His information-based taste

581
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,520
is the same as his own.

582
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,760
Although he is usually light,

583
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
he is very passionate

584
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,520
in special occasions.

585
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,960
Well,

586
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,400
the first night,

587
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,240
he seemed to have a fever.

588
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,520
He was so confused

589
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,920
that he called

590
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,240
other drugs' names in front of me.

591
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,280
Mr. Sheng,

592
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,560
you are so close to him.

593
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
Why don't you guess

594
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,160
that night he was with me

595
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,200
and cried and shouted his name?

596
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,960
Secretary Gao.

597
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,480
Mr. Yi.

598
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,560
Secretary Gao,

599
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,920
your speech

600
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,520
was really brilliant.

601
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,720
Thank you.

602
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,440
Now is a special time.

603
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,440
Luckily, there is a person

604
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,360
who has a tacit understanding with you

605
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,320
and is with you.

606
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,200
Otherwise,

607
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,160
you would be more confused.

608
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,120
Old classmates are different.

609
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,800
As long as you have a look,

610
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,840
Secretary Gao

611
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,440
will know what to say.

612
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,440
No wonder our colleagues

613
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,120
are saying that

614
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,600
as long as you are here,

615
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,320
Mr. Shen

616
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,600
is much more relaxed

617
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,760
in the meeting.

618
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,120
All right.

619
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
You can go back to your work.

620
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll prepare

621
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,600
the next meeting.

622
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Good luck.

623
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,160
Good night.

624
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,120
Come back to work.

625
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,800
Good night.

626
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,120
Go back to the dorm.

627
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,760
Safe.

628
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,240
Did you play that game?

629
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,160
Mr. Sheng.

630
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,640
Hello.

631
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,200
Mr. Hua, it's me.

632
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,520
Secretary Chen.

633
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,840
Yes.

634
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
Sorry to bother you so late.

635
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
I called to tell you

636
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,280
that Mr. Sheng is busy recently.

637
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,920
He won't go back to live with you these days.

638
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,160
He is afraid that you will wait for him.

639
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
So I asked you to tell you.

640
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,880
Okay.

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Okay.

642
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then have a good rest.

643
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Okay.

644
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,360
I can't go home with a cold.

645
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,760
It's a bad habit.

646
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,080
I was tired.

647
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,800
However,

648
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:28,780
thank innovation and the

649
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,420
Absolute Res蛋

650
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Mr. Sheng, you're back.

651
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Do you miss me?

652
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
What's wrong?

653
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,420
You seem a little upset.

654
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,420
No.

655
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm just a little tired lately.

656
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
Is it because you miss me too much

657
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
that you're tired?

658
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
I miss you.

659
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
I miss you too.

660
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Mr. Sheng, are you asleep?

661
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
What's wrong?

662
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
Do you think I'm dirty?

663
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,420
What am I saying?

664
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Then why did you go to another Omega to play the organ?

665
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,420
When did I go to another Omega?

666
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,420
Can't you play the organ?

667
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Do you have to do it until the end?

668
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
Hugging, kissing,

669
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
wearing the bow,

670
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,420
aren't these enough?

671
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,420
Don't think too much.

672
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,420
It's getting late.

673
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
Go to sleep.

674
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Ha-Yong.

676
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
Ha-Yong.

677
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
Ha-Yong.

678
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
Ha-Yong.

679
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,000
Ha-Yong has just turned to Following

680
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Hello.

681
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,920
Ha-Yong suddenly passed out.

682
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,420
News isFFET.

683
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
What should I do?

684
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,420
I found it.

685
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,420
You play the organ for her first.

686
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
She will be much better when you play it.

687
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,820
He'll be much better after the shot.

688
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,100
But he needs to go to the hospital.

689
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,700
I'll be on duty today.

690
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,340
I'll ask him to wait for you at the emergency room.

691
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,180
I'm afraid he has to be hospitalized.

692
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,380
The

693
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,380

The

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,380
The

704
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,380
The

705
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,380
The

706
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,380
The

707
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,380
The

708
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,380
The

709
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
The

710
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,380
The

711
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,380
The

712
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,380
The

713
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
The

714
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
The

715
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,380
The

716
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,380
The

717
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,380
The

718
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
The

719
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,380
The

720
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,380
The

721
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,380
The

722
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,380
The

723
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
The

724
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,380
The

The

730
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,380
I don't want to be selfish

731
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,380
How absurd and foolish

732
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,380
Who will hug you for her

733
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,380
I will make you crazy

734
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Is it better to kiss?

735
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,380
Don't lie

736
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,380
How harsh the words

737
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
are not true in life

738
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,380
The truth is like a whirlwind

739
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
I can't get rid of it

740
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
Who said I can tame her

741
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,380
Who was tamed by whom

742
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,380
The one who was tamed was me

743
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,380
The one who was tamed was me

744
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,380
The one who was tamed was me

745
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,380
How great is the way

746
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,380
to get rid of the dust

747
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,380
Listen carefully, love is like a sand

748
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Listen carefully, love is like a sand

749
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I don't understand

750
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
the meaning of the word

751
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,380
I still want to take a joke

752
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,380
I still want to take a joke

753
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,380
I don't want to be selfish

754
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,380
How absurd and foolish

755
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,380
Who will hug you for her

756
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,380
I will make you crazy

757
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,380
Is it better to kiss?

758
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,380
Don't lie

759
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,380
Don't lie

760
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,380
The End
