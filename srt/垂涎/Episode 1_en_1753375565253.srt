1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
They're here, right?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,320
Yes.

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
I keep many decorative здесь

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
What is this?

5
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,260
Unfair

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,960
Love cry

7
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,200
A lot beautiful

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,840
Top hair

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,240
these together

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,480
You want to meet Mr Sheng's ex

11
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,960
Mr. Sheng has never been in a relationship.

12
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,080
What you see here,

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,320
to be honest,

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,800
are just his bedside tables.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,920
But Mr. Sheng

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,560
is very fond of love,

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
but his aesthetic and taste are very similar.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Some people joke that

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Mr. Sheng

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,160
is just another form of love.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,080
Don't be unhappy.

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,400
In my opinion,

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,640
Mr. Sheng

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
doesn't have any true feelings

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,800
for his ex-girlfriends.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,920
In theory,

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,200
if they didn't have feelings for each other,

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Sheng's first love

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
would still be there.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,800
Really?

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
Of course.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
These Omega Li

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
and Mr. Sheng's long-time lover,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Song Huan Cheng,

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,240
have been together for half a year.

36
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
If Mr. Sheng really likes her,

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,440
how could he be so tired after half a year?

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
The one in the white shirt

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,080
is Song Huan Cheng.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
What are you waiting for?

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,960
Come here.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,800
I broke up with Shao You long ago.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,960
You...

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,040
Such a heavy message.

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Who is this person?

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
When my boss was asking,

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
even the royal family of the Empire

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,480
dared not stand and talk to him.

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
Sorry.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,880
I don't know the rules.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
You're a bold man.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Please let me go.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Why does this person

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
keep posting messages?

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
Can he still release messages?

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,400
I don't know.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm afraid that

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
he might be a little too much.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm afraid that

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
he might still post messages

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,360
and release messages.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,600
Why did he

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
call all the people

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
he had met with Shao You?

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,880
Is he

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,360
going to make a revenge against the royal family?

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
Sir,

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
Shao You and I have been separated for a long time.

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
He might not remember

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
my name.

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
Shao You?

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,040
You're so hot-tempered.

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,440
No.

74
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Mr. Sheng and I

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
haven't contacted for a long time.

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,120
You've been dating Mr. Sheng for half a year.

77
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,080
You're having a heart attack.

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Don't be afraid.

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,840
Tell me.

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,280
What kind of Omega

81
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,080
does Mr. Sheng like?

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,080
One hour and six minutes.

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm really sorry.

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
This is already

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
the most effective

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,720
post-it in the world.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Unfortunately, it's still not enough for you.

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
But I'm sorry.

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,720
But don't worry.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
The lab has already designed a

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,480
post-it that's effective for you.

101
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
You can use it

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
after a safe test.

103
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Give me ten more days.

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,920
I promise...

105
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Three days.

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,520
Chang Yu.

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,640
I want to get the most effective post-it

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,440
in three days.

109
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes.

110
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I understand.

111
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,240
Recently,

112
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
a sudden virus infection

113
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,320
has spread around the world.

114
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,640
This is an unstoppable disaster.

115
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,320
The virus infection

116
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
has caused a huge panic

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
and a shortage of medical resources.

118
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
But the degree is more serious.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
Once infected,

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
it will seriously affect

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
the patient's normal life.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
Experts have found that

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
the virus can be transmitted...

124
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
The symptoms are similar to colds,

125
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,240
but the degree is much more serious.

126
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,920
Once infected,

127
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,320
it will seriously affect the patient's normal life.

128
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,520
Experts have found that

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,920
this virus can be transmitted through

130
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
phlegm, gas, and collagen.

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,840
Everyone is now forced to wear masks,

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and it feels like

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
everyone in the world is getting sick.

134
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,320
When it is treated as a common flu,

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
the death in large areas

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
spreads like a plague.

137
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,520
The most dangerous is CRTV.

138
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640
It's very dangerous.

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
The media questions

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
have been made official.

141
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,440
Currently,

142
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,920
experts have officially

143
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
named this virus

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
that is spreading around the world

145
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
as Y46.

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
And they have conducted a deep investigation

147
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
on the popularity of

148
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,640
the Y46-related virus.

149
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,920
Experts have found that

150
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,640
the death rate of the infected

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
Y46-related virus is very high.

152
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Among the patients with AB blood type

153
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,040
and special blood type,

154
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,160
the death rate is close to 100%.

155
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
The death rate of patients with A and O blood type

156
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,360
is 86.5%.

157
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,240
The death rate of patients with B blood type

158
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,760
is relatively low.

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,160
The death rate is 0.5%.

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Within half a year of the Y46 virus invasion,

161
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,640
AB blood type has recovered.

162
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,560
The people who survived

163
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
are not only the people who have been infected

164
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,840
with the virus,

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,440
but also the people who have been infected with the virus,

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,240
and the three gender structures,

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
Alpha, Beta, and Omega.

168
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,640
The three gender structures

169
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
have been replaced by the previous gender structures.

170
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,840
They are becoming the new

171
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
most popular way of gender discrimination.

172
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
In addition,

173
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Alpha and Omega, who have less than 15% of the total population,

174
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
have grown out of the gender structure.

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,360
The smell of the DNA

176
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,240
and the cycle of the feces

177
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,840
after the division have appeared.

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
Soon after,

179
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,360
in order to successfully mark the match,

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,640
to ensure the unity,

181
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,840
the Alpha also called out

182
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
the blood pressure that will appear when marking.

183
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,640
Virologists from the University of Nottingham Medical School

184
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,840
believe that the Y46 virus

185
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,440
has revolutionized the human reproductive system.

186
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
A few experts even believe

187
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
it is a form of reintroduction.

188
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,240
Very quickly,

189
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
the ABU gender structure

190
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,240
has been named by the sociologists as Omegaverse.

191
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
The three gender structures

192
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
have played different roles in society.

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
Among them,

194
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
Alpha gender,

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
whether it is a male or female gender,

196
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,440
is very likely to make his partner pregnant.

197
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
And Omega gender,

198
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
whether it is a male or female gender,

199
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
is very likely to be pregnant.

200
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,240
On the other hand, in the period of infection,

201
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
the survival rate is the highest, B type blood.

202
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Although the number of people is already up to 86.9%,

203
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
the natural rate of yield is extremely low,

204
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,840
which has reduced by less than 10%.

205
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,240
A large part of people believe

206
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,040
that this ABU social form

207
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
is infinitely close to the wolf group in some aspects.

208
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,520
Alpha

209
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Most people

210
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,440
are also used to S-type alpha

211
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,040
as the highest natural human being,

212
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,840
which is superior to other people on the genetic level.

213
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
But recently,

214
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,040
some scientists found that

215
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,340
in addition to the existing alpha,

216
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,840
beta, and omega,

217
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
there may also be

218
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
a unique minor gender,

219
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
enigma.

220
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Although its probability of spread

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,520
is less than one tenth of the size.

222
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
But it's still shocking

223
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,040
to the entire academic world.

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
How long has it been?

225
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,480
Why haven't those biologists

226
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
figured out

227
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,280
the evolution of A, B, O?

228
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,920
Most of the experts are unreliable.

229
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
It's normal.

230
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,360
That expert also said

231
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,400
that the human evolution

232
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,520
is not S-level Alpha,

233
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,680
but a small, gendered Enigma.

234
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
I heard that this Enigma

235
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,640
can also mark Alpha.

236
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,520
Shao Yong,

237
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,760
you biologists

238
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,280
are the top in the field

239
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
of biopharmaceuticals.

240
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,920
What do you think?

241
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
It's a mess.

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,640
It's a waste of time.

243
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Which gendered

244
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,000
can mark Alpha?

245
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,280
Yushan,

246
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,440
you and Shao Yong

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
won't believe this.

248
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,360
He's S-level Alpha.

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,800
He has the top-notch information.

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
He's a king.

251
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Of course, he won't believe

252
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
the expert's

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,840
one-tenth of the size Enigma.

254
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,760
He can throw away

255
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
S-level Alpha's 800-strand.

256
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,640
Yushan,

257
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,920
you changed perfume?

258
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Yes.

259
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
I bought it from Omega.

260
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
This perfume

261
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,800
seems to be quite popular recently.

262
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Popular?

263
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
Not only popular.

264
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
This new Enigma

265
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
is called Zui Zhi.

266
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,000
It's hard to find in the world.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,920
I heard that

268
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,080
H&S Group, which sells this perfume,

269
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,000
made a lot of money.

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But...

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,800
But what?

272
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
This Zui Zhi

273
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,960
is exactly the same

274
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,400
as the original information on Shao Yong.

275
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,880
Shao Yong always thinks

276
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,840
his own scent

277
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,240
can be bought at a low price.

278
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,640
So he always hates

279
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
H&S's boss, Shen Wen Lang.

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,800
Shao Yong,

281
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,360
really?

282
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't know.

284
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,840
How come?

285
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Don't listen to Li Poqiao.

286
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm not.

287
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,880
Shen Wen Lang asked you to come to the party.

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
You've already found a reason to withdraw.

289
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,680
Why are you suddenly changing your mind?

290
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,440
Don't you hate him anymore?

291
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,320
We're friends in the business world.

292
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,600
How can I hate anyone?

293
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,160
I've always been sorry

294
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
that I didn't meet you at the party.

295
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,120
Besides,

296
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,040
if I really hate Mr. Shen,

297
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,200
why would I ask Yu Shan,

298
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
your middleman,

299
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,040
to help him?

300
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,720
And agree to meet him

301
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
at H&S Group tonight.

302
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,560
No.

303
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Shao Yong,

304
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,160
Shen Wen Lang asked you to meet him now.

305
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,800
It's already late.

306
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
That's too insincere.

307
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
It's the first time we meet.

308
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,720
Wen Lang agreed so late.

309
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,080
It's really inappropriate.

310
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,480
But he seems to be a little busy recently.

311
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,280
He may not be able to get out of bed during the day.

312
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Shao Yong,

313
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,280
don't mind it.

314
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,440
Why?

315
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
H&S Group's development is like a bamboo.

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,680
Not only they are doing well on the Japanese-style track,

317
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,920
the biotech-based board

318
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,240
is also running well.

319
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Shao Yong,

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
you're so official.

321
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm telling the truth.

322
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,760
H&S Group's biotech-based board

323
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
has been approved for the biggest drug company

324
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
and X-Cone Valley has been selected

325
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,400
as the only biotech-based drug

326
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,040
with the same information speed.

327
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,000
As the highest decision-maker of the group,

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
are you sure?

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Yushan,

330
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
thank you

331
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,760
for your consideration.

332
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,040
We're brothers.

333
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,480
You're welcome.

334
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
You two play for a while.

335
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
I have a friend here.

336
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
I'll go out and say hello.

337
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
Okay, you can go first.

338
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,480
Shao Yong,

339
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,520
have you heard from Yushan?

340
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,600
What?

341
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,040
Shen Wen Lang hates Omega the most.

342
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,480
You asked him to work with you.

343
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,680
Don't bring Omega.

344
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
Don't worry.

345
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,080
Your news is so clear.

346
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll only bring you if I have to.

347
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,680
No.

348
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,440
I can't.

349
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
I only drink and play the girl.

350
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,640
When I hear you guys talking about serious things,

351
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,440
I feel sleepy.

352
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
By the way, Shao Yong,

353
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,400
did you ask Shen Wen Lang to meet you

354
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,160
because of your father's illness?

355
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
With the authorization of X-Cone Valley,

356
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,360
HS Group has become the company

357
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
with the most opportunities to study

358
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
information speed and kidney cancer in China.

359
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,080
That's why you're so patient.

360
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,280
Why did you agree to meet Shen Wen Lang at this time?

361
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,680
Mr. Shang,

362
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,400
Director Wang,

363
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,160
how is my father?

364
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,600
He's still in a coma.

365
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
But he's out of danger.

366
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,840
The overall condition is not optimistic.

367
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,920
Although the cancer cells are not spread yet,

368
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
the tumor is located in a special position.

369
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
If the tumor is implanted,

370
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
it will surely damage the body.

371
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,200
For Alpha,

372
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,240
the survival rate of the body is zero.

373
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
So we dare not do the surgery rashly.

374
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,360
In the case of no medicine,

375
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,560
it's the best result

376
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
to maintain the current condition.

377
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,600
Did your father's illness deteriorate?

378
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,940
Although the cancer of the body is a

379
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,200
congenital cancer,

380
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,560
it won't spread easily.

381
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,720
But it's been two or three years

382
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
since my father's illness.

383
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,840
Is it...

384
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't talk nonsense.

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
My father is still the same.

386
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,640
That's good.

387
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
It's almost time.

388
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm leaving now.

389
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
Help me talk about it for Yushan.

390
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
You're leaving so soon?

391
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,120
Yes.

392
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
I heard that Shen's

393
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
family is very small.

394
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
They will be misled if they are late.

395
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
I told you you hate him.

396
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,680
You're a capitalist with a bad mouth.

397
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

398
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm Mr. Shen's secretary, Gao Tu.

399
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Welcome to H&S Group.

400
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,920
Nice to meet you, Secretary Gao.

401
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm Chen Pinming,

402
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,640
Mr. Sheng's secretary.

403
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,560
It's a pity that you have to work overtime

404
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
since you came here so late.

405
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,800
You're welcome.

406
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
Mr. Shen just finished the meeting.

407
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
Please come in.

408
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,320
The light is still on.

409
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,640
Your secretary is indeed well-known.

410
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,240
Mr. Shen has always been a man of his word.

411
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,760
The people below him are not willing to slack off.

412
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Please come in.

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,880
Mr. Sheng is here.

414
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,520
Mr. Sheng,

415
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm here to see you.

416
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm here to see you.

417
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm here to see you.

418
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm here to see you.

419
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm here to see you.

420
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm here to see you.

421
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Please come in.

422
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I have something to tell you.

423
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Why is it you?

424
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm sorry.

425
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,520
This is my office's new secretary assistant, Hua Yong.

426
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
What?

427
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You know him?

428
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes.

429
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
I've always wanted to meet Mr. Wen.

430
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,720
I knew he was Mr. Wen's secretary.

431
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,600
I should have asked Secretary Hua

432
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,920
for his contact information.

433
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
In case he didn't know me.

434
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
I'm sorry.

435
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm sorry.

436
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
I'm sorry.

437
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm sorry.

438
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I'm sorry.

440
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm sorry.

441
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm sorry.

442
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
I'm sorry.

443
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm sorry.

445
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
I'm sorry.

446
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,120
Please don't get in my way.

447
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,280
Hua Yong, you're so capable.

448
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
You've known our famous Mr. Shao You for a long time.

449
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,160
If you had written on the petition

450
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,680
to meet Mr. Shao You,

451
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,120
H&S Group wouldn't have let you

452
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,880
be the secretary assistant.

453
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,560
Mr. Shen.

454
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,520
Sheng Fang Biotech is an understatement

455
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
in our contract.

456
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,040
Before we start,

457
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,840
anyone who knows Sheng Fang Biotech

458
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,080
must report it in advance.

459
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
I really don't know Mr. Sheng.

460
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I didn't mean to hide it.

461
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes.

462
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,640
It's true that you don't know him.

463
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,000
I just met him in He Ci Hospital.

464
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,080
Secretary Hua didn't notice

465
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
that he ran into me in the hall.

466
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
It's you.

467
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,080
I'm sorry.

468
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
I didn't recognize you just now.

469
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm so sorry about that day.

470
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I went to the hospital to see my sister.

471
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,920
I ran into Mr. Sheng in the hospital.

472
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm really sorry.

473
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,440
It's no use saying sorry.

474
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Go.

475
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,600
Apologize to Mr. Shao You.

476
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,080
No need.

477
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
It's not a big deal.

478
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Mr. Sheng.

479
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
My name is Hua Yong.

480
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm really sorry about that day.

481
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,080
No need.

482
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,080
Secretary Hua.

483
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
I'll keep the business card for Mr. Sheng.

484
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Secretary Chen.

485
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Mr. Shen and Mr. Sheng are like old friends.

486
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,480
I believe they have a lot of common topics.

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,600
How about this?

488
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,720
Secretary Hua and I

489
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
will take you to the next room.

490
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
We'll wait for them while drinking tea.

491
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Mr. Shen.

492
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,520
I'll wait for you outside.

493
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,520
Please.

494
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,880
Secretary Hua.

495
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,580
From arbitration to bond Though we meet in 1941

496
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,080
Miao Jian of Ye's Group lives at Shootian Hospital.

497
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,360
In 하나돈�Byung Ho Kim,

498
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
I've decided to borrow San One.

499
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Captain Ye of Laos,

500
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500
he is working on the golden coin contract.

501
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,140
He wants to earn some money on it.

502
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Anyway,

503
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,040
His department is not well off.

504
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,000
Those pretty girls

505
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,640
who don't know my business

506
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,120
never realised my skill.

507
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
I can even prepare

508
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I dare not to be rude.

509
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
The scale is

510
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
the popularity of the outside world.

511
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,160
In my opinion,

512
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,040
your H&S business structure is healthier.

513
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,840
From Japanese products to the development of incense,

514
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,440
your H&S business will be fully developed

515
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
and the business will be successful.

516
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,480
Mr. Shao You is trying to get rid of me.

517
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,520
No.

518
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,560
Compared with other animals,

519
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,200
our H&S's medicinal herbs

520
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,480
may not be as effective as before.

521
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
But as the saying goes,

522
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,520
it's better to rely on big trees to grow grains.

523
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
Unlike Shao You who always rely on hard-working people,

524
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
we are mainly lucky.

525
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,520
From X-Konggu,

526
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
we got the exclusive power to study the results

527
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,440
of information-based county-wide medicine.

528
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,960
Mr. Wen Lang is modest.

529
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,640
He has shown the world

530
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,920
that X-Konggu is also the super giant bar in the business world.

531
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,760
20 years ago,

532
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,000
he monopolized 80% of the main currency of P-Guo.

533
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
After the outbreak of the flu,

534
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,720
he developed the exclusive patent

535
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,000
of information-based county-wide medicine.

536
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,040
Last year,

537
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,720
the annual income of X-Konggu

538
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,480
was 30% of the total GDP of P-Guo.

539
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,520
It's not a big deal to say that he is the emperor

540
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,200
who is the chief of P-Guo

541
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,120
in the business world.

542
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,520
Your H&S group can rely on such a big tree

543
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,080
to prove that Mr. Wen Lang is not a low-class person.

544
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,560
You are overpraising me.

545
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,680
Are you also using our

546
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,480
main-propagated information-based perfume?

547
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,920
Look at my memory.

548
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,360
You are SCA Alpha.

549
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,400
Why would you use our information-based perfume?

550
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
I heard that

551
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,360
the original smell of information-based perfume

552
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,120
is very similar to our perfume.

553
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,160
This shows that H&S and I are fated.

554
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,240
Yes.

555
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,840
Without fate,

556
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
why would we sit on the same table

557
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
and have tea and chat?

558
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,720
Since we are fated,

559
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,160
I will just open the door and see the mountain.

560
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,120
I won't be with Mr. Wen Lang anymore.

561
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,280
Shengfang Biotech

562
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,040
is the first research unit

563
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,520
that produces information-based county-wide medicine.

564
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,320
It's very important to your H&S

565
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,280
research results.

566
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Shengfang is willing to sponsor

567
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
the acquisition of 60% of H&S shares.

568
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,040
The premise is that you have to share

569
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,720
all the results of H&S research.

570
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,760
Mr. Shao.

571
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
Things are very complicated now.

572
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,520
Many people

573
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
may be entrepreneurs,

574
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
but they are like raising pigs.

575
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,280
They will be thin when they grow up.

576
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,960
They just want to be fresh.

577
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
But H&S was founded by me.

578
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,160
I take it as my son.

579
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
I have a deep love for it.

580
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,120
I never thought of

581
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
lending shares or core technology.

582
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,480
300 billion.

583
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,560
Mr. Wen Lang.

584
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,280
I am a straightforward person.

585
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,400
No one will sell their son because of money.

586
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
350 billion.

587
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,960
Many people don't sell their sons

588
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,960
not because they really don't want to sell them,

589
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
but because the buyer is not sincere enough

590
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,760
and the price is not high enough.

591
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,960
Mr. Shao's first price is very sincere.

592
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,720
You can see it.

593
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,240
But I don't lack money.

594
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

595
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,200
I can't even say 350 billion to Mr. Wen Lang.

596
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,160
It seems that the outside world is right.

597
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,840
You are really good at it.

598
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,600
No matter how good I am,

599
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,240
I can't compare to Shengfang Biotech.

600
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
You said 350 billion.

601
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,680
You are really generous.

602
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm generous because H&S is worth it.

603
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,840
To be honest,

604
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm willing to learn

605
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,200
the results of the research on the drug.

606
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,120
A gentleman should be honest.

607
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,280
You don't want to lend the shares,

608
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,880
then please consider to let Ba Xiang Pharmaceuticals do it alone.

609
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
We are willing to continue to invest with the noble party

610
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,120
to accelerate the clinical trial of the promotion of the finished product

611
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,920
so that Ba Xiang Pharmaceuticals can enter the market as soon as possible

612
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
and make more patients.

613
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,680
Mr. Shen,

614
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm willing to teach you this.

615
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,760
It depends on whether you can see our Shengfang Biotech.

616
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,440
Damn it.

617
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,520
It's really hard to get the credit.

618
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,360
When I get the core technology of Ba Xiang Pharmaceuticals,

619
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,920
I won't give him

620
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,240
even 350 yuan.

621
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,680
I and Mr. Shao You

622
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,480
are really close friends.

623
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,640
We can definitely be good friends.

624
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,040
But cooperation?

625
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I think we should just forget it.

626
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,400
What?

627
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,840
You H&S don't like our Shengfang Biotech?

628
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,600
How can it be?

629
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,480
The power of Ba Xiang Pharmaceuticals

630
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,840
is our core asset.

631
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,640
We are brothers.

632
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,880
We know how to settle accounts.

633
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Although I want to be friends with Mr. Shao You,

634
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,240
I can't just

635
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,920
empty our family like this.

636
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,800
I understand what you mean.

637
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,840
It seems that

638
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,800
Shengfang Biotech and H&S are still in a relationship.

639
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,920
We still need to cultivate.

640
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,320
Since that,

641
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
I won't bother you.

642
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,000
Mr. Wen Lang,

643
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,440
we'll talk another day.

644
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,080
I'll figure out the surgery fee.

645
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,480
Okay.

646
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,120
Thank you, Tong Rong.

647
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,160
Mr. Sheng.

648
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
Mr. Sheng.

649
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,920
Mr. Sheng.

650
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,520
Mr. Sheng.

651
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,240
Mr. Sheng.

652
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,840
Mr. Sheng.

653
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,520
Mr. Sheng.

654
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,240
Mr. Sheng.

655
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,000
Mr. Sheng.

656
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Mr. Sheng.

657
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
Mr. Sheng.

658
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
No matter who you choose,

659
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,700
no matter how theoretic your situation is,

660
00:25:47,120 --> 00:26:02,360
I wonder how much

661
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,260
they've lost.

662
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
You are so cute.

663
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Secretary Hua.

664
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
You haven't gone back yet?

665
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
I just took a call.

666
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Did Secretary Gao leave work?

667
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Secretary Hua, where do you live?

668
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Dad, don't think too much.

669
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
You can't go back.

670
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
You may not know yet.

671
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Official employees work overtime at 9 p.m.

672
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
The company will pay for the taxi.

673
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Secretary Hua, you are still in the internship period, right?

674
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
If it goes well,

675
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
I can take a taxi to send you back.

676
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
The new person is like No.12.

677
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Please, Secretary Gao.

678
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Dad.

679
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm sorry.

680
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I heard it in the lobby.

681
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Well,

682
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
does Secretary Hua have a family living in He Ci?

683
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
He Ci is the oldest hospital in the world.

684
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Although the decoration is old,

685
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,560
the medical supplies and equipment are the best in the world.

686
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
It's the medical expenses.

687
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
It's expensive.

688
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
My sister is also in He Ci Hospital.

689
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
It's been many years.

690
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
She is waiting for the surgery to be terminated.

691
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
So, I can understand Secretary Hua's feelings.

692
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Okay, I know.

693
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,560
It's not that you don't like my face.

694
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Secretary Gao,

695
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
you are Beta, right?

696
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I heard from the personnel that

697
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Secretary Gao and Mr. Shen are high school classmates.

698
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
You have worked with Mr. Shen for many years.

699
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,560
It must be hard to work with Mr. Shen.

700
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
No, it's not.

701
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Mr. Shen is actually a good boss.

702
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Although he has high requirements for work,

703
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,560
he never makes any random subordinates.

704
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Since middle school,

705
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Mr. Shen rarely had any contact with other Omega.

706
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Speaking of which,

707
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Secretary Hua is the first Omega who can work with Mr. Shen.

708
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
I heard it on the first day of my work.

709
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Mr. Shen hates Omega.

710
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Did Mr. Shen tell you?

711
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,560
No, it's from Secretary Gao.

712
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Well,

713
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
if Secretary Hua needs my help in the future,

714
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
just tell me.

715
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Thank you.

716
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
You are welcome.

717
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Thank you, Secretary Gao.

718
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
See you tomorrow.

719
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
See you tomorrow.

720
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Mr. Siqi,

721
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
can you help me to go to the convenience store nearby?

722
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
I want to buy something.

723
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Okay.

724
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Welcome to the convenient store.

725
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
H&S is fully updated with all the products.

726
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Please choose whatever you like.

727
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
Okay.

728
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
Sir,

729
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,560
all the Omega can only be used in the hot air.

730
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
It will cause information speed disorder,

731
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,560
headache, severe headache and other side effects.

732
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
If it's serious, it will also cause life-threatening.

733
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
In addition,

734
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Omega can't be used at the same time.

735
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Thank you.

736
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
But I'm a beta.

737
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm the one who can relieve headache with this machine.

738
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I bought this machine for my friend.

739
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Okay.

740
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
In order to control the safety of the medicine,

741
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
please register here.

742
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Thank you.

743
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,560
This is the spray machine you bought.

744
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Spray can effectively release information speed.

745
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,560
But the most used one in the market is actually a machine sticker.

746
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,560
In fact, there is no need to explain these.

747
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
In terms of the use of the machine,

748
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
I'm probably an expert.

749
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I'm sorry.

750
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm sorry.

751
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
I'm sorry.

752
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm sorry.

753
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm sorry.

754
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm sorry.

755
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm sorry.

756
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
I'm sorry.

757
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm sorry.

758
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm sorry.

759
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I'm sorry.

760
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
I'm sorry.

761
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
I'm sorry.

762
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
I'm sorry.

763
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
I'm sorry.

764
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
I'm sorry.

765
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm sorry.

766
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
I'm sorry.

767
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm sorry.

768
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm sorry.

769
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I'm sorry.

770
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm sorry.

771
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm sorry.

772
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm sorry.

773
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
I'm sorry.

774
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I'm sorry.

775
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm sorry.

776
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm sorry.

777
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
I'm sorry.

778
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I'm sorry.

779
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
I'm sorry.

780
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm sorry.

781
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm sorry.

782
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
I'm sorry.

783
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm sorry.

784
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm sorry.

785
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm sorry.

786
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I'm sorry.

787
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
I'm sorry.

788
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
I'm sorry.

789
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm sorry.

790
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm sorry.

791
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
I'm sorry.

792
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I'm sorry.

793
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
I'm sorry.

794
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
I'm sorry.

795
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm sorry.

796
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm sorry.

797
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm sorry.

798
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm sorry.

799
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm sorry.

800
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm sorry.

801
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
I'm sorry.

802
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I'm sorry.

803
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm sorry.

804
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
I'm sorry.

805
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm sorry.

806
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,260
I can prove to you.

807
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
I can show you you tried.

808
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,940
I can prove to you,

809
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,960
she's not music.

810
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,260
She can show all the words,

811
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,880
Stand for the medicine.

812
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,720
In fact,

813
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,800
I'm not your sidekick among you.

814
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,340
I'm,

815
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,820
Miss Chu.

816
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,520
I'm in a good mood.

817
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,100
Haven't drank too much.

818
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Sister,

819
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
What about us?

820
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,340
Lil uranium

821
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,540
Where is Go Pure?

822
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
I did't see her this morning

823
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,400
Secretary Gao has a sudden让iny

824
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,880
and applied for leave

825
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,040
Make a leave?

826
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,080
Yes

827
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,700
I said things related to Go Pure

828
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,080
are you saying them directly to me?

829
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,040
我就抱歉 沈总

830
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,200
you have a meeting in front

831
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,480
I haven't had the time to talk to you

832
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,680
Why did she take a leave?

833
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,240
Taking leave, she asked me to

834
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,800
go back for a% wool

835
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,120
and go through the rejuvenation period

836
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I remember Secretary Gao is not married yet.

837
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
You are right.

838
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,120
But according to the regulations of the Omega Protection Regulation,

839
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
during the Omega heat wave,

840
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,120
the partners who live together for two years will be accompanied.

841
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Oh.

842
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
I understand.

843
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Okay, President Shen. I'll get back to work.

844
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,120
The Omega Heat Wave

845
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Stop!

846
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Where's the money?

847
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Where did you hide the money I gave you?

848
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
There's no money!

849
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
You've lost all your money.

850
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Where's the money?

851
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
How is it possible that there's no money?

852
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Give me the gun!

853
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
No!

854
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
You really don't have money?

855
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
If you don't have money, then sell it to me!

856
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
You are Omega.

857
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
No matter what, you have to make some money.

858
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
You stinky woman!

859
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Having a son is useless to you.

860
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Having a daughter is also a problem.

861
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Wait and see!

862
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Next time I come, if you don't have money, you can try!

863
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Mom, I've already been sealed. I'm not a beta...

864
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Little rabbit, you are a beta.

865
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
You are a beta with a smile.

866
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
You just got your Omega,

867
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
and I'm leaving.

868
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
There are many things that I can't tell you.

869
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,120
But there's one thing you must remember.

870
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,120
You must not let anyone know that you have Omega.

871
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
This is a new technology.

872
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I've already torn off the bad packaging.

873
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
If anyone asks you, tell them that this is a smile.

874
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
You must use it for a long time.

875
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,120
You can't let anyone smell the smell of your oxygen.

876
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Do you understand?

877
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
You must promise me.

878
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Do you understand?

879
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
You said you understood, but you didn't understand!

880
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Mom, I understand.

881
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
I won't reveal the secret.

882
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Mom, don't cry.

883
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Remember that you are a beta.

884
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
You are a beta.

885
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,120
terrifying

886
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
what

887
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
What is thisGM

888
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
relationship

889
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Secretary Gao, you answered the phone at last.

890
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Secretary Boris, you are looking for me?

891
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm sorry, I mysteriously came to disturb you rest.

892
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I found you are resting.

893
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,640
But it's indeed urgent.

894
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,240
Last weekend, I gave you a encrypted hard drive.

895
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Do you still remember?

896
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
It's here.

897
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,880
The information and data report needed for this Monday's meeting

898
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,120
are all in that hard drive.

899
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,920
Now, the meeting on Monday

900
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,240
is managed by Secretary Hua.

901
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,760
Look, should I ask Secretary Hua to go get it

902
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
or should you help him send it?

903
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,520
There's a smell of information everywhere in the house.

904
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,400
It's not suitable for anyone else.

905
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
I'll send it to him.

906
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
Thank you.

907
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,480
It's really urgent.

908
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,840
But,

909
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,880
is it really okay for you to let Omega

910
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,320
spend the heat alone at home?

911
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,800
If it's short,

912
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,480
it should be fine.

913
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Okay, okay, okay.

914
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Thank you, thank you.

915
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,760
It's already low heat.

916
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,960
The heat should have passed.

917
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
It should be fine to send it to him.

918
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,440
It's already low heat.

919
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
The heat should have passed.

920
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
It should be fine to send it to him.

921
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Mr. Gao,

922
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,440
using the information and data report for a long time

923
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,440
has caused a lot of damage to your information and data body.

924
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Based on the current situation,

925
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,840
you can't use the information and data report anymore.

926
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,240
Especially the attention to the information and data report.

927
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,640
Your heat wave is coming soon.

928
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,240
Your body is too damaged.

929
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,240
This is a very important matter.

930
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
If you don't use it,

931
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
you will be in a very bad situation.

932
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
I'm sorry.

933
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm sorry.

934
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm sorry.

935
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm sorry.

936
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,920
Your body is too damaged.

937
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
During this heat wave,

938
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
I suggest you to stay in hospital.

939
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
Doctor,

940
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
I can't stay in hospital.

941
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Then you should at least take a leave

942
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
and have a good rest.

943
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
Doctor,

944
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
if I don't want my information

945
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
to be leaked,

946
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
what should I do?

947
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Other than my sister,

948
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
no one else knows I'm Omega.

949
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I can't use the information and data report.

950
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Mr. Gao,

951
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,920
you've been here for many years.

952
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm sorry.

953
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
You should look at the psychologist.

954
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,920
You don't recognize your identity as Omega.

955
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,920
You're even very inferior.

956
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Is this because of your partner?

957
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Doesn't she like your smell?

958
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
Or...

959
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm sorry.

960
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
This is mainly my speculation.

961
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
After all,

962
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
the amount of you using the inhibitor

963
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
is too high.

964
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,920
You use a lot of inhaler inhibitors every day.

965
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
The inhibitor

966
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,920
is too heavy for you.

967
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
At the same time,

968
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
I want to remind you

969
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
that if my speculation is true,

970
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,920
then your partner will be abused.

971
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
According to the rules of the ABO rights agreement...

972
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
No, it's not like that.

973
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
Doctor,

974
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm single.

975
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
Then it's even worse.

976
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,920
It's very dangerous to use the inhibitor

977
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,920
frequently when you're single.

978
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,920
This will cause information loss.

979
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
What's serious is that it will endanger your life.

980
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Besides,

981
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
it's hard for you to survive

982
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,920
if you use the inhibitor in the hot season.

983
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Don't you feel painful?

984
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
I have painkillers.

985
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Nonsense!

986
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
It's okay if the doctor

987
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
uses the inhibitor without permission.

988
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
You're still in the hot season

989
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,920
and you still use painkillers?

990
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
You...

991
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
You don't want to die?

992
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,920
I just want to give you a piece of information.

993
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I don't want to spend too much time with you.

994
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
But I can't help it

995
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
if I use the inhibitor.

996
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Mr. Gao,

997
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm at No. 12,

998
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
No. 1, unit 106.

999
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Please give me a ride.

1000
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Thank you.

1001
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
It's so cold.

1002
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,920
There should be no smell.

1003
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
If I knew it earlier,

1004
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,920
I would have used the inhibitor.

1005
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Secretary Gao,

1006
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
it's me.

1007
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
Secretary Gao,

1008
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm here.

1009
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I'm here.

1010
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Secretary Gao.

1011
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I'm here.

1012
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,920
I'm here.

1013
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm here.

1014
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
I'm here.

1015
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,920
I'm here.

1016
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,920
I'm here.

1017
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
I'm here.

1018
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,920
I'm here.

1019
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,920
I'm here.

1020
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,920
I'm here.

1021
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
I'm here.

1022
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
I'm here.

1023
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
I'm here.

1024
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm here.

1025
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm here.

1026
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
I'm here.

1027
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,920
I'm here.

1028
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,920
I'm here.

1029
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
I'm here.

1030
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,920
I'm here.

1031
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
I'm here.

1032
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
I'm here.

1033
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I'm here.

1034
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm here.

1035
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I'm here.

1036
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm here.

1037
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
I'm here.

1038
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm here.

1039
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
It's better than a nightmare.

1040
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,920
Don't say it again.

1041
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
You are so gentle.

1042
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,920
Don't forget to look back.

1043
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Only create a simple wound.

1044
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Be a good boy.

1045
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,920
Don't struggle.

1046
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Don't be afraid.

1047
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Be brave.

1048
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
What a great way.

1049
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Listen to the cry of love.

1050
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
Repeat.

1051
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Don't be shy.

1052
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,920
Enjoy a joke.

1053
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
Don't be afraid.

1054
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
How ridiculous.

1055
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Who will hug you for her?

1056
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,920
You are crazy.

1057
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Is it better than a nightmare?

1058
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Don't say it again.

1059
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
The firework is burning.

1060
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
I can't talk in the street.

1061
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I'm thinking about the fairy tale.

1062
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
I can't stop the good luck.

1063
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Who said I could tame her?

1064
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Who was tamed by whom?

1065
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
The one who was tamed was me.

1066
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,920
The one who was tamed was me.

1067
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,920
A fairy tale.

1068
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
What a great way.

1069
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Listen to the cry of love.

1070
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Repeat.

1071
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,920
Don't be shy.

1072
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,920
Enjoy a joke.

1073
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Don't be afraid.

1074
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
How ridiculous.

1075
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,100
속이 가 Amy.

1076
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,820
Are you a little bit more dark?

1077
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,500
Are you there trajectory.

1078
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,180
I'm here for you.
