1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
I am foolish and stupid, I don't understand the feeling

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,920
I want to be a joke

3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't want to be arrogant, how absurd and ridiculous

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
A fake hug makes you crazy

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,800
Is kissing better than being angry?

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't say that again

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Episode 29

8
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,160
Father, father

9
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,440
Because of how ill바

10
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,860
I never knew

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,440
It was a verbs

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
You... You don't want to live anymore?

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,240
Stinky rat.

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,840
Get lost. Go back and wash yourself before you see me.

15
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Mr. Sheng.

16
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Do you miss me?

17
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
What do you think?

18
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Ah.

19
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Have you eaten?

20
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Not yet.

21
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
I flew back as soon as I got off the plane.

22
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
That's good.

23
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm just cooking dinner. Wait for me.

24
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
I'll be there in a minute.

25
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Hello, Bo Qiang.

26
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Shao Yao, you finally answered my call.

27
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Is it hard to sleep after a long night of being alone?

28
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Tell me now.

29
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

30
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm just concerned about how hard it is to live alone.

31
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Or I'll ask Yushan to introduce you a clean and beautiful omega.

32
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
No need.

33
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
I've already returned to Jianghu.

34
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
You're good.

35
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Then Yushan's omega can only be cheap to me.

36
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
There's nothing to do in the future.

37
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Don't make these messy jokes.

38
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
He'll be unhappy to hear you.

39
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Okay.

40
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
It's different to have someone to control.

41
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Okay, okay.

42
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I'm the one who's out of line.

43
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay.

44
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm going to have dinner.

45
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
I have nothing else to do.

46
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I just learned the carp soup.

47
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Try it.

48
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Is it good?

49
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
How is it? Is it good?

50
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
It's good.

51
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
It's delicious.

52
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
That's good.

53
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm worried that my first time making carp soup won't taste good.

54
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Are you busy with work recently?

55
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, a little.

56
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Recently, the company has been particularly strict with its employees.

57
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
It seems to have also established a control group.

58
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Really?

59
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
It seems to be

60
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
the corruption of the anti-corruption research and development department.

61
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
It seems to be

62
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
the corruption of the anti-corruption research and development department.

63
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
The anti-corruption research and development department

64
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
is about to show a very serious corruption.

65
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
It also involves the company's secret outflow.

66
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
In short, it's very complicated.

67
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Then you have to be careful.

68
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Me?

69
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm a secretary,

70
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
not from the technical department.

71
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Besides, I'm very company-specific, okay?

72
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Company-specific?

73
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Company-specific?

74
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Then you're still in love with the boss of the team?

75
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Mr. Sheng has never let me steal the company's confidentiality.

76
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
So don't worry.

77
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
I will be safe.

78
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
The weather is good today.

79
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
The client told me to contact you again.

80
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Good morning, Mr. Sheng.

81
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Good morning, Mr. Sheng.

82
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Good morning, Mr. Sheng.

83
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Did you find that Mr. Sheng is in a good mood recently?

84
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I also found that.

85
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Did something good happen?

86
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't think so.

87
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
I heard that

88
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
X-Control Group's industrial technology exchange meeting this time

89
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
they didn't invite us.

90
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
The information is not in the box.

91
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
There is no progress.

92
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Did our sales department

93
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
accept several overseas orders

94
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
and the stock price has risen?

95
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
So I'm in a good mood.

96
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Is it possible that Mr. Sheng is in love?

97
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
How is that possible?

98
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Who is Mr. Sheng?

99
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Just one love

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
can make him so happy.

101
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
I can't be angry anyway.

102
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Right.

103
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
You are drunk.

104
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
This is...

105
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
The orchid near the heater smells so good.

106
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
What's wrong?

107
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I still feel a little uncomfortable.

108
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
It seems to be a little weak.

109
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm fine.

110
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm fine.

111
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm fine.

112
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm fine.

113
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
It's been three days since the first burn.

114
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm going to see the doctor.

115
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I've seen it.

116
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
What did the doctor say?

117
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
He said it was a heart-speed disorder.

118
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
But don't worry.

119
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm taking medicine.

120
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Hua Yong,

121
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
is it that as long as you are marked forever,

122
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
your heart-speed disorder will be cured?

123
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
It will be cured in three days.

124
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Mr. Sheng,

125
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
it's an important decision to be marked forever.

126
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I don't want to be poor because of you.

127
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm not poor because of you.

128
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I still don't want you to make such an important decision

129
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
so hastily.

130
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
What if you regret it in the future?

131
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
We will be unhappy.

132
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
I don't have a hasty decision.

133
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Okay.

134
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I know.

135
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Thank you, Mr. Sheng.

136
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm going out for work.

137
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm going to be late for work.

138
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Mr. Sheng,

139
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
what do you want to eat tonight?

140
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
You've been sick these two days.

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Don't cook.

142
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I'll ask someone to pack some food

143
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
and bring it back.

144
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Okay?

145
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
I still want to make it myself.

146
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
It's not healthy to pack it.

147
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Then fish soup.

148
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
You made it delicious.

149
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Okay.

150
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm leaving.

151
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Come.

152
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Okay.

153
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
See you tonight.

154
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Bye.

155
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Bye.

156
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,440
The number you have dialed is power off.

157
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,440
The number you have dialed is power off.

158
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
The number you have dialed is power off.

159
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Why hasn't she come back yet?

160
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
The number you have dialed is power off.

161
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Mr. Sheng.

162
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Chen Mingming.

163
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Send someone to check

164
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Hua Yong's whereabouts.

165
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
What happened to Secretary Hua?

166
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
He hasn't replied to my message

167
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

168
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
I called him at 6 o'clock

169
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
and turned off my phone.

170
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
He hasn't come back yet.

171
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I called Mr. Shen Wenlang

172
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
and turned off his phone too.

173
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Chen Mingming,

174
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
you can't go back.

175
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I'm going to the hospital.

176
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll call you later.

177
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Okay.

178
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I'll call you later.

179
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Is there any news about H&S recently?

180
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Did Shen Wenlang do something

181
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
and get caught?

182
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Mr. Shen, don't worry.

183
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll send someone to check it immediately.

184
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
The police have intervened.

185
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
There is no news of Hua Minshu yet.

186
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
The surveillance shows that

187
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Secretary Hua left work at 5.30 a.m. yesterday.

188
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
She got on a car at the gate of the company.

189
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
The car drove to a place without surveillance.

190
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Then she never appeared again.

191
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Have you checked the license plate?

192
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes. It's a dirty car.

193
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
The clue is broken.

194
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

195
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
It's my fault.

196
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
What's your fault?

197
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Mr. Sheng.

198
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Something might have happened to Secretary Hua.

199
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
What could happen to her?

200
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Shen Wenlang of H&S,

201
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Mr. Shen,

202
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
values Secretary Hua very much.

203
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
He takes her to any meeting in the first half of the year.

204
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
In order to get more information

205
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
about the research and development department,

206
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
I put a surveillance camera

207
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
in Secretary Hua's bag.

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
I didn't ask you to do that.

209
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

210
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
H&S's confidential work

211
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
is too late.

212
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
It's too late.

213
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
It's useless to say anything now.

214
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Hello.

215
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Hello.

216
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
You have called.

217
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Chen Mingming.

218
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Do you have a phone call from Secretary Shen Wenlang?

219
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Yes.

220
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Call him.

221
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Okay.

222
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Hello.

223
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
This is the office of the chairman of H&S.

224
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I'm Mr. Shen's secretary, Gao Tu.

225
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Is there anything I can do for you?

226
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Hello, Secretary Gao.

227
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,080
I'm Shen Shaoyou, the

228
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
secretary of H&S.

229
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Where is Mr. Shen?

230
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

231
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Mr. Shen is meeting with guests.

232
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
It's not convenient to answer the phone for the time being.

233
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
If there is anything,

234
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I can help you to tell him.

235
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Go and ask Shen Wenlang

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
when he is free.

237
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Tell me when you are free.

238
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
I'll be back at any time.

239
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Okay.

240
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
After Mr. Shen finishes the meeting,

241
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I'll ask him.

242
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll call you back later.

243
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Come in.

244
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Come in.

245
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
What's up?

246
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Mr. Shen, I...

247
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Don't stand here as a person or a luggage.

248
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I didn't ask you to come to the decoration office.

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Besides,

250
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
you don't look good

251
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
for the decoration.

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Secretary Gao.

253
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
I won't play along with you.

255
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I came to tell you

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
that Mr. Sheng,

257
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
the person who left the body,

258
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
called you.

259
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Why did he call me?

260
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
They said

261
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
that

262
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
when you are free,

263
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
he would call

264
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
me to tell you.

265
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
It's just a few days

266
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
since I couldn't connect with Huayong.

267
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
He is so anxious.

268
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
He is so useless.

269
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
You can't contact Secretary Hua.

270
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,800
Didn't Secretary Hua ask for leave?

271
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,640
You know whether or not

272
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
Hua Yong asked for leave.

273
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,480
You care about him so much.

274
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
Secretary Hua is from our secretary's office.

275
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm sure I know his background.

276
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Besides,

277
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
there are many people

278
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
who miss him

279
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,200
as good as Secretary Hua.

280
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,480
Can you not be

281
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
so obsessed with Omega all day long?

282
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,600
If you're not focused,

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,240
and make the same mistake again,

284
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,880
you'll be in trouble.

285
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
If you don't pack up, you'll go home.

286
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,640
Well...

287
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,040
What about Mr. Sheng?

288
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
Let him wait.

289
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
It's best to rush him.

290
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,720
That bastard is so impatient.

291
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
It's the first time we meet.

292
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,920
The account is 3.5 billion.

293
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,680
It seems that the money in the world

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,040
is his credit card.

295
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,200
Someone should have packed him up.

296
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,040
Don't answer his phone calls in the future.

297
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,040
Gao Tu,

298
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,360
you're my secretary.

299
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Not Mr. Sheng's servant.

300
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Take your place.

301
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
Don't cause me any trouble.

302
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,280
Yes, I see.

303
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,760
Mr. Sheng,

304
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,000
I've contacted the most famous

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
private detective in the world.

306
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,080
Ailun.

307
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,560
I believe that

308
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,800
there will be news about Secretary Hua soon.

309
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,200
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,440
It's all my fault.

311
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,720
I didn't let the monitor go

312
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,840
without your permission.

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,440
Secretary Hua...

314
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,640
It's not your fault.

315
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
I told you the result.

316
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,200
It's my fault to make the mistake.

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,920
Don't say that.

318
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,280
By the way,

319
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,440
Secretary Gao just called me.

320
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,320
He said Mr. Sheng was busy.

321
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
He didn't know when he would be free.

322
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,200
He's obviously hiding from me.

323
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
I'll go to his office tomorrow morning

324
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,280
to find him.

325
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Let's see where he can hide.

326
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,400
It's said

327
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,200
Mr. Sheng's work

328
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
is linked to X-Konggu.

329
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
It's because he has an unrecognizable relationship

330
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,880
with the gang of the P.

331
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
If he's

332
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
trying to hide Secretary Hua

333
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,600
in the background, it shouldn't be difficult.

334
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,640
The world is a world of law.

335
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
If Shen Wen Lang dares to hurt

336
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
a good woman,

337
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,320
I'll kill him.

338
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,160
What about the society of law?

339
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,600
Mr. Sheng,

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
I feel so bad.

341
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,140
Mr. Sheng,

342
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
Mr. Sheng,

343
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,120
what should I do?

344
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,240
Mr. Sheng.

345
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,280
Mr. Sheng,

346
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
Mr. Sheng, I can't let you in.

347
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Mr. Sheng, Mr. Sheng, you can't go any further.

348
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
I really can't let you in.

349
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,560
Mr. Sheng, don't go.

350
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,400
Mr. Sheng, Mr. Sheng, you...

351
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,920
Mr. Sheng, don't go.

352
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,160
Mr. Sheng, don't go.

353
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Mr. Sheng.

354
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,920
Mr. Sheng is busy.

356
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,200
If there's anything,

357
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,680
I can listen to you.

358
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Move aside.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You can't go in.

361
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
Mr. Sheng, you really can't go in.

362
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Let him in.

363
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Mr. Sheng.

364
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,080
You came early in the morning.

365
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,360
What can I do for you?

366
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,720
Shi Wulang, where's Hua Yong?

367
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
You came to find someone.

368
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
But...

369
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,800
You should go to the police.

370
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,080
We're a biotechnology company.

371
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm afraid I can't help you.

372
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,760
I'll ask you again.

373
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Where's Hua Yong?

374
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,320
Secretary Hua asked for leave?

375
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,600
What?

376
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Didn't he tell you?

377
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
I thought people like Hua Yong

378
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,560
would tell Mr. Sheng everything.

379
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,800
After all,

380
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,960
he dared to bring a monitor to work for us.

381
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,440
He betrayed me

382
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
and the company.

383
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
He also wants to help Mr. Sheng

384
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
steal the core confidentiality.

385
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,240
How can he

386
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,800
not tell Mr. Sheng about his whereabouts

387
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
and make Mr. Sheng worry for him?

388
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Steal the core confidentiality?

389
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes.

390
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm shocked, too.

391
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,200
But I can't help but believe

392
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
that he's a bad guy.

393
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
My dog

394
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,280
is eating my food

395
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,920
but he's being mean to others.

396
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,480
He should be punished.

397
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Mr. Sheng,

398
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,720
the world is a society of law.

399
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
The labor relationship is a two-way choice.

400
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,840
Hua Yong works for you,

401
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
but he's not selling you.

402
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Where is he?

403
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,200
I advise you to tell me earlier.

404
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
If you don't,

405
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
what else can I do?

406
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,880
Mr. Sheng is indeed

407
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,120
influential in the world.

408
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,880
But as Mr. Sheng said,

409
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,720
the world is a society of law.

410
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,560
We H.S. are legally operated.

411
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,000
We don't break the law

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
and we don't owe money.

413
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,080
No matter how capable Mr. Sheng is,

414
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
he can't do anything to me.

415
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
To be honest,

416
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm in love with Secretary Hua.

417
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,880
He's willing to follow me.

418
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,840
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
As you know,

420
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,400
I hate Omega.

421
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,640
But Hua Yong is the only one

422
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,880
who can make me interested.

423
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,760
His information is the same as his.

424
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,120
Although he's usually light,

425
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
he's very passionate

426
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,800
in special times.

427
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
How about this?

428
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
The first night,

429
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,720
he seemed to feel a little feverish.

430
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,400
He's also out of control.

431
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
He

432
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,360
yelled at the other members of Rz opponent before me.

433
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,040
Mr. Sheng,

434
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
you're so close to him,

435
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,360
how about you make your guess

436
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,880
when he was with me that night,

437
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
who he gave his last cry to?

438
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,220
When Vice President Zheng

439
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,080
takes a coffeeуг from kanjoh officer Sitaofunko,

440
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,320
is she

441
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You came to my place without permission.

442
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
You even made a new message to suppress me.

443
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
You are too much.

444
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Where is my money?

445
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
Give it back to me.

446
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
Now you know your heart is broken.

447
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
You are a SGL.

448
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
But you let Omega to give you the core essence.

449
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Now you know your heart is broken.

450
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
It's too late.

451
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Mr. Shen.

452
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Mr. Shen.

453
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Calm down.

454
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
You two can talk.

455
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Get out.

456
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Mr. Shen.

457
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Omega is not in the company.

458
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,320
What Mr. Shen said just now is a lie.

459
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
You all put away the core essence.

460
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
We can't solve the problem.

461
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Let's sit down and talk.

462
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
Don't waste your time with the fool.

463
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
You think he is a sensible man.

464
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
He can talk well.

465
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
You are crazy.

466
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Shen Wen Lang.

467
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
You should talk.

468
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Put away the core essence.

469
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Shen Wen Lang.

470
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Let me go.

471
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Gao Tu.

472
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Are you ok?

473
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Throw this dog out.

474
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Shen Wen Lang.

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
It's not over.

476
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Call the driver to prepare the car.

477
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
The medicine.

478
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
My medicine.

479
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
What?

480
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
What did you say?

481
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Give me the medicine.

482
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Medicine?

483
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Your smiley face medicine?

484
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I will find it for you.

485
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Where is the medicine?

486
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
No need.

487
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I will do it myself.

488
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
You should stay away from me.

489
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
You are a beta.

490
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
You are not sensitive to information.

491
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
The smell of the information is all on you.

492
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Damn it.

493
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
The smell of the information can kill you.

494
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
No wonder you are laughing.

495
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
You are getting angry.

496
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Annoying.

497
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Don't move.

498
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Is it this?

499
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Go to He Ci.

500
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Drive faster.

501
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
No.

502
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
I won't go to He Ci.

503
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
He Ci is the best hospital in the city.

504
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
I won't go to He Ci.

505
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Where are you going if you don't go to He Ci?

506
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I will go first.

507
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
I won't go to He Ci.

508
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I am afraid my sister will worry.

509
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Ok.

510
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Then where are you going?

511
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
I will go to He Ci.

512
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I will go to He Ci.

513
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I will go to He Ci.

514
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Then where are you going?

515
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
Actually, I have been there for the seventh hospital.

516
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Gao Tu.

517
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Gao Tu.

518
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Did you see the scene of the fight between Mr. Shen and Mr. Sheng?

519
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
It's so scary.

520
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Secretary Gao pulled the trigger and went to the hospital.

521
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
And,

522
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Fortunately, Secretary Gao is a beta.

523
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
He is not sensitive to information.

524
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
If he were to be changed to DG Alpha or Omega,

525
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Omega would be dead if he were to be changed to S-level.

526
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
That's for sure.

527
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
It's so scary.

528
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,320
But why did Mr. Sheng fight with Mr. Shen?

529
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Why else?

530
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Because of Secretary Hua.

531
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
What does this have to do with Secretary Hua?

532
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Is there any misunderstanding?

533
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
What misunderstanding?

534
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Think about it.

535
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Besides Secretary Hua,

536
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Which Omega does Mr. Shen have contact with?

537
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Usually, Mr. Shen even makes tea for Secretary Gao.

538
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
It seems that when we get close to Omega,

539
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
We will poison him.

540
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
But doesn't Mr. Shen hate Omega?

541
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
I even suspect his surname is Xiang.

542
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
You're saying it and the story is complete.

543
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Think about it.

544
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,320
Mr. Shen of Yen Ou Zheng and Mr. Sheng of S-level.

545
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
They were supposed to be in the same team.

546
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
They may have been dating for a long time.

547
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
But now, they killed Secretary Hua and said they were going to kill him.

548
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
No wonder Mr. Sheng was so angry.

549
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
He killed the group and Mr. Shen.

550
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Two S-level Alpha.

551
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
You're so good at making up things.

552
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Enough.

553
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Don't chat in your work.

554
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
Go back to your position.

555
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Doctor.

556
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
How is he?

557
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
He's much better after he got water.

558
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,320
But his body is too weak.

559
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
It can't be treated in one day.

560
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,320
He needs to be treated well.

561
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
You're staying with him all day.

562
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
But you hate Omega's taste.

563
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Now you know to care about him.

564
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,320
You usually don't want to torture him.

565
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
You're better than anything.

566
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
Why do you hate Omega's taste?

567
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
Omega's taste?

568
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
You're a man.

569
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Can you be gentle?

570
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
You're crazy.

571
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Who told you to keep a secret and do such a good job?

572
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Let the news out.

573
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Let him know where I am.

574
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Go.

575
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Mr. Sheng.

576
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
I'm going to the back of Lex.

577
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
I see someone.

578
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Keep up.

579
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Ailun.

580
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
You have to be careful.

581
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Don't alert the enemy.

582
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Mr. Sheng, don't worry.

583
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I'm the best private detective in the world.

584
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
I have no doubt.

585
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Mr. Sheng, don't hang up.

586
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
We'll keep in touch.

587
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
I'm sorry.

588
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm sorry.

590
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm sorry.

592
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm sorry.

593
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
You're noisy.

595
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
You're so noisy that my ears are cold.

596
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Hello.

597
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
Okay.

598
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Why are you so slow?

599
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm a little delayed.

600
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
What's wrong with your face?

601
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Who hit you?

602
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
Who else can they be?

603
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Sheng Shao You?

604
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
You're crazy.

605
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
My secretary is in the hospital.

606
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
What a bad luck.

607
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Let me tell you.

608
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,320
The boss's mood has just stabilized.

609
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:43,840
He has a sense of

610
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
He had a few days ago.

611
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
He got himself a whole body injury.

612
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
He just recovered a little yesterday.

613
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
He started to deal with the case of the P group.

614
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,840
The few who just woke up are considered criminals.

615
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Six main criminals came yesterday.

616
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Both are lying in the hospital.

617
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,840
What are the four?

618
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Four light injuries and two serious injuries.

619
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,840
He's really crazy.

620
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
He hit you so hard.

621
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
It's not your fault.

622
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Someone took advantage of the new route

623
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
while you were not in the headquarters.

624
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
He's quite a man.

625
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
But his means are not very smart.

626
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,840
The first batch of goods were intercepted before they were released.

627
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
If it were before,

628
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,840
the boss would never let them leave alive.

629
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,840
When did he become so kind?

630
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Is it because of the good weather?

631
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,840
The little crazy man suddenly has a good heart.

632
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Who knows?

633
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I heard that he was trying to give the new people a good chance.

634
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Crazy.

635
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
We're here.

636
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
I'll open the door.

637
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
You go in and say a few words.

638
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Okay.

639
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Have you seen the Omega from 9901?

640
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
The Omega with the orchid scent.

641
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
It's quite elegant.

642
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,840
It looks like a good kid.

643
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
What a pity.

644
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
What's a pity?

645
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
What a pity.

646
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I was almost fooled by those rough Alphas.

647
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Really?

648
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,840
I saw it from afar when it first entered the headquarters.

649
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I didn't see it clearly.

650
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,840
But it's not bad to be able to catch a group of Alphas.

651
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
It's not bad.

652
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
That Omega is from the wrong generation.

653
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
But it has a cold and delicate face.

654
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
If I were an Alpha,

655
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,840
I would give it to it as long as it cries.

656
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
But I heard from the night shift's little Zhang that

657
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
his suite is very big.

658
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,840
He's full of blood.

659
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
He was exposed by the senior management.

660
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I don't care if he did it or not.

661
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
It's really a sin to think about it.

662
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Why are you so drunk?

663
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
You care about him?

664
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Maybe he's willing to.

665
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
You saw it just now.

666
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Just now from his room,

667
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,840
a group of Alphas came out.

668
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
A group of Alphas.

669
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
You just broke into the scene.

670
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
You can't say that.

671
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Maybe you just saw it wrong.

672
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Don't be so selfish.

673
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
How can you see it wrong?

674
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
99th floor.

675
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
X-Control.

676
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,840
It's used for receiving VIPs.

677
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Those rich and powerful people.

678
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
They haven't played anything.

679
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Since they came here,

680
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
they have to play something more fresh.

681
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Besides,

682
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
9901.

683
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
The room is full of businessmen.

684
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,840
There must be a lot of guests.

685
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
If they play one by one,

686
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
how can they play until the end of the year?

687
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
So,

688
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
for efficiency,

689
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,840
the right overlap is a good thing.

690
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Many of the guests there are familiar.

691
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Familiar people group together to exercise.

692
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
That's a common thing.

693
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
In the end,

694
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,840
sharing an Omega is also a kind of cooperation.

695
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
So,

696
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,840
it can be written as close.

697
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
So, you mean,

698
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
he is covered in blood

699
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
because he was

700
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
carried by four

701
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Omega.

702
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
How many Alphas do you want to serve?

703
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Play with them.

704
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Ailun.

705
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Bring Ailun back.

706
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
What?

707
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Ailun.

708
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Bring her back.

709
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Ailun.

710
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Ailun.

711
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I want you to bring her back.

712
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Mr. Sheng,

713
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
my hearing is normal.

714
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
You talk too loudly.

715
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I'm going deaf.

716
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
As long as you bring her back,

717
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
you can pay the price.

718
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,840
I owe you a favor forever.

719
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Okay, don't worry.

720
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Do you want to go to the X Hotel?

721
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't know.

722
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I think you're wrong.

723
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Don't talk nonsense.

724
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Answer me.

725
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
I've been there before,

726
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
but I'm not good at it.

727
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
It's a place for people to be cheated.

728
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
It's different from our route.

729
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
It's too wild.

730
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm afraid I'll be disappointed.

731
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
But I heard that

732
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
the new owner of X控股

733
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
is a little behind.

734
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
So I'm going to find him.

735
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I'll wait for you.

736
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Okay.

737
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
You can go.

738
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Okay.

739
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Go.

740
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Go.

741
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Go.

742
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
The new owner has a sense of identity after being hurt.

743
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
But I don't know the details.

744
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Shen Wen Lang.

745
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Shen Wen Lang.

746
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Shen Wen Lang.

747
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
How dare you?

748
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
How dare you?

749
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I don't like you.

750
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
I don't know the man down there.

751
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,840
I'm still in the mood to sleep here.

752
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,520
Get up.

753
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,120
Wen Lang.

754
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,280
Get up.

755
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,760
So noisy.

756
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,840
Sheng Wen Lang.

757
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,880
Did the sky collapse?

758
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,760
It didn't collapse.

759
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,480
It's just that Wen Lang

760
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,960
got Sheng Shao You beaten.

761
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,800
I've reminded you long ago.

762
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,480
He's fierce.

763
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,200
You have to be careful.

764
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
You've returned the sword.

765
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,080
What else?

766
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,080
I deserve to stand there and let him beat me.

767
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,920
You touched him.

768
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm protecting him.

769
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,640
Don't you understand?

770
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,400
No.

771
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,480
Where did you touch him?

772
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,880
He was about to choke me to death.

773
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,360
I kicked him.

774
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
Only one foot.

775
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,240
You're sick.

776
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,840
This is not my fault.

777
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Forget it this time.

778
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
You don't have experience.

779
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,640
Next time, don't be rude to Mr. Sheng.

780
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,920
There's no next time, Huayou.

781
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,000
Do you think I'm willing to?

782
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
If I hadn't owed you a favor

783
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,240
when we started the business,

784
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,640
I wouldn't have been able to do this.

785
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
I'm not.

786
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
I'm not.

787
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm not.

788
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
I'm not.

789
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I'm not.

790
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm not.

791
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
You're not.

792
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,840
You're my partner in HS.

793
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,240
Do you think I'm willing to take this?

794
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,880
Mr. Sheng is a fool.

795
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
He's trying to get you.

796
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm not.

797
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,320
If it weren't for your bad plot,

798
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,600
I would have done the same.

799
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Wen Lang.

800
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,880
It's a good quality to repay a favor.

801
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
I helped you, so you helped me.

802
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,800
If you need my help in the future,

803
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,920
you can come and go.

804
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
It's a good quality.

805
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,760
Good quality?

806
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,160
I can ask you to help me.

807
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,800
Next time, when you teach your subordinates,

808
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,040
be gentle.

809
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Can you leave me and Chang Yu

810
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,280
some people who don't want to stay in the hospital?

811
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
If they leave your room,

812
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,880
none of them can start work normally.

813
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,680
The ones from yesterday

814
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,600
are still lying in the hospital.

815
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
No.

816
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Wen Lang.

817
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
If you don't have the waste of money

818
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,440
to touch the drugs,

819
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,920
the earth won't stop, right?

820
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,240
You know it.

821
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,640
I spent so much time

822
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,440
to bring this broken ship to work.

823
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Whoever wants to mess with my family,

824
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,040
I'll kill them.

825
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Is it reasonable?

826
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
It's...

827
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
It's...

828
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
It's...

829
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,640
In the future,

830
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
whoever dares to touch this kind of things,

831
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
I don't need you to show up.

832
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
I'll be the first to kill them.

833
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
That's right.

834
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
I know

835
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,640
it's not easy for you and Chang Yu to work with others.

836
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
But Wen Lang,

837
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
I'm soft-hearted enough.

838
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
But I just pulled a few strings

839
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
and let them go without thinking.

840
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Why are you still unsatisfied?

841
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
You're pulling strings.

842
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
If you do it again,

843
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
you'll lose your life.

844
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I didn't spend much effort.

845
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
If I can die with this,

846
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I can only blame myself for being too weak.

847
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
Alright, Wen Lang.

848
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
The boss has left them a way to change their lives.

849
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
This is their blessing.

850
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
It's my bottom line not to touch the drugs.

851
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
Take good care of your people.

852
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Don't let me down again.

853
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Yes.

854
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Did you release the news

855
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I asked you to release?

856
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Use love as a tool

857
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
What a great way

858
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

859
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Repeat stupidity but don't understand the embarrassment

860
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Still want to be a joke

861
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Don't be arrogant

862
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
How absurd

863
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Who used you to make you crazy

864
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Is it better than being a coward?

865
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Don't say more lies

866
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
You are so gentle

867
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Don't forget to look back

868
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Only create an unfulfilled wound

869
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,440
If you want to be obedient in every way

870
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Don't struggle

871
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Don't let the smoke go out

872
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Use love as a tool

873
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
What a great way

874
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

875
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Repeat stupidity but don't understand the embarrassment

876
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,440
Still want to be a joke

877
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Don't be arrogant

878
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
How absurd

879
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Who used you to make you crazy

880
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,440
Is it better than being a coward?

881
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Don't say more lies

882
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
How absurd

883
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Don't talk in the street

884
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
True heart is like a whirlpool

885
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,440
Can't stop the flow of the spring

886
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
Who said I can tame her

887
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Who is tamed by whom

888
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
The one who is tamed is me

889
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,440
The one who is tamed is me

890
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Don't be arrogant

891
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Don't let the smoke go out

892
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,440
Use love as a tool

893
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
What a great way

894
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Listen carefully to the bitter words of love

895
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Repeat stupidity but don't understand the embarrassment

896
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Still want to be a joke

897
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Don't be arrogant

898
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
How absurd

899
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,440
The false hug makes you crazy

900
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,440
The false hug makes you crazy

901
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Is it better than being a coward?

902
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Don't say more lies
