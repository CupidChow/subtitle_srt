1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
I am foolish and stupid, I don't understand the feeling

2
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,920
I want to be a joke

3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't want to be arrogant, how absurd and ridiculous

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
A fake hug makes you crazy

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,800
Is kissing better than being angry?

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't say that again

7
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Episode 19

8
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,380
Such thick hair

9
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,020
I can smell Omega's scent

10
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,100
from the door.

11
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,980
Mr. Sheng,

12
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,820
did you get marked by Omega?

13
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,620
It's your turn

14
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,620
to interfere with my business.

15
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,020
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,460
Mr. Sheng is right.

17
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,380
I'll go back to my room.

18
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,940
Good night.

19
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,860
Why are your hands so cold?

20
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,020
Besides,

21
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,900
you've been waiting for me for a long time,

22
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,020
haven't you?

23
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,020
I'm sorry.

24
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,180
At nine o'clock in the morning,

25
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,700
I bought coffee for Mr. Sheng.

26
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,500
At eleven o'clock,

27
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,980
I reminded him to have lunch.

28
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,460
At one o'clock,

29
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,660
I reminded him to have lunch.

30
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,220
At three o'clock,

31
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,900
I reminded him to attend a meeting.

32
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,300
Shen Wen Lang is not a genius.

33
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,060
Why does he even need to be reminded to eat?

34
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,300
He's so rich.

35
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,580
This bastard

36
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,860
is even concerned about Shen Wen Lang's

37
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,660
lunch and dinner in the company.

38
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,900
He went home to fight with me.

39
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,140
He didn't dare to talk to me.

40
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,740
Since he ignored me,

41
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,500
why should I go back here?

42
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,220
Mr. Sheng,

43
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,260
thank you for taking care of me these days.

44
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,260
I've been thinking about it.

45
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,260
It's really inappropriate to keep bothering you.

46
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,940
These days,

47
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,060
I've found another place

48
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,100
where other people live.

49
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,940
I'll leave tonight.

50
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,460
Dinner is in the fridge.

51
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,740
Remember to eat it.

52
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,620
Besides,

53
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,140
I'll pay back the money you lent me on time.

54
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,180
But if there's nothing else,

55
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,340
let's not meet in the future.

56
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,860
What do you mean we won't meet in the future?

57
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,780
Where are you going?

58
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,180
Mr. Sheng,

59
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,140
you're back just in time.

60
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,740
I just want to thank you in person.

61
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,700
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

62
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,580
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,540
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,420
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,300
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Goodbye.

76
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,780
You can come and go as you want.

77
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,220
What do you think I am?

78
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Is this a shelter?

79
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
What do you want?

81
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,340
What do I want?

82
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,340
Can I do whatever I want?

83
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
No.

84
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,420
If you still want to see me,

85
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
then forget it.

86
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Forget it.

87
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Why?

88
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,060
You don't want to play

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,980
the love game

90
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,300
that can't be kissed directly?

91
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Or

92
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
you want to forever

93
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,620
mark your alpha?

94
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,100
No.

95
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,020
I don't want to continue like this anymore.

96
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Why?

97
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,980
Because I like you very much.

98
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
Every time I think of you

99
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,420
being with other Omega,

100
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,020
jealousy will make me look ugly.

101
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I don't want to be with you anymore.

102
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,020
I don't want to be with you anymore.

103
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
I don't want to be with you anymore.

104
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I don't want to be with you anymore.

105
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Jealousy will make me look ugly.

106
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
It makes me look like I'm not myself.

107
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
I'm really too bad.

108
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,820
So let's just forget it.

109
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,820
Don't see each other again.

110
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Mr. Sheng.

111
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm really happy.

112
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
We just talked about it.

113
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
Where are you going?

114
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
I've said everything I wanted to say.

115
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
But I didn't agree.

116
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Hua Yang.

117
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,020
Don't go.

118
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Let's sit down and talk slowly.

119
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
Okay?

120
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,020
Let's talk here.

121
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,020
I hope you don't mind.

122
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I can't make it clear.

123
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
Don't be a fool.

124
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Put your luggage in your room.

125
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Be good.

126
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,020
Thank you.

127
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Thank you.

128
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
A Yong.

129
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
Let's drink.

130
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Stop messing around.

131
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Okay?

132
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
Okay.

133
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Let's stop fighting in the future.

134
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Okay?

135
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,020
Okay.

136
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Mr. Sheng.

137
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
You have a business dinner tonight.

138
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,020
You have an appointment with Mr. Chu of Yunnan Group tomorrow.

139
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
There is no arrangement for the day after tomorrow.

140
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,020
I will send you the details of the meeting on Monday.

141
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
Where is Gao Tu?

142
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,020
Secretary Gao asked for a ten-day leave.

143
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,020
But don't worry.

144
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
He handed over the work in advance.

145
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
I will take care of your personal affairs.

146
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Ask for leave again?

147
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Why?

148
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
It seems to be because of something at home.

149
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
What can he do?

150
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
He probably went to accompany that

151
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
hot omega for three days.

152
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,020
It doesn't matter.

153
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Since you like to be a model couple at home,

154
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,020
then don't come back.

155
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
He is in charge of work.

156
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
You can find someone to hand over the work.

157
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Yes.

158
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I will go to the office.

159
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,020
I will go to the office.

160
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
I will go to the office.

161
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
I will go to the office.

162
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
I will go to the office.

163
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
I will go to the office.

164
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
I will go to the office.

165
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
I will go to the office.

166
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
I will go to the office.

167
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
I will go to the office.

168
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
I will go to the office.

169
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
I will go to the office.

170
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
I will go to the office.

171
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I will go to the office.

172
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
I will go to the office.

173
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
I will go to the office.

174
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
I will go to the office.

175
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
I will go to the office.

176
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
I will go to the office.

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
I will go to the office.

178
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
I will go to the office.

179
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I will go to the office.

180
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
I will go to the office.

181
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
I will go to the office.

182
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
What are you doing?

183
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Cut the plane for me.

184
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

185
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
May I ask if I can

186
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
give you one minute?

187
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,020
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
May I give you one minute?

200
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Gao Tuo.

201
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Please excuse me.

203
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Mr. Shen.

204
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
I only need one minute.

205
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
I don't have to

206
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
demand a result.

207
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
I just hope

208
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
to break through myself.

209
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
May I?

210
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Mr. Shen.

212
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
You'd better break through others.

213
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
Mr. Shen is very busy.

214
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
So annoying.

215
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Even if you refuse,

216
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,020
you can ask Mr. Shen

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
to tell me.

218
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
What are you?

219
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Mr. Shen's dog?

220
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
No.

221
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
What no?

222
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
You're a beta.

223
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,020
You're always with S and Alpha.

224
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
You're helping him to avoid the peach blossom.

225
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Who knows what you're thinking?

226
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
I suspect you're trying to

227
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
get Mr. Shen's attention.

228
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
You're a coward.

229
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Shameless.

230
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Gao Tuo.

231
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Why are you

232
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
talking to Omega?

233
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Leave now.

234
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
I'm going to throw up.

235
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Omega is the worst.

236
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
When Xia Tuo came to work,

237
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
he washed himself clean.

238
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
You don't know

239
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
how strong Omega is.

240
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
Don't bring Alpha

241
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,020
to get close to Omega.

242
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Shameless.

243
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Hello.

244
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Dad.

245
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Gao Tuo.

246
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
Why did you answer the phone

247
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
so late?

248
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
I've been

249
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
into a big business recently.

250
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,020
It's very profitable.

251
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
I just

252
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,020
need some capital.

253
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
If you want it,

254
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
take some more.

255
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Or call my

256
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
original bank card.

257
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
How much do you want?

258
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
Not much.

259
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
100,000 is enough.

260
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
100,000?

261
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Are you going to bet money again?

262
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
What?

263
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Is it a lot?

264
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,020
You're working in a big company.

265
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,020
You must make a lot of money.

266
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
What?

267
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,020
You won't even give me 100,000?

268
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
I'm so useless to have you.

269
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,020
You're useless.

270
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Dad.

271
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm just a worker.

272
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
It has nothing to do with me.

273
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
Besides, Xiao Qin is still in the hospital.

274
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Okay.

275
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Xiao Qin

276
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
has been a sick man since he was a child.

277
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
He only drags us

278
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
to the hospital.

279
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
He's not getting better.

280
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
In my opinion,

281
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
it's just a waste of money.

282
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
It's a burden on us.

283
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
It's better to give up treatment earlier.

284
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
What are you talking about?

285
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Xiao Qin is your daughter.

286
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Okay, okay, okay.

287
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Fine, fine, fine.

288
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
If you're willing to treat her,

289
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
then treat her.

290
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,020
Okay?

291
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
Then the money I want,

292
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
when can you transfer it to me?

293
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
I don't have that much.

294
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
I'll give you 2000 at most.

295
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,020
What?

296
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
2000?

297
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
2000 is enough?

298
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
You're making so much money,

299
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
but you don't want to give it to your dad?

300
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
In a word,

301
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
how many shares do you want to sell?

302
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
I'm telling you,

303
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
if you don't give me the money,

304
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
I'll go to your company to make trouble.

305
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,020
I'll see how you behave in the company in the future.

306
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay.

307
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
Whatever you want.

308
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,020
But after you're done,

309
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
I'll lose my job.

310
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
You don't even have the 2000.

311
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
You, you...

312
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Secretary Gao,

313
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
if possible,

314
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
you'd better come back a few days earlier.

315
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,020
Mr. Shen saw that you've been on leave recently.

316
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
You've been on a big fire.

317
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
You even said that

318
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
you don't need to come back in the future.

319
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
When you come back,

320
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
remember to explain to Mr. Shen

321
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
so that you won't be targeted in the future.

322
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Mr. Shen,

323
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Actually, he doesn't need me at all.

328
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
I've been watching him.

329
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
He won't give up.

330
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
He's like the moon.

331
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Shining.

332
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
Being surrounded by the stars.

333
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,020
And I...

334
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm just the most ordinary one

335
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
among the stars.

336
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
Sir,

337
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
this is the latest hot selling product in our store.

338
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
It's the A.B.O. Design series bath gel,

339
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
body lotion and shampoo.

340
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
It smells very good.

341
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
This is the smell of the mulberry.

342
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
This is the smell of the round.

343
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,020
We also have the smell of orchids and roses.

344
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
It's very funny.

345
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Sir,

346
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
this is the beta.

347
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
It doesn't have the smell of the original information speed.

348
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
You can try these products

349
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
according to your own taste.

350
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
The fragrance is very long.

351
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
If you buy a whole bottle,

352
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
you will get an extra information speed eGT.

353
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
That's right.

354
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
If you don't have a purchase requirement now,

355
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,020
you can also search for

356
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
All products in the convenience store

361
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
will be given the biggest discount

362
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
in our live broadcast room.

363
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Please help me settle the bill.

364
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I'll just buy the shopping cart.

365
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
I'll go buy something else.

366
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I'll go buy something else.

367
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
Hello.

368
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
Are you Si Baotai?

369
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,020
What?

370
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
You do the book sorting in the library in the morning.

371
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
You do the book sorting in the library.

372
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
You work as a server in KFC in the afternoon.

373
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
You work as a delivery man in the fruit supermarket in the afternoon.

374
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
You work as a cashier in the convenience store at night.

375
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Are we from the same school?

376
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
What is your summer homework?

377
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,020
Is it field research in the service industry?

378
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
One hundred thousand and twenty-four yuan.

379
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,020
Is it your hobby to work everywhere?

380
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
No, I...

381
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,020
This product sounds interesting.

382
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
Please introduce it to me.

383
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
This is the flavor we just added.

384
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
It's still in the promotion period.

385
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Buy a set

386
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
and get an extra information speed transfer.

387
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
and get an extra information speed transfer.

388
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Do you need it?

389
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
Help me get a bottle of this.

390
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
Let's settle the bill together.

391
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
School will start in a few days.

392
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Have you finished your summer homework?

393
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Can you make money from this kind of hard work?

394
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
It's a good thing to study hard.

395
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,020
Wen Lang, don't say that.

396
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,020
He is very trapped.

397
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Our private school is very expensive.

398
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
He has to rely on the scholarship from the foundation

399
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
of your family to maintain his life.

400
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
I'm sorry, Gaotu.

401
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Wen Lang didn't mean it.

402
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
It's okay.

403
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,020
It's Wen Lang.

404
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
You should get a bottle of drink less.

405
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
You didn't get the post-it you gave me.

406
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
It's for you.

407
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
Why?

408
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
You bought me the breakfast

409
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
that I put on the desk every morning

410
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,020
when I was online, right?

411
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Really?

412
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Gaotu, why did you buy breakfast for Shen Wen Lang?

413
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
Wen Lang doesn't eat breakfast.

414
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
And he can't eat

415
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
the kind of food that looks like it's added.

416
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
With the money,

417
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
why don't you buy yourself more lunch?

418
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,020
I eat less than cats.

419
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Don't buy me these in the future.

420
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
Eat more meat.

421
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
So thin.

422
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
It's so ugly.

423
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
I should have given up long ago.

424
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Shouldn't I continue to do

425
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
something that is impossible to achieve?

426
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
But

427
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
I can't give up.

428
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
I can't give up.

429
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
So you lied to me.

430
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
You've been trying to get the post-it

431
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
of the good Wu Jian.

432
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
I'm sorry.

439
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
The good Wu Jian's post-it

440
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
has been trying to maintain its identity

441
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
and maintain the false friendship.

442
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
But

443
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
the friendship that I lied to maintain

444
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
has been

445
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
already the limit.

446
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Shi Wen Lang,

447
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
I like you.

449
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
From the first quarter to now,

450
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
we've invested nearly 400 million.

451
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
But there's no result of Ming Lang.

452
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
The pressure on the board of directors is getting bigger.

453
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
Several shareholders have been thinking

454
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
Shengfang Biotech has been trying to

455
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
make the information-based fiber-based drug.

456
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
You're thinking too much.

457
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
What did the fish-fishing management say?

458
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
Not good.

459
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
The negative fish-fishing has affected our stock price.

460
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
What's worse,

461
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,020
HS Group has leaked a rumor

462
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
that there's a special order from the related departments.

463
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Their drug is expected to be

464
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
released in the market

465
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
in two years through three-stage experiments.

466
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
But maybe it's just a false record

467
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,020
that HS Group has released

468
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
to stimulate the stock price.

469
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Mr. Sheng,

470
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
don't worry too much.

471
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
How can I not worry?

472
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
The market is burning.

473
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
But there's no progress.

474
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
In order to give the lab

475
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
too much power,

476
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
I've promoted the reform of the technology center.

477
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
I've moved the cakes of the board of directors.

478
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
If this goes on,

479
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
the voices of internal opposition will only get louder.

480
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Shengfang will be out of the room sooner or later.

481
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Several leaders of the lab

482
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,020
have issued military orders

483
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
to let everyone work overtime

484
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
and get to the point.

485
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
The personnel

486
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
have been actively recruiting

487
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
the relevant experts.

488
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Mr. Sheng,

489
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
there's one more thing.

490
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
What?

491
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
We received the news.

492
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
The relevant person in X-Control Group

493
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
will be back in Jianghu soon.

494
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
They may be looking for new partners.

495
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
What's the news?

496
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
I've confirmed it.

497
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
They will organize a special meeting

498
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
and have sent an invitation to all the biotech companies

499
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
in Jianghu.

500
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Mr. Sheng,

501
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
I heard

502
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
that the man will come to Jianghu in person

503
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
to meet with the last partner.

504
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Really?

505
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
That's great.

506
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
As long as we can

507
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
join the X-Control Group,

508
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
and share the patent technology of the drug,

509
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
it won't be so passive.

510
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I don't believe that

511
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,020
we can't get what Shen Wenlang can get.

512
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
But...

513
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
But what?

514
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
Shen Fang Biotech is not on the invitation list.

515
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Why?

516
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,020
The PR team is still investigating the reason.

517
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
It's really strange.

518
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
After all, there are many companies

519
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
far from our level on the invitation list.

520
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Report to me as soon as you find out the reason.

521
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Okay, Mr. Sheng.

522
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
Chen Pingping,

523
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
who is the representative of X-Control Group?

524
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
It's Chang Yu.

525
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Chang Yu.

526
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Okay.

527
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
I got it.

528
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
You can leave now.

529
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Mr. Sheng,

530
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
your period is coming.

531
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
You look tired.

532
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Take care of yourself.

533
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Nothing is more important than health.

534
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Okay, I got it.

535
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
Thank you.

536
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
Why can't I get rid of the cold

537
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
without giving the invitation?

538
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Last time, on the night of President Zhang's death,

539
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Chang Yu and I had a fight.

540
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
We didn't punish him.

541
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
How could we be targeted?

542
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Mr. Sheng,

543
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
I'm the technical director of Huan Yu Biotech.

544
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm Jiu Yang.

545
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Hello.

546
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Why don't you go

547
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
and say hello to Mr. Sheng?

548
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Take a closer look at Mr. Sheng's background.

549
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
What is he?

550
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
A postman?

551
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Yes.

552
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Mr. Sheng is about to get married.

553
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
He is S-level Alpha.

554
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
I'm B-level Alpha.

555
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,020
I rarely get in touch with him during my special period.

556
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
I'm not playing around

557
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
when I'm pressed by S-level A.

558
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Mr. Sheng.

559
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Mr. Sheng.

560
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Is Chang Yu here?

561
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Yes.

562
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
But he didn't go to the main gate.

563
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
He came into the VIP lounge from the side gate.

564
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,020
There are several bodyguards at the door of the lounge.

565
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Several acquaintances of Chang Yu

566
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
were blocked back.

567
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
We'd better not touch this place.

568
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Find a chance to drink some wine in private.

569
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
Okay.

570
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
Mr. Sheng.

571
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,020
What's wrong?

572
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
Nothing.

573
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,020
I don't know why

574
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
but this time,

575
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
I feel different from usual.

576
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
I'm under control.

577
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
You sweat a lot on your back.

578
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Your body is wet from the postman.

579
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
I brought some spare ones.

580
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
Do you want to wash your hands and change new ones?

581
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Okay.

582
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Mr. Sheng.

583
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Secretary Chang.

584
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
I'm sorry.

585
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
Mr. Sheng is inside.

586
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Mr. Sheng is so generous.

587
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,020
He even used the toilet

588
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
to press the toilet paper.

589
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
He has the whole bathroom.

590
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
The arrogance and greed of the other creatures

591
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
is what I can understand.

592
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Mr. Sheng.

593
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
You look pale.

594
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
It smells like a cold flower.

595
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Mr. Sheng, are you not feeling well?

596
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Go to sleep on the bed, okay?

597
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
I feel so bad.

598
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
I know.

599
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
I'll help you to sleep on the bed, okay?

600
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
I'm fine.

601
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
I'll be right back.

602
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
I'm going to sleep.

603
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
I'm going to sleep.

604
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
I'm going to sleep.

605
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
I'm going to sleep.

606
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Okay.

607
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
Thank you, Secretary Chang.

608
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Leave Mr. Sheng to me.

609
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
You go back first.

610
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
I'll take good care of him.

611
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
I feel so bad.

612
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
Mr. Sheng, let go of my hand.

613
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
How can I help you change clothes?

614
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
Don't worry.

615
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
I don't want to take off my clothes.

616
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I'll sleep like this.

617
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
How can you sleep without changing clothes?

618
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
It will be uncomfortable.

619
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,020
I'm not sleepy.

620
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
And...

621
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
I feel so bad.

622
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
I feel so bad.

623
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Don't you feel bad?

624
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
I do.

625
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Of course I do.

626
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Mr. Sheng, lie down first.

627
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Like my massage messages?

628
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Mr. Sheng, have a good dream.

629
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Good night.

630
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Good night.

631
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Mr. Sheng,

632
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
there's a rumor that

633
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,020
HS Group has set up a anti-corruption group

634
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
to investigate the core members

635
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,020
who are specifically for information speed.

636
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
It's making people panic.

637
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Do you think

638
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
we should take the opportunity

639
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
to strengthen our own stockpile?

640
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,020
It's a waste of time.

641
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
It's a waste of time.

642
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
You should let HR Group

643
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
set up a special group

644
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
to take advantage of their inner panic

645
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
and find a way to dig some core shares.

646
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,020
Okay.

647
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
But,

648
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
HS's confidential work is too good.

649
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
We can only find

650
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
the target who was investigated

651
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
is basically in the research group.

652
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
What about the list?

653
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
The specific list is still under investigation.

654
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
But it's difficult.

655
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Chen Bingbing.

656
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Yes.

657
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
I don't look at the difficulty, I only look at the result.

658
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
You can do this by yourself.

659
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
Within a month,

660
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
I want to get the list of core members.

661
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
No matter what the price is.

662
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Okay, Mr. Sheng.

663
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Hello.

664
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Hello, Shao You.

665
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Your first-time period is coming.

666
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Let's go on a vacation together this time.

667
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
Okay?

668
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
I've told you

669
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
not to contact me again.

670
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Shao You.

671
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
I know you don't like me going out to play.

672
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
But I've changed.

673
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
What does it have to do with me?

674
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,020
Don't say that.

675
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
I know.

676
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
You're with that

677
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
orchid-flavored Omega.

678
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Brother Boqiao told me.

679
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,020
The love between the Panbo La Group is very romantic.

680
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
But Shao You.

681
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
You're an Alpha of S class.

682
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,020
You don't have to carry the first-time period alone, do you?

683
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
How I spend my first-time period,

684
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
and with who,

685
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
it's none of your business.

686
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
We're just friends for a few days.

687
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,020
If you want me to pay you a few more bills,

688
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
you can contact my secretary.

689
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
If there's nothing else,

690
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
don't call me.

691
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
What else?

692
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
Shao You.

693
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm Boqiao.

694
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Why are you so angry?

695
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Who's bothering you?

696
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Stop using my privacy to promote.

697
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
My anger will be lower.

698
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
That won't do.

699
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
You know my personality.

700
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Don't tell me about the confidential things.

701
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I can't hide it.

702
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
By the way,

703
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
you don't know about the secret of the secret.

704
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
I'm not going to tell you.

705
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
I'm going to tell you.

706
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I'm going to tell you.

707
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
I'm going to tell you.

708
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm going to tell you.

709
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
I'm going to tell you.

710
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
I'm going to tell you.

711
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
I'm going to tell you.

712
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
I'm going to tell you.

713
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
Aren't you almost there?

714
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
I'm going to Piguo for a few days.

715
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
Do you want to come with me?

716
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Piguo's entertainment industry is very developed.

717
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
There are many beautiful megalomaniacs.

718
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
No.

719
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
Why not?

720
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Go or not?

721
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
There are many people.

722
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
I'll go with you.

723
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
Boqiao, don't force Shao You.

724
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
You know that

725
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Shao You never goes to Piguo.

726
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Just take it as a favor.

727
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Let's go together.

728
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
No.

729
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
What did I say?

730
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
You've been rejected by Wu Qing?

731
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
I know he doesn't like Piguo.

732
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
I just want to help him overcome it.

733
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Just because he lost his ancestral

734
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
arm when he was a kid,

735
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,020
he hates Piguo completely.

736
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,020
Our Mr. Sheng's heart

737
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
is really smaller than a hole.

738
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,020
Come on.

739
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
Hua Yong, what are you doing here?

740
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
What's that look on your face?

741
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
So noisy.

742
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
Who are you?

743
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Come out!

744
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
What's wrong with you?

745
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
I'm here.

746
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
I'm here.

747
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
I'm here.

748
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
I'm here.

749
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
I'm here.

750
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
I'm here.

751
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
I'm here.

752
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
I'm here.

753
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
I'm here.

754
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm here.

755
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
I'm here.

756
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
I'm here.

757
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
I'm here.

758
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
I'm here.

759
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
You're so noisy that I can't sleep.

760
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
And you dare to ask me who I am?

761
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Sheng Shao Yong?

762
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
You and Alpha

763
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
are bullying Omega.

764
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Come here.

765
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
Close your eyes.

766
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
It's just a tiger.

767
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
I scared it away.

768
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Don't be afraid.

769
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
I didn't mean anything else.

770
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
I just gave you some sedatives.

771
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
You'll feel better.

772
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Don't be afraid.

773
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
Just stay quiet for a while.

774
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
It'll be fine in a while.

775
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
There's no smell of sedatives.

776
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
It's just a little bit of a smell.

777
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,020
It's just a little bit of a smell.

778
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
It's just a little bit of a smell.

779
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
There's no smell of sedatives.

780
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
You're not Omega.

781
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
You're Beta.

782
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
It's the first time I've seen such a cute Beta.

783
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Does sedatives help you?

784
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
No.

785
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm not Beta.

786
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,020
I just haven't been divided.

787
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
No wonder I can't smell you.

788
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
But I'm going to be divided.

789
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
What do you like?

790
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
I should go.

791
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Sheng Shao Yong.

792
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
What's up?

793
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
I'm going to get something and I'll be right back.

794
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Sheng Shao Yong, can you leave me a contact?

795
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
What? You want to thank me?

796
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
No need to thank me.

797
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
If you meet anyone who bullies you again,

798
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
don't stand still and don't move.

799
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Run if you can't beat them.

800
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,020
At least you can protect yourself.

801
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
That's it.

802
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Goodbye, kid.

803
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
I'm sorry.

804
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Secretary Chen, do you want tea or coffee?

805
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
I'm fine with anything.

806
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
It's convenient for you.

807
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
I'm sorry.

808
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
I didn't ask you in advance.

809
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,020
I came straight here.

810
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
It's okay.

811
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
I'll make you a little coffee.

812
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
Okay.

813
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Thank you.

814
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Mr. Sheng went on a business trip.

815
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
He's afraid you're bored by yourself.

816
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
So he asked me to give you a book.

817
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
What book?

818
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
This one.

819
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
I just mentioned it to Mr. Sheng a while ago.

820
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
I said I've liked this book since I was a kid.

821
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,020
I've been wanting to read it a few more times.

822
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
I've been with Mr. Sheng for many years.

823
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,020
I can see that he cares about you.

824
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
Mr. Sheng is very good.

825
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
Secretary Chen.

826
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Did Mr. Sheng work because of Yi Gan Qi?

827
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
This is Mr. Sheng's personal schedule.

828
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
I'm not sure.

829
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
Personal schedule?

830
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,020
I know.

831
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
By the way, I baked cookies.

832
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
Do you want to eat it?

833
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Okay.

834
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,020
Then you're welcome.

835
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
You're welcome.

836
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
I baked two flavors.

837
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,020
You can try them.

838
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
Secretary Chen.

839
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
Secretary Chen.

840
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,020
Do you like the official documents we sent?

841
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
If you like them, I can give them to you.

842
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
This is Secretary Hua's document.

843
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,020
I thought it was Mr. Sheng's.

844
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,020
I want to help him fill in the name card.

845
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
At the last business banquet,

846
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
I asked him to give me a copy of the document.

847
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
He said he wanted to give it to me.

848
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
I'm not sure if he's going to give it to me.

849
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
I'm not sure if he's going to give it to me.

850
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
At the last business banquet,

851
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
Mr. Sheng found his name card house was empty.

852
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
He was very angry.

853
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
Mr. Sheng is sometimes not in a good temper.

854
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
It's hard for you to take care of him.

855
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
It's not hard.

856
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,020
It's all right.

857
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,020
Try it.

858
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
I just got it.

859
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,020
I suddenly remembered

860
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Mr. Sheng asked me to go to the lab again today.

861
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
Then I won't bother you.

862
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Work is definitely the most important.

863
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
Then I'll help you pack the cookies.

864
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Thank you so much.

865
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,020
I'm sorry.

866
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Come in.

867
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Mr. Sheng, your white tea.

868
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,020
You look so bad.

869
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
I'm fine.

870
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,020
What do you mean you're fine?

871
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,020
Have you looked in the mirror?

872
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
Is this face called nothing?

873
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,020
I'm sorry.

874
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
I may not sleep well recently.

875
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,020
I'm a little dizzy.

876
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
Dizzy?

877
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Gaotu, you're not a primary school student.

878
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
If your body is not well, you should go to see a doctor.

879
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
You don't even understand this.

880
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Gaotu, what are you doing?

881
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,020
I've seen a doctor.

882
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,020
I'm a primary school student.

883
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
I've eaten a lot.

884
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,020
I've been taking a few days of school classes.

885
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
I'm getting better.

886
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Mr. Sheng,

887
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,020
this is the summary of the next month's budget plan.

888
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
Gaotu.

889
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
Yes.

890
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
This is the financial report you made.

891
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,020
There's another reason for the summary of the budget plan.

892
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
Gaotu, are you blind?

893
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

894
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
I didn't check the information.

895
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Check?

896
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,020
I think you didn't put your mind at work at all.

897
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Even the soul was heated by that one.

898
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
I didn't dare to seduce you.

899
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
Even the numbers can be wrong.

900
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,020
I wouldn't make such a low-level mistake

901
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,020
even if I invited a primary school student.

902
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Mr. Sheng,

903
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,020
the financial report was made by the financial group and the purchasing group.

904
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
I just took it.

905
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,020
I'm sorry.

906
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,020
I was absent a few days ago.

907
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
So I couldn't check the report myself.

908
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,020
But...

909
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,020
The Deichess Group doesn't raise idle people.

910
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
I don't have time to listen to your excuses.

911
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,020
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,020
I'll make up for it right away.

913
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,020
Besides,

914
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
you should know that

915
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
I hate Omega.

916
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,020
Yes, I know.

917
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
Then why did you dare to

918
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
take Omega's smell

919
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
and enter my office?

920
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
I...

921
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
You're so stinky.

922
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
Get out.

923
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
Go back and wash yourself before you see me.

924
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

925
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
I'll be right back.

926
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,020
Thanks for your help.

927
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
Thanks.

928
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,020
I wonder who he's hanging out with.

929
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
He's trying to kill someone.

930
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,020
That Secretary Chen is so clumsy.

931
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,980
Been.

932
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,280
Engage you.

933
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,600
She's crazy.

934
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,600
YoYo English Channel YouTube

935
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Love is a trick, what a great trick

936
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Listen carefully, love is like a mountain

937
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Repeat, but not at all

938
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,600
It's so embarrassing, I want to be a joke

939
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

940
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Who will hug you for him

941
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Is it better than being angry

942
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

943
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
I don't know what to say in my mind

944
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I really want to think about it

945
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I don't know if I can walk

946
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,600
Who will hug me for him

947
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Who will be tamed

948
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
The one who is tamed is me

949
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,600
The one who is tamed is me

950
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Love is a trick, what a great trick

951
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Listen carefully, love is like a mountain

952
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,600
Repeat, but not at all

953
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:05,600
It's so embarrassing, I want to be a joke

954
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Don't be arrogant, how absurd

955
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Who will hug you for him

956
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Is it better than being angry

957
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,600
Don't be arrogant, how absurd
