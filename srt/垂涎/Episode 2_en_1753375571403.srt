1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,360
without love or truth

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
Don't forget Volkswagen

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,800
It's beginners')?

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,620
Endless tears

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,640
don't worry

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,800
With love

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,860
how to

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,120
love

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,220
the conversation

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,220
I'm not sure if I'm stupid or not

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,220
I'm so embarrassed

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,220
I want to be a joke

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,220
I'm willing to be arrogant

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,220
How absurd it is

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
A fake hug is like a crazy

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,220
Is it better than anger?

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Stop lying

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,220
Episode 16

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,220
There's so much sweat

20
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
There won't be any smell, right?

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,220
If I knew it earlier

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,220
I would have used the injection-based painkiller

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,220
It's useless

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,220
I could use it

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Secretary Hua

26
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,220
I'm Friday

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,220
Secretary Gao

28
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,220
president Jia

29
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,220
secretary Hua

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,220
These are the data for the meeting on Monday

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Thank you, Secretary Gao.

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,220
I went to see you during the holiday.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,460
You're welcome.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,820
If there's nothing else,

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,740
I'll leave first.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,020
I wish you a happy Chinese New Year.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,380
See you next week.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,980
Wait.

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,460
Secretary Gao is in such a hurry to go back.

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,860
Do you want to go back and continue to handle the case?

41
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

42
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,700
I suddenly asked for leave

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,260
and caused you trouble.

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,460
It's not a problem.

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,460
There are so many people in the Secret Service Team.

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,020
You can't get off the bus.

47
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,220
Yes.

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,300
Yes.

49
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,780
Is there anything else you want me to do?

50
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,780
When you come to work,

51
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,740
remember to wash yourself.

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,060
You don't know how strong

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,300
the omega-7 is on you.

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,140
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,940
Don't bring the omega-7 with you.

56
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,580
It stinks.

57
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,180
Why are you angry with me?

58
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,460
Give it back to me.

59
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,540
Wait.

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,620
Wait for me to brush Mr. Sheng's circle of friends.

61
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,820
There are only a few circle of friends in total.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,220
You've seen it more than a hundred times.

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,580
Give it back to me.

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Don't be so petty.

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,060
I'm petty?

66
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,380
I think you're sick.

67
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,340
You called me to help you move in the early morning.

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,620
And you moved to this shabby place.

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,740
Is it shabby?

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,660
I think it's okay.

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,860
It's not bad.

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,900
It's okay?

73
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,660
Then why don't you ask Mr. Sheng to live with you?

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,620
Why are you so angry?

75
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,580
Did you take the wrong medicine?

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,220
You're the one who took the wrong medicine.

77
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,500
But anyway,

78
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,380
why did you say that about Gao Mi Shuang?

79
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,300
The smell of her micro-fiber grass is very interesting.

80
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,100
Although it's not as fragrant as flowers or fruits,

81
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,620
it's not bad.

82
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,860
Why did you say that about her?

83
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,980
I said it stinks.

84
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,780
It's none of your business.

85
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,020
I've been working overtime.

86
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,500
Give me back my phone.

87
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm leaving.

88
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,500
You're so bad-tempered.

89
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,300
Be careful that no one likes you.

90
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,340
Just mind yourself first.

91
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm not like you.

92
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,020
I don't need anyone to like me.

93
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,300
Really?

94
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Captain, Christmas is coming.

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,480
yas year put in thousands of billions.

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,620
There's no progress in lumps势?

97
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,020
Are they to eat 안 up there?

98
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,720
Every leader for the research team works extra hours.

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,060
But the professors fabricate accelerator crossing fan.

100
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,860
The rate of the disease is five percent

101
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
but there is no special effect medicine

102
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Do you know what it means?

103
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
It means that as long as the patient is sick

104
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,860
the patient can only wait to die

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
It also means that the potential of this medicine is huge

106
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Now my dad also needs this medicine

107
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,820
We are the top biotech company in the country

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
We have invested a lot of human resources

109
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
but there is no progress in the research and development

110
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
We can only wait for the meeting of ten people

111
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,820
It's too messy

112
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Mr. Shen, we have already

113
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Chen Pingping

114
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,420
You should know how much the Shengfang Biotech is willing to invest in the R&D department

115
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
I have spent hundreds of billions

116
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
You are my secretary

117
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:17,060
but you are here to talk about the

118
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
Sorry, Mr. Shen

119
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,060
I am sorry

120
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Secretary Chen

121
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
I am not targeting you

122
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
The medicine that X-Control and HS cooperated with has not been listed yet

123
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Shen Wenlang has already

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,060
refused to cooperate with Shengfang so decisively

125
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
If we don't hurry up

126
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,060
and wait for their new medicine to be listed

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
in the drug field

128
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Shengfang Biotech will be in a more passive situation

129
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
This is what you as the head of the group

130
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
are willing to see

131
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
I am sorry

132
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Besides

133
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
my father is waiting for this medicine to save his life

134
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,060
If the research and development is not going well

135
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
the next meeting

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
I may only have to kneel down and talk to Shen Wenlang

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Shengfang Biotech's chairman

138
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
led the research and development of information

139
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
to invite the medicine

140
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
This was a big news

141
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Chen Pingping

142
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
You are a person with experience

143
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
You know it

144
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
Now we are

145
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,060
relying on others' efforts

146
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
to save my father's life

147
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
How ridiculous

148
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
If we can't make any breakthroughs

149
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Shengfang Biotech will be

150
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
humiliated by us

151
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Mr. Shen, it won't happen

152
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
I will organize the people of each group

153
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
to split the target

154
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,060
and send the task to each level of the lab

155
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
If there is any progress

156
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,060
I will report to you at any time

157
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Go back to your work

158
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Hello Shao Yang, I am not going

159
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
Are you free tonight?

160
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
I will go to the meeting

161
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
No

162
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
What's wrong?

163
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,060
You are in a bad mood

164
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,060
No matter how good I am

165
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
I can't go with you

166
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,060
What do you mean?

167
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
We are socializing

168
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
No socializing

169
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Rumor has it

170
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,060
that the ex-conquers

171
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
came to the world a few days ago

172
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
They might be at the Imperial Triad Society tonight

173
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
You have been trying to

174
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
get on the line of the ex-conquest

175
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Don't blame me for not telling you in advance

176
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
What time is it? What's the number?

177
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
It's been a long time since I played here

178
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,060
Yes

179
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
It's half past twelve

180
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
Shao Yang, don't go

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,060
Mr. UKW

182
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
might be on his way

183
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Wait a minute

184
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
What UKW?

185
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
The one who has always controlled

186
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
the ex-conquest's language

187
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
and never showed up

188
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
in the Imperial Triad Society

189
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
You know who

190
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
Boring, I am leaving

191
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Shao Yang, how long have you not

192
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
come out to play? Sit for a while

193
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
I tell you

194
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
For you

195
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
I have asked about a lot of information

196
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
about that mysterious person

197
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Is your information reliable?

198
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Of course

199
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
My brother said in the cooperation group

200
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
100% reliable

201
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
The ex-conquest's former name is

202
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Beichao Conquest

203
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Now the current head is the youngest son

204
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
of the old owner of Beichao Conquest

205
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
He is a illegitimate son

206
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
He is less than 30 years old

207
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
But don't look at his age

208
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
He is the one who took Beichao Conquest

209
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
from the local dragon head business

210
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
to the super giant bar

211
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
It is said

212
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,060
that mysterious person is strange

213
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
very low-key

214
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
never socialize

215
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
No one knows what he looks like

216
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
and there is something more strange

217
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
What?

218
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
It is said that

219
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
the first thing that this mysterious person

220
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
got before he spoke

221
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
is to change Beichao Conquest

222
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
to the strange X

223
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Come, drink

224
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
Come, drink

225
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Wait

226
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
What can I do for you?

227
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
Sit here

228
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
and drink with me

229
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Sorry, I don't drink

230
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
You work in this kind of place

231
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
How can you not drink?

232
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
Don't worry

233
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
I will treat you well

234
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Sorry

235
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,060
I have to send something to the other room

236
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I will leave you alone

237
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
You have fun

238
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Now in the family of the P family

239
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
It can be said that

240
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
the father can be defeated and the father can be protected

241
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Why did he change his name?

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
Who knows

243
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
It is said that X represents mystery

244
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,060
The name was changed to

245
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
not to be seen by the real person

246
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
but to be called by the mysterious person

247
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
Really?

248
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
It may be a stupid mistake

249
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
Shao You

250
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
You are still the same as before

251
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
Don't you care about your own child?

252
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
As I said

253
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
The birth and appearance are given by parents

254
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
No wonder the child

255
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,060
My brother's partner in P

256
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,060
cooperated with this X Conquest

257
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,060
I have thought about it

258
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
This Mr. UKW

259
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
is very skilled

260
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
He is a top talent

261
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
No wonder he can easily

262
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,060
beat the other reporters of that old thing

263
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
The outside world also said

264
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
Mr. UKW is not willing to socialize

265
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
because he looks ugly

266
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
So he doesn't really look like a person

267
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Isn't it good not to see people?

268
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,060
The mouse in the conch should stay in the conch

269
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,060
Can't see the light of the dead

270
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,060
The dead

271
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
Even if one day it is on the top

272
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
it is still not hidden

273
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
Shao You

274
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Since you look down on the dead

275
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Why do you suddenly want to know

276
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,060
the X Conquest's painter

277
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,060
I have always been clear about the company

278
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
When necessary

279
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Don't say it's a dead child

280
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
As long as it is profitable

281
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
The cat can also do business with the mouse

282
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
You

283
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
I plan to go home alone tonight

284
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
I plan to take a

285
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
pitiful little guy with me

286
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
I tell you

287
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,060
I can let you choose a lot

288
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
No need

289
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
You can keep it yourself

290
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
A man with a good skin is a horse

291
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Meet Omega at the night market

292
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Be a partner can kill you

293
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
OK

294
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
I think tonight

295
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
The little fool in the conch won't come

296
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm leaving first

297
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
You continue

298
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
You look so good

299
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
Isn't it a pity to only send wine?

300
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
You play with me for a while

301
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
I have money

302
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
I'm sorry, I really can't

303
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
No

304
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
What are you pretending

305
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Don't give me a face

306
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Face

307
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Help me

308
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,060
A little Omega

309
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
Dare to reject me

310
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
what happened

311
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
It seems that two Alphas

312
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Robbed an Omega

313
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
That Alpha is releasing compressed oxygen

314
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
It's actually S-G

315
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Hurry up and close the door

316
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Come, Mr. Sheng

317
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,060
I am the operator of the Royal Heavenly Emperor's Club

318
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,060
I'm really sorry about today

319
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm sorry to bother you

320
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Xiao Hua, why are you still standing?

321
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
The first day of work, such a big basket

322
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
Hurry up and apologize to Mr. Sheng

323
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

324
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
I

325
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
No need to apologize

326
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
It's unfortunate to meet an unreasonable guest

327
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
But what's wrong with luck?

328
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Yes, yes, yes, Mr. Sheng

329
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
You are right, Mr. Sheng

330
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
In our service industry

331
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
There are not many people who can meet you

332
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Unreasonable and help

333
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
Xiao Hua met you

334
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
It's also his fortune

335
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Aren't you here

336
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
The most famous entertainment club in the world

337
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Why are you still doing that

338
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Thank you for the quality guests

339
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
You are leaving

340
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Are you going to make any money

341
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,060
No, no, no, no, Mr. Sheng, let me explain

342
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Today's matter is just a small mistake

343
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Like our Mr. Zheng often reminds you

344
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Sign your ten thousand instructions to tell us

345
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Mr. Sheng, you just come to our Tian Di Club

346
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Must be the highest standard

347
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
The one who made trouble today

348
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
We have already handed it over to Anbao

349
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Guarantee that you will not see him in the entertainment club

350
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
Xiao Hua

351
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
Hurry up and give Mr. Sheng a statement

352
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Today, Mr. Sheng has helped you a lot

353
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Thank you, Mr. Sheng

354
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,060
You see, Mr. Sheng, why don't you go back to the cabin first

355
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
I will send two people over

356
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Send two bottles of good wine

357
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Today's consumption, I will come

358
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
No need

359
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Then Mr. Sheng, your time is precious, you go slowly

360
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
Xiao Hua, hurry up and send Mr. Sheng

361
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,060
I didn't expect to meet you here

362
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Secretary Hua is really busy

363
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
Day and night

364
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
No need to explain

365
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
I am not interested in time

366
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Mr. Sheng

367
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
Can you give me your contact information

368
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
No

369
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
But

370
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
If you just want to thank

371
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
No need

372
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
Or

373
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
You want to go home with me

374
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
No

375
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I don't

376
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
You don't need to

377
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I am different from Mr. Sheng

378
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
I am not interested in what we are sent

379
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
So cute

380
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
Come in

381
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Mr. Sheng, Secretary Hua from HS Group just came to me

382
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Hua Yong

383
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Yes

384
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Secretary Hua asked me to give this to you

385
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Secretary Hua said

386
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
He found your embroidery nail without your contact information

387
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
So he contacted me

388
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Let me forward it to you

389
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Mr. Sheng, you go ahead

390
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
I will go out

391
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Mr. Sheng

392
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I found your embroidery nail in the river

393
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
I wanted to return it to you

394
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
So I asked you yesterday

395
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
To contact you

396
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
I didn't return it to you

397
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
I caused you trouble last night

398
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
I am really sorry

399
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Thank you for helping me

400
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
Thank you

401
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,060
Thank you

402
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Hello

403
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,060
I know

404
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
I will come right away

405
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
The president's situation was not good just now

406
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
But now all the indicators are relatively stable

407
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
But if there is no

408
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
Special effect drug for the information cell

409
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
The doctor can do very little

410
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
So

411
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
I am not afraid

412
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
I am not afraid

413
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
I am not afraid

414
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
I am not afraid

415
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
I am not afraid

416
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
So you mean

417
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
You can't cure it

418
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
You can only wait for death

419
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Then why are you here

420
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Mr. Sheng

421
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
We don't have special effect drug

422
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Don't be so arrogant

423
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
In the middle of the hall

424
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,060
Isn't this

425
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Mr. Sheng

426
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
This is the hospital

427
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
You will come here

428
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Where were you when my father was sick

429
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Did you cry a drop

430
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
After the president's position

431
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
The father's life is not important

432
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Second young master

433
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
You are wrong

434
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
The president has so many children

435
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Only Mr. Sheng is working in the group

436
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
Every day with a turtledoves

437
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Other young ladies

438
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Which one doesn't like to draw

439
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
If you like to shoot, shoot

440
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
If nothing, today is Tokyo

441
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Tomorrow, Paris is traveling around

442
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,060
But Mr. Sheng has not rested for three months

443
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Today is also his

444
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
I am talking to Sheng Shao You

445
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
What are you

446
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
It's too much

447
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
Secretary Chun

448
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
No need to waste time with boring people

449
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Waste time

450
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
OK

451
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Then I let

452
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
Don't waste time

453
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Sheng Shao You, chairman

454
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Help me answer a question

455
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
I remember a year ago

456
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
You have already let the research team

457
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
To develop special effects drugs

458
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Where is the drug

459
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Give it to me

460
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Hey, talk

461
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Special effects drugs are not just available

462
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
The development of drugs also requires a certain process

463
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
From development, case

464
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
To clinical trials

465
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Every ten years is a dream

466
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
I see

467
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Sheng Shao You has no mouth, you have no eyes

468
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Do you want to go in and see if my dad can still have ten years

469
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
This is strange

470
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
After my father was hospitalized

471
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Everyone can come and control me

472
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
Enough

473
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
If you are slow

474
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Or you join in

475
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
The lab door has no door

476
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
You

477
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Did I say wrong

478
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
In addition to you, there are many private children of dad

479
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Sheng Shao Qi, Sheng Shao Ling

480
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Sheng Shao Yue, Sheng Sha Xi, and Sheng Shao Wan

481
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
As long as they are willing to join

482
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
The research team, I am always welcome

483
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
Why do you expect me to be alone

484
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
The child should be in the party

485
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Private children are invincible

486
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Right?

487
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Right

488
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
The child is great

489
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
The only difference between you and me is

490
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Your mother married my dad earlier

491
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Yes

492
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
It's great

493
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
When my mother and Sheng Fang

494
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Established Sheng Fang Biological

495
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Your mother was still in the royal family

496
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Sheng Shao Qing

497
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
While I have patience

498
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
I advise you to be more reserved

499
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
In case one day I don't want to

500
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
The bad stall left by my father

501
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
You

502
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
You

503
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Sheng Shao Qing

504
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,060
If you want to join the special effects research team

505
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
I am always welcome

506
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
But I want to be able to use your high school level

507
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
I'm afraid I can't make any constructive comments

508
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
Chen Ping Ming

509
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Prepare the car

510
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
Yes

511
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Why are you standing there

512
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Come up

513
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,060
Thank you Mr. Sheng

514
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
Mr. Sheng

515
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
I have told you the general situation

516
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
The surgery fee must be paid within this week

517
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Otherwise, your sister's surgery

518
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Can only be delayed

519
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Doctor, can you

520
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Can you pay the fee after the operation

521
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,060
Really sorry

522
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Your sister's situation

523
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
I personally feel very sorry

524
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
But the surgery fee is 600,000

525
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
The fee is indeed not in accordance with the rules of our hospital

526
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Besides

527
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,060
You still have the bill on the billboard

528
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,060
I can keep your sister's

529
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
291 bed is already good

530
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
Sorry doctor

531
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Thank you

532
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,060
I will try my best to collect the surgery fee

533
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Congratulations

534
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Congratulations

535
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Your company's treatment is not very good

536
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,060
The picture is working in the morning

537
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
In the evening, I am working in the boss's office to adjust the situation

538
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
I have to go to the night market to sell wine in the morning

539
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Such a hard work

540
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,060
But I can't get 600,000

541
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
I think you don't have to go to the Tianli Club to drink

542
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Go to Shen Wen Lang

543
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Just pick up the watch

544
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
More than 600,000

545
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
Mr. Sheng

546
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
I am in the entertainment office

547
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,060
It's right to be a service

548
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
But I didn't drink

549
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
And I and Shen Zong

550
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Just ordinary colleagues

551
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Last night, I wanted to contact you

552
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
I have no other meaning

553
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
I just want to return the fixer to you

554
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Can you stop thinking about me so badly?

555
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,060
It turned out to be an ordinary colleague

556
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
Why didn't you say it earlier?

557
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
The doctor said that his sister was in the patient bed

558
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
No.291

559
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Hello

560
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
This is the bill for No.291

561
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Can you

562
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Help me to do the check-up?

563
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
I will pay you back as soon as possible

564
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
No.291 has no visa record

565
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
And I also paid 600,000

566
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
Surgery fee and post-op nutrition fee

567
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,060
What?

568
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Pay back?

569
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,060
Yes, you are No.291's family

570
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Your friend just paid for you

571
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
My friend?

572
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Did you make a mistake?

573
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
I don't know

574
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
I have a deep impression of your friend

575
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,060
He is a very tall and handsome S-level Alpha

576
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I have confirmed his bed number several times

577
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,060
He can't be wrong

578
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,060
Very tall and handsome S-level Alpha

579
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Is it Mr. Shen?

580
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Next

581
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Come in

582
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Mr. Shen

583
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,060
The meeting this afternoon

584
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
I have requested the development team to participate

585
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
The meeting location from 201 media room

586
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,060
To the big meeting room

587
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Mr. Shen

588
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,060
What's up?

589
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Thank you

590
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
For paying the surgery fee for my sister

591
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I will pay back the money

592
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
That

593
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,060
It's nothing

594
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,060
Don't worry

595
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Thank you so much

596
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
You are welcome

597
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
You can pay back the money

598
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Just don't let the omega smell

599
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Come to my office

600
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I have 15 minutes left

601
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
You go to work

602
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
Ok

603
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
I will prepare for the meeting

604
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Mr. Sheng

605
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Finally, you are willing to bring your new friend out

606
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Beauty

607
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,060
What's your name?

608
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Shu Xin

609
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
You look like a moon

610
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Your name is also nice

611
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Thank you

612
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Bai Shao Yang

613
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
You have changed a lot recently

614
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,060
What?

615
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Why do you suddenly bring a flower-flavored omega

616
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Don't you always like fruit-flavored omega

617
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
I have told you that

618
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,060
You don't listen

619
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Why do you suddenly change your mind

620
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
You like the smell of flowers

621
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Mr. Sheng

622
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Help me

623
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,060
The smell of flowers

624
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
It's okay

625
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,060
I will go to the office

626
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Mr. Sheng is really busy

627
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Someone will come at 10 o'clock on the weekend

628
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Is it going back to work?

629
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,060
Hello Mr. Sheng

630
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I am Hua Yong

631
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
I asked for your phone

632
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
I have something urgent to find you

633
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Mr. Sheng

634
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Sorry to bother you

635
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
No

636
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Who is Hua Yong?

637
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
A stranger called you

638
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
What if it's a scam

639
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Mr. Sheng

640
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,060
Are you busy

641
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,060
I'll call you later

642
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
No need

643
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,060
You say

644
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
Did you pay the surgery fee for me?

645
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,060
I don't know why you did this

646
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,060
But I really thank you

647
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,060
I will pay you back as soon as possible

648
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Except money

649
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,060
You have nothing else to say to me

650
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Mr. Sheng

651
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
Do you have time this Saturday?

652
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
I want to treat you to a meal

653
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,060
Don't lie to you

654
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Make me look like a six-year-old

655
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
I am not a six-year-old

656
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,060
Make me look like a six-year-old

657
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
Sorry

658
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Then ask Mr. Sheng

659
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
Are you free this Saturday?

660
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,060
Saturday

661
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,060
Already have an appointment

662
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
Then we will change the day

663
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
I have an appointment with a friend on Saturday

664
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
You come to my place on Sunday

665
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,060
Secretary Hua is not convenient

666
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,060
Forget it

667
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
No sincerity

668
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
No, I am convenient

669
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Then thank you Mr. Sheng

670
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
You send me the specific time and address

671
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,060
You send me the specific time and address

672
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
it is good

673
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
Really

674
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Shao Yang, you give me an honest explanation

675
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
This is how I met

676
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
Which way is this Hua Yong

677
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Can make us never answer strange calls

678
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Mr. Sheng is willing to break the law

679
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Drink your wine

680
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
Hello, sir, we are a private club

681
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
Sorry, I came to find a friend

682
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Do you have an invitation card?

683
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,060
I don't know if I need an invitation card to enter

684
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Sorry, you don't have an invitation card

685
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
Can't let you in

686
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,060
But Mr. Sheng asked me to come

687
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,060
I want to see Mr. Sheng's liar

688
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,060
From here to New York

689
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
I am not a liar

690
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Since you said it was Mr. Sheng's friend

691
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
Then please call him

692
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Hello, please go to another place

693
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
This is the entrance

694
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Hua Yong

695
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,060
Mr. Sheng

696
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Mr. Sheng

697
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,060
Why are you here?

698
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
No. 2 is in the parking lot

699
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Sorry, I'm late

700
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
It's okay, come in

701
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
What are you doing?

702
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Come here

703
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

704
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
You told me it was a friend meeting

705
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
I thought

706
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
I didn't know it was such an official occasion

707
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
If you are not convenient

708
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
I will leave now

709
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Leave

710
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
That's it

711
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,060
It's good

712
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Didn't Shen Wen Lang take you to the party?

713
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
No

714
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
I just joined

715
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Mr. Shen usually takes Secretary Gao to the party

716
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
So

717
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Today is your first time

718
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Hello, Mr. Sheng

719
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Mr. Sheng

720
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
I won't go

721
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Why?

722
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
I don't look good in this

723
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
What's wrong?

724
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
It's embarrassing

725
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
It's a little

726
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
It's a little

727
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
It's a little

728
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
I'll leave today

729
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
I'll invite you to dinner next time

730
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
You are here

731
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,060
I'm so embarrassed

732
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
It's okay to be a little embarrassed

733
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,060
You can invite me in a few days

734
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
But

735
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
It's nothing

736
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
You are so embarrassed

737
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,060
If I were alone

738
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
I would be more embarrassed

739
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Let's go

740
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,060
I'm leaving

741
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,060
I'll invite you to dinner next time

742
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Remember to dress well

743
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Next time?

744
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Next time?

745
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Mr. Sheng

746
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,060
I don't have any other clothes

747
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Clothes are not simple

748
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,060
I'll ask Chen Ping Ming

749
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
to take you to pick some good clothes

750
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Shao You

751
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,060
I've been looking for you for a long time

752
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Why don't you come in?

753
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,060
Let's go

754
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Come on, eat this

755
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,060
Thank you

756
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
Yushan

757
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
I think the next gathering

758
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
It's better to do it at your club

759
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
No problem, next time I'll go to our club

760
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
I'll arrange it

761
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,060
I'll arrange the gathering

762
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
It's not so hot if you don't come

763
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
I didn't have time to ask just now

764
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
This is

765
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,060
Looking at Yansheng

766
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
First time meeting

767
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Where did you get the baby

768
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,060
after a few days?

769
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,060
Where did you get me from?

770
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
This is also Hua Xuan

771
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Why are you so fierce?

772
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
I'm sorry

773
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
No, I just smell it

774
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Don't be angry

775
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
Okay, Bo Xiang, don't do this

776
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
He's a mega

777
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
You should ask him in private

778
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Don't scare your new friend

779
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Okay, I'm not coming

780
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
I'll ask your name

781
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
I think it's okay

782
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
I'll ask your name

783
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
What's your name?

784
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Hua Yong

785
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
You are Hua Yong

786
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
The one who made Sheng Shao You

787
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
willing to answer a strange call

788
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Long time no see

789
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
In front of me

790
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,060
harass my friend

791
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,060
Can you be normal?

792
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,060
You had so many friends before

793
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,060
I'm all harassed

794
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Why are you so angry today?

795
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
Can you touch it?

796
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
Can you eat less meat?

797
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Bo Xiang

798
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
Shao You rarely comes to your social dinner

799
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
If you don't behave well

800
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,060
He won't come again

801
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,060
I won't touch his fire treasure

802
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
How about this

803
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,060
Drink alcohol

804
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Okay

805
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Drink

806
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
You are drunk

807
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
It's not safe to go back alone

808
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I'll send you

809
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,060
to the hospital

810
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060
Right, Mr. Sheng

811
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,060
This is my plan to return the money

812
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,060
I know

813
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
It may take a long time

814
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,060
And the interest is not high

815
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
I didn't mortgage

816
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,060
The interest should be higher than the bank

817
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060
But

818
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,060
After I return the capital

819
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
I will calculate the total amount of the bank's four times the interest

820
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
Continue to return interest

821
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Until the end

822
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
I have a faster way

823
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,060
Sorry

824
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,060
My salary is limited

825
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,060
Before I have a raise

826
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
This is the fastest way

827
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
Hua Yong

828
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Come to be my friend

829
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
If you agree

830
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,060
I don't need you to return this money

831
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

832
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,060
I may be a little slow

833
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
But I will return it to you as soon as possible

834
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Okay

835
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
Hua Yong

836
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
I have a meeting

837
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
I'll go back to work

838
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Okay

839
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
I'll go back to work

840
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
I'll go back to work

841
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
Goodbye

842
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
Goodbye

843
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Hua Yong

844
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
I'm sorry

845
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060
I'm sorry

846
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,060
If you break up one day

847
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
You must tell me

848
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,060
I don't mind

849
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Mr. Sheng

850
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
I'm here

851
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,060
I don't need it

852
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,060
The road here is not safe

853
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
I'm afraid I will dirty your shoes

854
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,060
I'm leaving

855
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,460
I don't care about the words.

856
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,180
You're gentle. Don't forget to remember me.

857
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,100
Only make the hurt of the city.

858
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,900
Tears are all in the eyes.

859
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
Don't be nervous.

860
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,420
It's not a big deal. Let's go crazy.

861
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,180
Use love to make a mistake.

862
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,100
What a great way.

863
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,500
Listen carefully to the cry of love.

864
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,060
Repeat stupidity but don't understand the embarrassment.

865
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,660
Love is like a joke.

866
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,500
Don't be arrogant.

867
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,420
How ridiculous and unfaithful.

868
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,980
Who will hug you for him?

869
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,180
Make you crazy.

870
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,660
Kissing is better than being angry.

871
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,660
Don't say that again.

872
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Don't forget to remember me.

873
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,060
Only make the hurt of the city.

874
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,860
Tears are all in the eyes.

875
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,100
Don't be nervous.

876
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,540
It's not a big deal. Let's go crazy.

877
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,580
Use love to make a mistake.

878
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,660
What a great way.

879
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,500
Listen carefully to the cry of love.

880
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,020
Don't be arrogant.

881
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,060
Let's go crazy.

882
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,460
Use love to make a mistake.

883
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,740
Don't be arrogant.

884
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
How ridiculous and unfaithful.

885
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
Who will hug you for him?

886
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,740
Make you crazy.

887
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,740
Kissing is better than being angry.

888
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,740
Don't say that again.

889
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Don't forget to remember me.

890
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,740
Only make the hurt of the city.

891
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,740
Don't be arrogant.

892
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,740
Let's go crazy.

893
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,220
The flowers are not blooming.

894
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,020
The heart is like a whirlpool.

895
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,020
Who said I could tame him?

896
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
Who was tamed by whom?

897
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:14,020
I was the one who was tamed.

898
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,020
Use love to make a mistake.

899
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,020
What a great way.

900
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,020
Listen carefully to the cry of love.

901
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Don't be arrogant.

902
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,020
Let's go crazy.

903
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,020
Use love to make a mistake.

904
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,020
Don't be arrogant.

905
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,020
How ridiculous and unfaithful.

906
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,020
Who will hug you for him?

907
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
Make you crazy.

908
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,020
Let's go crazy.

909
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,020
Use love to make a mistake.

910
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,020
Don't be arrogant.

911
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,020
How ridiculous and unfaithful.

912
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,020
How ridiculous and unfaithful.

913
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,020
Who will hug you for him?

914
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,020
Make you crazy.

915
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,020
Kissing is better than being angry.

916
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,020
Don't say that again.

917
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
Don't say that again.

918
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:18,020
The End
