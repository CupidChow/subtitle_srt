If you see someone handsome, your evaluation changes.

He's better than just good.

53
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,520
And if you see someone handsome, you like him even before he starts singing.

54

What? Have you already fallen for him?

55
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,220
He's handsome and he sings well, of course.

Um... by chance... is it urgent?

62

If it's not, can I go to the recording studio?

63
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,520
Why the recording studio?
