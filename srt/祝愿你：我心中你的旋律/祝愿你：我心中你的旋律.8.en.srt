â™« When you didn't know me, I was praying â™«

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,000
â™«  May your eyes always reach me  â™«

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,730
â™«  As much as I try to get close to you, the farther away you go  â™«

11
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,910
â™«  You wouldn't know how I feel  â™«

12
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,940
â™«  You know about it, but I wonder why you're like that. 
 Maybe you're not used to it  â™«

13
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,900
â™«  I like everything about you  â™«

14
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,570
â™«  I want to be the one who can see you when I want 
 and can be with you when you need me  â™«

15
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,510
â™«  I want to be that precious person to you  â™«

16
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:03,000
â™«  You're the one who changed me, 
and you are too good for me  â™«

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,360
â™«  If you were mine,  â™«

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,090
â™«  I'd be so happy  â™«

19
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:33,170
â™«  You know everything, but you're pretending not 
to know and trying to avoid it,  â™«

20
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,890
â™«  and even that's so pretty to me  â™«

21
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:47,550
â™«  I want to be the one who can see you when I want 
 and can be with you when you need me  â™«

and you are too good for me  â™«

24
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,870
â™«  I wish you were mine   â™«

25
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,560
â™«  I'm not a good person, but when I'm next to you, â™«

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,260
â™«  I become a good person like you  â™«

27
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,920
â™«  I want to be the one who can see you when I want

â™«  If you don't do anything, and just stay next to me  â™«

32
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,510
â™«  is perfect for me  â™«

33
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,350
It's me. Kang In Soo.

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:28,000
â™«  I want you to come closer to me  â™«

35
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,370
Why is this bullshit happening only to me?

36
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,730
- In Soo. 
 - Why do you look so out of shape?

37
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,210
Kang In Soo, it's you. Right?

38
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,740
Why? Did you think I would do something bad?

39
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,300
Why are you like this? I'm Kang In Soo with unfounded confidence.

40
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,540
Let's go.

41
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,550
I wanted to show my dad.

42
00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:00,440
No matter how much he tried to prevent it, I wanted to show him that I could do it.

43
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,370
Without his help, I wanted to declare that I would live my own life.

44
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,490
But... then I met you.

45
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,770
When I was with you, I realized.

46
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:28,190
Real happiness comes from singing and making music with you.

47
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,910
Would you like to help me move forward again?

48
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,220
Don't disappear without a word again.

Let's go.

51
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,760
Let's go and make our own music.

52
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,400
Because they made music in a nice place, is that why the music came out nice?

53
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,830
Of course. It's overflowing with inspiration.

54
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,310
- Why aren't they coming. 
 - They're here.

55
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,920
What...?

56
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,030
I'm putting my life in the hands of two weirdos.

57
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,630
Me too!

58
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm not sure if it will get harder to make a living.

59
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,900
What do you mean, "get harder"?

60
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,720
I didn't come for you, I came here after seeing their potential.

61
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:59,380
â™« With heavy breathing, I'm running toward you â™«

62
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:06,480
â™« With the eyes that were shining with warm glows â™«

63
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:18,360
â™« Please don't go far away. I'm following our memories â™«

64
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:26,560
â™« I'm going to the place where we walked together â™«

65
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:37,890
â™« I wish for you (you're the reason) â™«

66
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,590
â™« I won't miss you for a second â™«

67
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:57,250
â™« I want you to (You believe me) â™«

68
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,220
â™« Dazzling, our names are sparkling â™«

69
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:17,240
â™« Even if we didn't say anything, we could feel it â™«

70
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,990
â™« That we would be together many days â™«
