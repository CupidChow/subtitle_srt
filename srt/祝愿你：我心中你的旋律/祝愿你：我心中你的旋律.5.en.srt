00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,680
- Are you... a pervert? 
 - What? No.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,060
No... It's not... I didn't try to see it.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,820
Your body... it looks really good.

11
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,360
You can unpack yourself.

12
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,060
The front door key.

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,040
But your house is really nice.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,880
The house? It's a house with a lot of stories.

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,410
Well, you'll find out when you stay with me.

16
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,570
Anyway, how old are you?

17
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,720
I was born in 1996.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,110
96?

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,350
We're the same age! No wonder I was drawn to you from the beginning.

20
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,210
Early 1996.

21
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,630
Then be a big bro.

22
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,190
My Chinese zodiac is a Rat.

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,220
What? Quickly choose.

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,420
Will you be my big bro or the same age?

25
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,200
Anything is good with me.

26
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,560
Then let's be friends. Let's be Year of the Rat friends.

27
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm counting on you.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,180
Why are you using two hands between friends?

â™« If it all comes crashing down, we'll be just fine â™«

30

â™« When the day and night collide, we'll stand and fight â™«

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,050
â™« If it all comes down to us, we'll be all right â™«

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,170
Yes, Deputy?

33
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,220
Yes, yes! I understand.

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,890
Yes.

35
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,620
She said to bring Mr. In Soo to the recording studio tomorrow.

36
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,850
Mr. In Soo?

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,320
In Soo... you.

38
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,030
â™« So let's find it out for each other â™«

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,350
â™« Let's reach inside deep down â™«

40
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,880
â™« And pull up all that the... â™«

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,650
Yes, Deputy?

42
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,840
Just a moment.

43
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,800
We were just about to start now.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,250
In Soo?

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,130
Yes. Well, there's not much else.

46
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,570
Did something happen?

47
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,390
It's hard to make a living. Geez.

48
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,300
Why? Did he say something to you?

49
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,970
No, it's not that.

50
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,220
Is that guy insane?

51
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,520
Does he think he's Beethoven or Mozart?

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,990
Does he think he's the only one who's mad?

53
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,680
I've been doing music for so many years.  Ah, my pride is hurt.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,690
Sang Yi, listen carefully.

55
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,090
Go and tell him

56
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,050
that if he doesn't come back in an hour, he's finished.

57
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,030
In Soo.

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,350
Say it.

59
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,080
I understand how you feel.

60
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,580
So, don't be like this. Let's go back and resolve it.

61
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,820
Resolve? Is this something we have to resolve?

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,360
I think the producer was a little embarrassed.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,900
Why? Are you worried about him?

64
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,690
It's not that. Good things are good, In Soo.

65
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,800
Did you even hear the arrangement?

66
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,630
I was answering the phone, so I didn'tâ€”

67
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,860
That's not my music.

68
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,630
It's just an arrangement. You're misunderstanding, In Soo.

69
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,650
I heard it. You didn't even listen to it.

70
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,400
And you're saying I'm the one misunderstanding?

71
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,250
I'm done. Go.

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,990
I'm sorry, but I'm going to talk, too, Kang In Soo.

73
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,100
Of course, I didn't hear the arrangement, but the company has its own plan.

74
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,770
The people who made that plan aren't trying to ruin you.

75
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,440
So, don't do thisâ€”

76
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,820
Do you know music?

77
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,180
Do you think I'm doing this to become famous?

78
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,220
Why I'm doing this.

79
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,210
Why I have to go this far.

80
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,920
Do you even know?

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm sorry. I think I screwed everything up.

82
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,950
What? Did you lose your fire already?

83
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,600
I think it's more fortunate this time that I got to see In Soo's artistic temperament.

84
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
And I set up the event on purpose.

85
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,880
Pardon? What do you mean on purpose?

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,940
I'm sorry. But don't you think I had to test if he was a real artist or not?

87
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,510
It was a little tough for the first day, but can you tell In Soo?

88
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,870
Go and tell him we'll make his kind of music.

89
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,310
You can support him, or you can get outside help, too.

90
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,620
But if you can't convince me, then we'll follow my way.

91
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:03,600
â™« I wish for you (you're the reason)  â™«

92
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:13,300
â™« I won't miss you for a second â™«

93
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:23,050
â™« I want you to (You believe me) â™«

â™« Dazzling, our names are sparkling â™«

95
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,940
You're here? You weren't here so I thought you weren't coming...

96
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,370
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,950
It was good.

98
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,860
More than the nonsense arrangement I heard in the recording studio,

99
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,840
your piano is much better.

100
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,880
Honestly, I didn't know what was missing, but I think you filled it.

101
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,740
I just... I didn't even do anything.

102
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,610
Yoon Sang Yi...

103
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,140
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,900
You're not going to accept my apology?

105
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,000
You don't have to apologize if it's me.

106
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,390
I'm the one who is sorry.

107
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:03,030
I asked a guy who's this good if he even knows music; of course, I'm more sorry.

108
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,940
Come on, this time, want to try and make it properly together?

109
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,960
Anyway, Deputy Lee said to try and make your music.

110
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,350
It was you.

111
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,840
What was?

112
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,070
I said it was you. My other half.

113
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,600
Should we try it together?
