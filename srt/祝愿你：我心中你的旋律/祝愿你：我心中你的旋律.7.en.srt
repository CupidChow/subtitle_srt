10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,230
Sorry.

Team Leader.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well done. The song is good.

34

Your approaching debut is the first in the company and the fastest, too.

35
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,080
You don't seem happy about it.

â™«  will become stars and shine on us  â™«

45
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,650
What kind of nonsense situation is this?

46
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,430
We have to stop the project, and not for just any reason,

47
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,030
- but because he's our company's parent company's CEO's son. 
 - I know, right.

48
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,560
Because the CEO doesn't want his son to be a singer, it seems like he has been telling some of the departments.

49
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,840
He must feel like he doesn't know what's going on right in his own company because his own son was under his label.

50
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,020
If we let him go, it would be a waste. Team Leader, isn't there something we can do?

51
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,630
Do you want to get fired? What can we do if the CEO says he doesn't want his son to be a singer.

52
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,490
Do you think you can release the song? And who will take responsibility for the investments?

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,840
You didn't know either? You didn't get any hint even while living with him?

54
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,260
The fact that he's the CEO's son! It's the shock of all shocks.

55
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,550
I don't understand. How can a father do this to his son?

56
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,480
He's his son.

57
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,340
The company shouldn't do this either.

58
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,760
 The person you're trying to reach is not available. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...

61

Now that everything is done, goodbye.

62
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,560
I don't want to face you like this, and I don't even want to imagine you leaving.

63

Goodbye. Take care.
