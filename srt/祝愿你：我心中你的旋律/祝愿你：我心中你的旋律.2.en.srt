Okay.

12
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,510
Did everyone go home?

13
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,310
Yeah, they left.

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,100
What happened? Did it go well?

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,480
Did you get a picture or something?

I'm curious about what you think of it.

20

Kang In Soo, should we do music together?

21
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,390
Your music is really nice.

Hey, why are you singing at this time?

Please, when I say it the first time.

48
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,590
Please be a little quieter, okay?

49
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,860
I apologize.

50
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,790
So be a little quieter!

Stop!

- Team Leader, if you listen to it a little moreâ€”  
 - Hey.

53
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,560
Am I an amateur?

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,920
You put the chorus in the intro. Why should I listen to more?

55
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,810
You're not hired to do the same every day.

56
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,360
Maybe you should try doing something different!

57
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,230
- Team Leader. 
 - What?

58
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,820
- Sang Yi. 
 - Yes.

59
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,460
Can you play Kang In Soo's video?

60
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,120
Yes.

â™«  I'm running toward you  â™«

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,180
He's still an unpolished gem, but I like him.

64
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,390
I think Kang In Soo has a lot of special charm

65
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,840
and I think it would be okay to try him out.

Team Leader.

70
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,700
The confidence to lead? The confidence to take responsibility. I'm asking if you have it.

71
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,370
If I'm given the chance, I want to try to make it.

72
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,690
If you need anything, then just ask. Try to make your project.

73
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,220
Our meeting is over.

74
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,630
Thank you, Team Leader.

75
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,240
- He's so handsome. 
 - This is the video we took. The edited one.

76
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,280
Watch it.

77
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,160
- He's attractive 
 - Right?

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,640
Go get his number.

79
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,330
- Then you go. 
 - What are you talking about?

80
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,680
Here. Kang Star's special coffee.

81
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,860
Leave it and go.

82
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,510
Then I'll be really disappointed.

83
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,990
Don't be like that. Drink and watch it.

84
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,980
It's nice here, isn't it?

85
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,130
Yes.

86
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,430
Sometimes when I'm frustrated, I walk here.

87
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,460
It's a hot place that only I know and I don't show it to anyone, but I'm especially showing it to you.

88
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,550
Thank you.

89
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,590
I have a reason for doing this, though.

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:16,160
Sang Yi, I hate beating around the bush so I'll just say it.

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,270
Okay, go ahead.

92
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,290
Do you want to do it with me?

93
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,630
â™«  If it all comes crashing down, we'll be just fine. â™«

94
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,530
Are you even thankful for all this?

95
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,150
Why are you so short-tempered?

96
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,520
Who made our cute Min Sung this mad?

97
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,450
Let go... Kang In Soo... before my fist goes flying.

98
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,630
Choi Min Sung, you're so terrifying.

99
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,670
Really. Let go.

100
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:57,190
Excuse me... Would it be possible to get your number?

101
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,560
Actually, I really built up the courage to ask...

102
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,700
- By any chance, do you have a girlâ€”  
 - He's taken.

103
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,920
In a relationship. We're getting married soon.

104
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,690
I'm sorry...

105
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,630
What are you talking about, I'm notâ€”

106
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,240
You're about to be a big star.

107
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
Do you think you can be in a relationship now?

108
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
You can't.

109
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,330
Choi Min Sung, you're definitely my manager.

110
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,330
Ah, seriously!

111
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,420
- This really became a habit of yours. 
 - Hey

112
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,520
They left!

113
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
Hurry and let go.

114
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,900
Just you try holding on.

115
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,100
My cheek is going to rip! Hurry up and let go!

116
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,360
- I told you to let go. 
 - Let go!

117
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,690
You're Kang In Soo, right?

118
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,030
