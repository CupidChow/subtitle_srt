[Wish You: Your Melody From My Heart]

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,580
Before we sign the contract, I will tell you the four conditions

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,250
that you must follow.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,550
Of course, they will be included in the contract.

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,590
"First, you'll be given a company dorm, and you have to follow the dorm rules."

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,720
"Second, you must delete any personal social media accounts like Facebook or Instagram,

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,350
or give control of the account to the company."

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,210
Because a rookie needs to have a certain mystique.

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,800
Why is that needed in this day and age?

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,650
"Third, 70% of the money you make goes to the company."

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,630
"Fourth, regarding the music, you must follow the company's directions."

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,690
Excuse me... Deputy Lee Yoo Jin?

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,190
I'm just telling you as Kang In Soo's long time managerâ€”

19
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,510
All of this, do I have to follow it?

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,890
This is standard for our company.

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,430
It would be nice if you followed it, but if there's something you would like to revise, then please tell me.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,190
I'll give control of my social media accounts to the company.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,970
But before I debut, please keep all my information private.

24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,110
This means, no outsiders will know my private information.

25
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,170
And as for living in the company dorms, I don't want to.

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,500
I want to keep living where I am.

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,480
Your reason?

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,460
I'm too lazy to move.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,550
Our In Soo, except in music,

30
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,290
he's kind of lazy.

31
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,670
He's really...

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,500
Okay. But you need to follow the rules of the company.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,720
Of course.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,550
I will appoint a company staff to live with you.

35
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,760
It doesn't matter.

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,200
Do you have no issues with the profit distribution?

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,340
The profit distribution,

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,080
I'll put my faith in you.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,700
More than the profit distribution, putting my music in an album,

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,060
and getting on the charts is more important to me.

41
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,190
If you can do that, then I'll accept all of the company's conditions.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,430
Why do you feel that way?

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,920
There is someone to whom I really want to show.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,720
A girlfriend?

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,990
Or... a lover?

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,360
I have to bring that, too.

47
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,020
What kind of situation is this?

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,660
But... is it okay to decide the staff that will live with you right now?

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,550
Yes, all right. There is a spare room.

50
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,850
But who will I live with?

51
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,430
- With Yoon Sang Yi. 
 - With me?

52
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,290
Sang Yi is my assistant.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,250
From now on, until you debut, he will be the youngest producer that will live with you.

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,560
I'm Kang In Soo. Let's get along.

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm Yoon Sang Yi.

56
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,780
Yes, Deputy?

57
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,200
Just a second.

58
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,720
Ah, I died.

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,600
Sit down.

60
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,750
What's the matter?

61
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,960
Just because... I wanted to see you?

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
Pardon?

63
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,410
Why are you so shocked. Of course, it was a joke!

64
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,020
Right.

65
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,930
I came to give you a mission. But now my mood isn't good.

66
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,490
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,630
It's fine. Do you move in together tomorrow?

68
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,220
Yes.

69
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,610
You like it, right?

70
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,110
What do you mean...

71
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,220
Because a Kang In Soo fan gets to live with Kang In soo, I'm asking if you like it.

72
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,260
But you said you had a mission for me.

73
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,770
I want you to surveil Kang In Soo 24/7.

74
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,150
Whether it's a lover or something that the company can't catch, I'm asking you to catch it.

75
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,020
Why? You don't want to?

76
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,410
Surveilling anyone isâ€”

77
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,720
You have to make Kang In Soo debut.

78
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,660
And you have to do it well.

79
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,600
Because of you, we found an unpolished gem, but get a hold of yourself.

80
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,890
There's still a lot of things to do.

81
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,580
Sang Yi, keep in mind what I'm about to say to you.

82
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,870
We're people who are finding artists to raise them, but ultimately, we're the ones making products to sell in the markets.

83
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,310
We're not different from the war warriors.

84
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,310
If we see anything that might diminish its value as a product, we have to get rid of it in advance.

85
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,660
Are you afraid of it?

86
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,340
Whatever it is, the thing that's going to come is real.

87
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,070
Here, the company credit card.

88
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,620
From now on, use this card. And keep this in your mind.

89
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,580
If you take this card, it means the war is started.

90
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,780
The real face of Kang In Soo, aren't you curious about it as well?
