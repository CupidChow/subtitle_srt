00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,020
No. This part right now.

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,940
â™«  Today's weather is nice, as well  â™«

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,130
â™«  Take light steps with my feelings in it  â™«

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,110
â™«  At this moment, right now  â™«

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,930
â™«  A sweet melody is ringing  â™«

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,110
â™«  It's strange. When I'm with you, 
 I feel like something good will happen  â™«

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,280
â™«  I feel renewed every time I look at you. What about you?  â™«

15

â™«  Let's go far away. Just stay two of us, all day  â™«

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,930
â™« This feeling that everything will be perfect â™«

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,470
Hurry and open your mouth. I'll feed you.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,920
This is a really good restaurant. Is it good?

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,640
It's crazy, it's crazy.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,180
Why are you so surprised after you were fed by him?

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,410
You're here? I called him because I'm in a good mood.

22
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,900
What? You already started without me?

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,080
I heard you got fired. So I was going to take you under my wing again, but you guys are having the time of your lives.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,130
I'll pour it for you.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,140
Because we're all the same age, we can speak informally. Right?

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,530
Because you're close, he's making me feel more comfortable.

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,500
Anyway, let's celebrate us all getting together.

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,570
For Kang In Soo's successful debut.

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,640
For Kang In Soo's successful debut!

30
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

31
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,370
- Hey, Sang Yi. 
 - I'm Min Sung.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,910
- Min Sung. 
 - What?

33
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,700
My mood is the best today.

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,270
Watch out for the car!

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,620
Sang Yi is a good musician, too.

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,060
- Min Sung. 
 - What?

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,740
- We should have another drink. 
 - Ah, stop it.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,640
Sang Yi you should have another drink, too.

39
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,600
Hey! This is hard. Grab him.

40
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,070
Hey! Lay him down here.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,040
Why did he drink so much?

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,850
Actually, something happened with In Soo today.

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,880
You know what?

44
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,100
I've known In Soo for a long time... Anyway,

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,460
I've never seen him this drunk before.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,050
But seeing him like this, for some reason, I'm relieved.

47
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,790
And I feel better because it's you, Sang Yi.

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,380
I heard about them picking up In Soo. If it was you instead of that female agent...

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,120
I think, he would have been really happy. Having his true worth recognized.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,450
Because I pity him, I always nagged him because I felt he was not reaching his potential.

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,940
In Soo is pitiful? What do you mean by that?

52
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,370
I don't know the details either. But In Soo's parents

53
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,060
seem to be important people. They dislike that he's a singer.

54
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,440
So I think they're interfering. But because he's always joking around and is a happy guy,

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,920
also, because he doesn't show his feeling that much, I just assume what's going on as well.

56
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,510
I'll get going.

57
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:48,250
â™« When you didn't know me, I was praying â™«

58
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,330
â™«  May your eyes always reach me  â™«

59
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:03,000
â™«  As much as I try to get close to you, the farther away you go  â™«

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,390
â™«  You wouldn't know how I feel  â™«

61
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:18,290
â™«  You know about it, but I wonder why you're like that. 
 Maybe you're not used to it  â™«

62
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:25,350
â™«  I like everything about you  â™«

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,800
â™«  I want to be the one who can see you when I want 
 and can be with you when you need me  â™«

64
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,900
â™«  I want to be that precious person to you  â™«

65
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,670
â™«  You're perfect as you are   â™«

66
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,970
â™«  Open your heart a little more and come closer to me  â™«

67
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:14,400
â™«  I want you to come closer to me  â™«

68
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,090
Why would you want to leave your house and come here?

69
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,230
I was curious. I wanted to come once.

70
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,480
Anyway, you're a weirdo.

71
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,350
What about you?

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,030
You are a weirdo as well!

73
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,470
This is different than what I thought.

74
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,180
It's humble, but it has everything I need.

75
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,610
No, because it's cozy.

76
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,250
For some reason, just looking at you, I thought it would be a lot bleaker.

77
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,120
With nothing but a mattress on the bed.

78
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,600
What do you think I am?

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,770
Am I homeless?

80
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,720
I wanted to come here once. The space you live in.

81
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,130
Why?

82
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,870
I'm not sure.

83
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,500
Just because.

84
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,670
Let's go out. There's a place I want to show you.

85
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,430
â™« If it all comes crashing down, we'll be just fine â™«

86
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,990
â™« When the day and night collide, we'll stand and fight â™«

87
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,500
The scenery is fantastic.

88
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,560
It's nice, right?

89
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,130
It's where I used to work part-time.

90
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,090
Sometimes I would come up here for a drink.

91
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,490
You don't need drinking and snacks.

92
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,310
I'm flattered.

93
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,780
That you wanted to show me a place like this.

94
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,030
What are you saying?

95
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,380
I can sleep here, right?

96
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,100
â™« When the storm is raging on, we... â™«

97
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,250
Yeah, as long as you're not uncomfortable.

98
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,470
You'll be more uncomfortable. Because of me.

99
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,960
What are you saying?

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
Why are you getting so close to me?

101
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,790
My mood is the best today.

102
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,210
I felt like I was walking in place,

103
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,490
with no end in sight.

104
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,140
â™« There's something about it, made us believe â™«

105
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,570
â™« that everyone's standing always in the ocean, and we are the only ones... â™«

106
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,410
The fact that it will be officially released,

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,240
why can't I believe it?

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,700
Actually, I don't know.

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm still nervous.

110
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,770
â™« Trying to get up the courage â™«

111
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,690
Is it going to end well?

112
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,440
â™« Trying to jump overboard â™«

113
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,750
What's wrong with you? You're self-confident Kang In Soo.

114
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Then, what about self-confident Yoon Sang Yi?

115
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,820
Are you scared?

116
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,550
Naturally! I'm scared!

117
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,050
On a day like this, shouldn't we invite Min Sung, too?

118
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,900
If if it's officially released,

119
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,170
then we'll do it then.

120
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,060
Today's only the two of us.

121
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,850
â™« If it all comes down to us, we'll be all right â™«

122
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,470
The two of us?

123
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,040
Cheers.

124
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,430
Yoon Sang Yi.

125
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,390
Because of you, I was really happy.

126
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,030
Don't say, "was happy," say, "be happy."

127
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,750
Let's be happy Kang In Soo. In the future, too.

128
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,710
â™« What we're afraid of is all that we're made of, and somewhere inside...  â™«

129
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,810
Let's be happy.

130
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,070
â™« Let's find it out for each other â™«

131
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,040
Thanks to you, I was able to move forward little by little.

132
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,000
â™« Let's reach inside deep down â™«

133
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,800
What are you saying? That's so cheesy.

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,730
â™« ... pull up all that the other â™«

135
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,550
Thank you, Yoon Sang Yi.
