1
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,600
It's his mother

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
who doesn't like me,

3
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,840
First,

4
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,840
people like you,

5
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
You can't afford to buy a house even if you work all your life.

6
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Second,

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
your

8
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,600
Brother Feng

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,080
is an irresponsible mama's boy,

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
His mother is so fierce.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,520
I won't let you be together.

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
So, Ming Xiao,

13
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,880
you'll end up with nothing.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,360
Mr. Huo,

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
you're the worst

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
I've ever seen,

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Bad guy!

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,760
I hate you.

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,160
Xiaoxiao,

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
what about yesterday,

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,360
I know everything.

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,960
Are you two

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,560
going to be together

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
for another week?

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
Just forgive him, okay?

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,520
It suddenly occurred to me,

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,000
you've been saving money recently, haven't you?

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,040
Come on,

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
This is

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
next week's salary,

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,960
I'll give it to you in advance.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Fine,

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
I won't be mad at him for now.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,640
I hope he can be a good boy for a week.

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920
Don't lose your temper.

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,880
Or I'll tell on you.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,600
Okay,

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,720
Come on

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
You're not angry so soon?

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,840
You're so greedy for money,

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,480
you're a money addict.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,760
I like money a lot

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
because it's cute,

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
I don't know how to talk nonsense.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,960
Meng,

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,880
can I go back and get my piggy bank

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,720
and live with you?

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,320
All my money is in it.

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
It's very important.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Of course.

51
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,640
Go now.

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,840
Boss,

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
if you want to live a good life

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,000
with company and food.

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,600
I suggest you keep quiet.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Gosh,

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,200
the thought of spending every day

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
with her,

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,160
I'd rather starve to death.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,320
Mr. Huo

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
really wants to die.

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,280
Well,

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,720
I'd better not go back now.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
If I go back,

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
what if Mr. Huo secretly wants to die

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,040
while I'm not here?

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,000
Me,

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,720
Stupid woman,

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
when Meng Guo leaves,

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
There are times when you suffer.

71
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
Ming Xiao, come out.

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
You've been sneaking around all the way.

73
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,520
Meng Guo didn't say,

74
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm not allowed to come to the beach.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
Mr. Huo,

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,840
you don't want to jump into the sea, do you?

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,360
Thank you.

78
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,960
Not yet.

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
That's good.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,240
I promised Meng,

81
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
I must take good care of you.

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't let anything happen to you.

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
The wind at the sea is too strong.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,480
You might catch a cold.

85
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,640
Let me push you back.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,560
Whatever.

87
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,760
Forget it.

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
I'll walk back by myself.

89
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
It's okay.

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,160
I have a lot of strength.

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
I'll be fine soon.

92
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Mingxiao,

93
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,120
thanks to you, do I really want to

94
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
jump into the sea now?

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm fine.

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
You can go back to your room.

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
Don't be angry.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
I didn't do it on purpose.

99
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
I.

100
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,080
Yes.

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,200
The performance of loving you.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,960
Ming Xiao,

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
what nonsense are you talking about?

104
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
What do you mean love or not?

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,840
Do you know what love is?

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Could it be

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
Did I say something wrong again?

108
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,640
Because I love you,

109
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
do I care about you?

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,440
Silly girl.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Do you know what love is?

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
Then tell me,

113
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
why do you love me?

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,280
You care about me,

115
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,240
because

116
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,720
You hurt your leg.

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Just like

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,960
The stray cats outside are just as pitiful.

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,240
So,

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,840
I will love you.

121
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,360
Besides,

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
Brother Meng also said,

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,240
You want me to care more about you.

124
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Then I can get

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
a lot of bonus.

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,880
That's enough.

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,680
You can leave.

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,640
Goodbye.

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,680
But,

130
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,000
you said

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
you were going to jump into the sea during the day?

132
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,560
But Mr. Huo will die

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,640
if he jumps into the sea.

134
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
That's why I have to look at you.

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,240
Mr. Huo,

136
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
why don't you say anything?

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,440
Are you dead?

138
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Your mother is just

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,520
a servant of our family.

140
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,480
Why are you competing with me for family property?

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Uncle,

142
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
please spare me

143
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,160
and my mom.

144
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
And you,

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
you shouldn't have

146
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,720
appeared in this world.

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
So you must die.

148
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
I want revenge.

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,360
I want the Huo family

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,920
to go to hell with me.

151
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
As for Lin's Group,

152
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
you have to keep an eye on it.

153
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,760
That Linxi is smarter than her father,

154
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,040
so he's not that easy to deal with.

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,760
Okay,

156
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,800
By the way,

157
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
I think you can

158
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
reduce your vacation a little bit.

159
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
If necessary,

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,480
you can bring

161
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
your nominal foster mother here,

162
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120
Medical expenses and travelling expenses

163
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,240
can be reimbursed by the company.

164
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,800
That's weird.

165
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Mr. Huo

166
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,520
has become so generous.

167
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,240
Looks like you're looking for Xiaoxiao as a special nurse.

168
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
It's a wise decision.

169
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,520
You've spent a lot of time with Xiaoxiao,

170
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,560
and you've become so human.

171
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,840
What does it have to do with her?

172
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,040
He hung up

173
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,760
for no reason.

174
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,320
Human touch?

175
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,720
How is that possible?

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,040
I'll keep her.

177
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Just because she's silly and funny,

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
can't I

179
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
make fun of myself?

180
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,400
Mr. Huo,

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
the room has been cleaned.

182
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,120
It's time

183
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,840
to clean the rooftop.

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Please move somewhere else.

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,920
This is my home.

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,760
I can be wherever I like.

187
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Why should I listen to you?

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
All right.

189
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,040
You lost your temper again.

190
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,840
I have to listen to you anyway.

191
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,600
I'll come

192
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
and clean it later.

193
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,240
Hold on.

194
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,720
Ming Xiaoxiao,

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,560
I suddenly want to eat ice cream.

196
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
I want a brand that is not available

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
in the most exclusive resort,

198
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,560
Since you listen to me,

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,840
go and buy one

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,400
for me.

201
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,280
But,

202
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,080
you don't like

203
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,280
ice cream, do you?

204
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,240
Besides,

205
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,680
I don't know

206
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,560
what the best ice cream is, right?

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,600
All right,

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
I'll call Meng Guo now

209
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,040
and tell him,

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
He said you didn't take good care of him.

211
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Not to mention the bonus,

212
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
the basic salary is gone,

213
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:05,920
For nothing?

214
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
All right,

215
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
I'll buy it for you.

216
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
Stupid Ming Xiaoxiao,

217
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,480
the whole resort

218
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,520
doesn't even have a canteen,

219
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
Not to mention ice cream.

220
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
I asked you to mind your own business.

221
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
You'll be the one to watch this time.

222
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Ming Xiaoxiao, you're so bold.

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
How dare you do it in the middle of the night.

224
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,800
Mr. Huo,

225
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,600
I've bought

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
the best ice cream.

227
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,400
Look.

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
It melted.

229
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,960
It's very well protected.

230
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo,

231
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I didn't steal it.

232
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,280
Maybe

233
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,040
I can buy you a new one.

234
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,200
This place is at least 30 kilometers away

235
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
from the resort.

236
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,680
You came all the way here,

237
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,360
just to buy me

238
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,080
an ice cream?

239
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,400
Of course,

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Mr. Huo

241
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,360
is sure to have

242
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,720
the best ice cream in the world,

243
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
It's not just ice cream.

244
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
What does

245
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Mr. Huo want in this world?

246
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,760
What do you want to do?

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,640
Xiaoxiao will

248
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
help you achieve it.

249
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,400
What a fool.

250
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Huo,

251
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm sorry,

252
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,320
I really didn't steal

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
the ice cream.

254
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,520
Fool Ming, Xiaoxiao,

255
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,080
you gave it to me today,

256
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,960
It's not just an ice cream.

257
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,040
It's something I've never had in all these years.

258
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Unreserved trust and love.

259
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Thank you.

260
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,120
Does it hurt?

261
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

262
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,120
Okay,

263
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,680
it hurts a little bit.

264
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
Why are you so stupid?

265
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
You can just buy

266
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
any brand of ice cream, right?

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,680
You fell, didn't you?

268
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,960
You deserve it.

269
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,920
But,

270
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
you said you wanted

271
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
the best ice cream.

272
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I must buy it for you.

273
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,320
How can you just buy it?

274
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,400
Ming Xiaoxiao,

275
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,880
you're just a part-time worker,

276
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
You don't have to be so nice to me.

277
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,120
If you give me the money,

278
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I'll work hard.

279
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,880
Besides,

280
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,880
with money,

281
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,160
That's why I can buy a house.

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,560
Which house do you want?

283
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,400
Say it out,

284
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,400
and I'll give you

285
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,680
a house,

286
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,440
You're weird.

287
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,320
Why did you give someone else a house?

288
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,200
I don't want it.

289
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,200
Ming Xiaoxiao,

290
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,400
think it over.

291
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,080
After tonight,

292
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,080
it will be gone.

293
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
You're sweating and blowing the wind.

294
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,160
You just stay here.

295
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll cook ginger soup for you.

296
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,160
In case you catch a cold.

297
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,840
Mr. Huo,

298
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
you're giving me a house again?

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
If you want to cook ginger soup for me again,

300
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,000
why are you so nice to me

301
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,720
all of a sudden?

302
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,520
That's right.

303
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,880
What's wrong with me?

304
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
I can't believe you're so nice to a fool.

305
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,320
You.

306
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,760
Make the soup

307
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,680
by yourself. I'm going to bed.

308
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Mr. Huo,

309
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
there's really something wrong with him.

310
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,320
Sometimes it's cold,

311
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,120
sometimes it's hot,

312
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,080
You'll have ice cream later,

313
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,360
ginger soup later,

314
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,680
It seems that

315
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
he's really out of his mind.

316
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,320
Huo Yun Ting,

317
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,840
don't lose your mind again.

318
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,120
Wake up.

319
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,200
The Book of Answers,

320
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
can you give me an answer?

321
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
Is there something wrong with me?

322
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Terrifying.

323
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,000
Do I kind of

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,120
like that little fool,

325
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Love her.

326
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,640
Should I kick her out?

327
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,520
Are you kidding me?

328
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,760
Childish.

329
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
That's impossible.

330
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't want boiled eggs tomorrow morning,

331
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
I want fried eggs.

332
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,600
Medium rare.

333
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Reply quickly.

334
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
Mr. Huo,

335
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,760
you didn't sleep?

336
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,840
Why didn't you text me back

337
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
or answer my calls,

338
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
You're such

339
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
a bad guy!

340
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,080
But sometimes.

341
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,320
You're fast asleep.

342
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,840
It's cute.

343
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,080
Silly girl.

344
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
As I said yesterday,

345
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
I only eat fried eggs.

346
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,160
Yesterday,

347
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
you didn't say that,

348
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,800
I sent you a message last night

349
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,760
to remind you.

350
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,480
Why didn't you

351
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,040
text me back?

352
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,000
My WeChat broke down yesterday,

353
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,040
but,

354
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,560
Other news,

355
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,520
I haven't received it either.

356
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,840
Is there really no such thing?

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,680
Sorry,

358
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,520
the number you dialed,

359
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,640
Ming Xiao,

360
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,160
your phone is in arrears,

361
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,320
We had a deal.

362
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
You want to be online 24 hours a day?

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm on call.

364
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
It's my fault.

366
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
I'll recharge it next month.

367
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,920
We don't have enough money.

368
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
If anything happens to you,

369
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,520
You just

370
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,880
Call me louder,

371
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,600
okay?

372
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,760
How come you don't have money?

373
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,320
Where's the salary Meng Guo gave you in advance,

374
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,640
Fenfen said,

375
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,120
Her boyfriend is sick

376
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,600
and needs money,

377
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
So I lent it to her.

378
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,440
You really are.

379
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,040
I'm not stupid.

380
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,400
Don't be mean to me.

381
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,480
Fenfen's boyfriend

382
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,640
was short of money last time,

383
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
I didn't even help.

384
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,960
He's sick this time,

385
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,560
do I have to help him?

386
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Mr. Huo

387
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
is sick,

388
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
It's hard.

389
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,960
You're sick,

390
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,640
I'll help you, too.

391
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,320
Don't be mad at her.

392
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,520
Okay?

393
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,360
Forget it.

394
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,440
It's done.

395
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,480
See for yourself.

396
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,240
You're wasting your money.

397
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,800
Stupid,

398
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,480
Ming Xiao,

399
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,280
do you understand it or not?

400
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,360
Thank others for their kindness.

401
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,120
Forget it.

402
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,960
I know you don't understand,

403
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Let's talk less in the future.

404
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,240
Keep your distance.

405
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,400
Ming Xiaoxiao,

406
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
it's been five minutes.

407
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,440
When are you going to

408
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,360
push me to the beach.

409
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm coming.

410
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,680
What do you mean?

411
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,640
Do I have a virus?

412
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,880
I asked you to push a wheelchair.

413
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,560
You're like this,

414
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,240
Yes.

415
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
Did you say that?

416
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,520
Stop talking

417
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,720
and keep your distance.

418
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,040
You're

419
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,880
quite smart now,

420
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,160
Yes,

421
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,280
I did,

422
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
Stay away from me.

423
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,360
Go, go, go,

424
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,160
go. Why are you angry again?

425
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,320
Mr. Huo,

426
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,520
You,

427
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,440
You're so weird.

428
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,120
You're so nice

429
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,280
to people later,

430
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,960
Later, he was very bad

431
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,320
to people.

432
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,200
I don't understand.

433
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,560
That's who I am.

434
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
You can't stand to leave.

435
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,400
You hypocrites, it's good

436
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,360
that you all left.

437
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Okay,

438
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,400
Are you out of breath?

439
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,600
No.

440
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,640
Mr. Huo,

441
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,320
we

442
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,320
Don't keep your distance.

443
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,880
Sit back.

444
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,240
Don't hurt your leg again.

445
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
Why are your feet so cold?

446
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,120
I said no,

447
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,960
let's go out and get some fresh air.

448
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,560
Xiaoxiao,

449
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,120
what about yesterday,

450
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,760
I know everything.

451
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,360
Are you two

452
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,960
going to be together

453
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
for another week?

454
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,280
Just forgive him, okay?

455
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,920
It suddenly occurred to me,

456
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
you've been saving money recently, haven't you?

457
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,440
Come on,

458
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,680
This is

459
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,360
next week's salary,

460
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,360
I'll give it to you in advance.

461
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Fine,

462
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,080
I won't be mad at him for now.

463
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,040
I hope he can be a good boy for a week.

464
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,320
Don't lose your temper.

465
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,280
Or I'll tell on you.

466
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay,

467
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,120
Come on

468
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,280
You're not angry so soon?

469
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,240
You're so greedy for money,

470
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,880
you're a money addict.

471
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,160
I like money a lot

472
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
because it's cute,

473
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,280
I don't know how to talk nonsense.

474
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,360
Meng,

475
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,280
can I go back and get my piggy bank

476
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,120
and live with you?

477
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,720
All my money is in it.

478
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,960
It's very important.

479
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,440
Of course.

480
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,040
Go now.

481
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,240
Boss,

482
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
if you want to live a good life

483
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,400
with company and food.

484
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,000
I suggest you keep quiet.

485
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,880
Gosh,

486
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,600
the thought of spending every day

487
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
with her,

488
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,560
I'd rather starve to death.

489
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,720
Mr. Huo

490
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,040
really wants to die.

491
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,680
Well,

492
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,120
I'd better not go back now.

493
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
If I go back,

494
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
what if Mr. Huo secretly wants to die

495
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,440
while I'm not here?

496
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,400
Me,

497
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,120
Stupid woman,

498
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
when Meng Guo leaves,

499
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
There are times when you suffer.

500
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
Ming Xiao, come out.

501
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
You've been sneaking around all the way.

502
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,920
Meng Guo didn't say,

503
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm not allowed to come to the beach.

504
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,440
Mr. Huo,

505
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,240
you don't want to jump into the sea, do you?

506
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,760
Thank you.

507
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Not yet.

508
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
That's good.

509
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,640
I promised Meng,

510
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,840
I must take good care of you.

511
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,080
Don't let anything happen to you.

512
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,600
The wind at the sea is too strong.

513
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,880
You might catch a cold.

514
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,040
Let me push you back.

515
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,960
Whatever.

516
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Forget it.

517
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
I'll walk back by myself.

518
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,320
It's okay.

519
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,560
I have a lot of strength.

520
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,440
I'll be fine soon.

521
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,800
Mingxiao,

522
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,520
thanks to you, do I really want to

523
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,400
jump into the sea now?

524
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,760
I'm fine.

525
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,640
You can go back to your room.

526
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,160
Don't be angry.

527
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,840
I didn't do it on purpose.

528
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,800
I.

529
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,480
Yes.

530
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,600
The performance of loving you.

531
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,360
Ming Xiao,

532
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
what nonsense are you talking about?

533
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,320
What do you mean love or not?

534
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Do you know what love is?

535
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,160
Could it be

536
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,640
Did I say something wrong again?

537
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,040
Because I love you,

538
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,040
do I care about you?

539
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,840
Silly girl.

540
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,080
Do you know what love is?

541
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,120
Then tell me,

542
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
why do you love me?

543
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,680
You care about me,

544
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,640
because

545
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,120
You hurt your leg.

546
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,400
Just like

547
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,360
The stray cats outside are just as pitiful.

548
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
So,

549
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,240
I will love you.

550
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,760
Besides,

551
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
Brother Meng also said,

552
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,640
You want me to care more about you.

553
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Then I can get

554
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,000
a lot of bonus.

555
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,280
That's enough.

556
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,080
You can leave.

557
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,040
Goodbye.

558
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,080
But,

559
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
you said

560
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,200
you were going to jump into the sea during the day?

561
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,960
But Mr. Huo will die

562
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,040
if he jumps into the sea.

563
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,600
That's why I have to look at you.

564
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Mr. Huo,

565
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,280
why don't you say anything?

566
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,840
Are you dead?

567
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,120
Your mother is just

568
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,920
a servant of our family.

569
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,880
Why are you competing with me for family property?

570
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,400
Uncle,

571
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
please spare me

572
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
and my mom.

573
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,800
And you,

574
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
you shouldn't have

575
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,120
appeared in this world.

576
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
So you must die.

577
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,240
I want revenge.

578
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,760
I want the Huo family

579
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,320
to go to hell with me.

580
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
As for Lin's Group,

581
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,560
you have to keep an eye on it.

582
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
That Linxi is smarter than her father,

583
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,440
so he's not that easy to deal with.

584
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,160
Okay,

585
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,200
By the way,

586
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,720
I think you can

587
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
reduce your vacation a little bit.

588
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,760
If necessary,

589
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,880
you can bring

590
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
your nominal foster mother here,

591
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,520
Medical expenses and travelling expenses

592
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,640
can be reimbursed by the company.

593
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,200
That's weird.

594
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Mr. Huo

595
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,920
has become so generous.

596
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,640
Looks like you're looking for Xiaoxiao as a special nurse.

597
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,760
It's a wise decision.

598
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,920
You've spent a lot of time with Xiaoxiao,

599
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,960
and you've become so human.

600
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,240
What does it have to do with her?

601
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,440
He hung up

602
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,160
for no reason.

603
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,720
Human touch?

604
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,120
How is that possible?

605
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,440
I'll keep her.

606
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,200
Just because she's silly and funny,

607
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,520
can't I

608
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,480
make fun of myself?

609
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,800
Mr. Huo,

610
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
the room has been cleaned.

611
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,520
It's time

612
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,240
to clean the rooftop.

613
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,600
Please move somewhere else.

614
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,320
This is my home.

615
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
I can be wherever I like.

616
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,160
Why should I listen to you?

617
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
All right.

618
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,440
You lost your temper again.

619
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,240
I have to listen to you anyway.

620
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll come

621
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,520
and clean it later.

622
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,640
Hold on.

623
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,120
Ming Xiaoxiao,

624
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,960
I suddenly want to eat ice cream.

625
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,280
I want a brand that is not available

626
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,080
in the most exclusive resort,

627
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,960
Since you listen to me,

628
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,240
go and buy one

629
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,800
for me.

630
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,680
But,

631
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,480
you don't like

632
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,680
ice cream, do you?

633
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,640
Besides,

634
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,080
I don't know

635
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,960
what the best ice cream is, right?

636
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,000
All right,

637
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,680
I'll call Meng Guo now

638
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,440
and tell him,

639
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
He said you didn't take good care of him.

640
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,200
Not to mention the bonus,

641
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
the basic salary is gone,

642
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,320
For nothing?

643
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,760
All right,

644
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,720
I'll buy it for you.

645
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,480
Stupid Ming Xiaoxiao,

646
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,880
the whole resort

647
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,920
doesn't even have a canteen,

648
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,880
Not to mention ice cream.

649
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,560
I asked you to mind your own business.

650
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,960
You'll be the one to watch this time.

651
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,680
Ming Xiaoxiao, you're so bold.

652
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,880
How dare you do it in the middle of the night.

653
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,200
Mr. Huo,

654
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,000
I've bought

655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the best ice cream.

656
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,800
Look.

657
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,640
It melted.

658
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,360
It's very well protected.

659
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo,

660
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
I didn't steal it.

661
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,680
Maybe

662
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,440
I can buy you a new one.

663
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,600
This place is at least 30 kilometers away

664
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,640
from the resort.

665
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,080
You came all the way here,

666
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,760
just to buy me

667
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,480
an ice cream?

668
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,800
Of course,

669
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Mr. Huo

670
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,760
is sure to have

671
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,120
the best ice cream in the world,

672
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,880
It's not just ice cream.

673
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
What does

674
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:16,840
Mr. Huo want in this world?

675
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,160
What do you want to do?

676
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,040
Xiaoxiao will

677
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,320
help you achieve it.

678
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,800
What a fool.

679
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,400
Mr. Huo,

680
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm sorry,

681
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,720
I really didn't steal

682
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,080
the ice cream.

683
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,280
Fool Ming Xiaoxiao,

684
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,440
you stole it,

685
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,560
It's not just an ice cream.

686
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,520
Does it hurt?

687
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,360
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

688
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,520
Okay,

689
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,080
it hurts a little bit.

690
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,800
Why are you so stupid?

691
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,560
You can just buy

692
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,760
any brand of ice cream, right?

693
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,080
You fell, didn't you?

694
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,360
You deserve it.

695
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,320
But,

696
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,640
you said you wanted

697
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
the best ice cream.

698
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
I must buy it for you.

699
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,720
How can you just buy it?

700
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,800
Ming Xiaoxiao,

701
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,280
you're just a part-time worker,

702
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
You don't have to be so nice to me.

703
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,520
If you give me the money,

704
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
I'll work hard.

705
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,280
Besides,

706
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,280
with money,

707
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,560
That's why I can buy a house.

708
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,960
Which house do you want?

709
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,800
Say it out,

710
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,800
and I'll give you

711
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,080
a house,

712
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,840
You're weird.

713
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,720
Why did you give someone else a house?

714
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,600
I don't want it.

715
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,600
Ming Xiaoxiao,

716
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,800
think it over.

717
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,480
After tonight,

718
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,480
it will be gone.

719
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,640
You're sweating and blowing the wind.

720
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,560
You just stay here.

721
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,800
I'll cook ginger soup for you.

722
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,560
In case you catch a cold.

723
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,240
Mr. Huo,

724
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,280
you're giving me a house again?

725
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,880
If you want to cook ginger soup for me again,

726
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,400
why are you so nice to me

727
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,120
all of a sudden?

728
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:58,920
That's right.

729
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,280
What's wrong with me?

730
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,440
I can't believe you're so nice to a fool.

731
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,720
You.

732
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,160
Make the soup

733
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,080
by yourself. I'm going to bed.

734
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,160
Mr. Huo,

735
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,280
there's really something wrong with him.

736
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,720
Sometimes it's cold,

737
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,520
sometimes it's hot,

738
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,480
You'll have ice cream later,

739
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,760
ginger soup later,

740
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,080
It seems that

741
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
he's really out of his mind.

742
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,720
Huo Yun Ting,

743
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,240
don't lose your mind again.

744
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,520
Wake up.

745
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,600
The Book of Answers,

746
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,640
can you give me an answer?

747
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,760
Is there something wrong with me?

748
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Terrifying.

749
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,400
Do I kind of

750
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,520
like that little fool,

751
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,560
Love her.

752
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,040
Should I kick her out?

753
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,920
Are you kidding me?

754
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,160
Childish.

755
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:43,800
That's impossible.

756
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,600
I don't want boiled eggs tomorrow morning,

757
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,640
I want fried eggs.

758
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,000
Medium rare.

759
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
Reply quickly.

760
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,120
Mr. Huo,

761
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,160
you didn't sleep?

762
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,240
Why didn't you text me back

763
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,400
or answer my calls,

764
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
You're such

765
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
a bad guy!

766
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,480
But sometimes.

767
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,720
You're fast asleep.

768
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,240
It's cute.

769
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,480
Silly girl.

770
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,840
As I said yesterday,

771
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,080
I only eat fried eggs.

772
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,560
Yesterday,

773
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
you didn't say that,

774
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,200
I sent you a message last night

775
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,160
to remind you.

776
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,880
Why didn't you

777
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,440
text me back?

778
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,400
My WeChat broke down yesterday,

779
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,440
but,

780
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,960
Other news,

781
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,920
I haven't received it either.

782
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,240
Is there really no such thing?

783
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,080
Sorry,

784
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,920
the number you dialed,

785
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,040
Ming Xiao,

786
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,560
your phone is in arrears,

787
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,720
We had a deal.

788
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,400
You want to be online 24 hours a day?

789
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,240
I'm on call.

790
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,800
I'm sorry.

791
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,320
It's my fault.

792
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,640
I'll recharge it next month.

793
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,320
We don't have enough money.

794
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,280
If anything happens to you,

795
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:57,920
You just

796
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,280
Call me louder,

797
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,000
okay?

798
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,160
How come you don't have money?

799
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,720
Where's the salary Meng Guo gave you in advance,

800
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,040
Fenfen said,

801
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,520
Her boyfriend is sick

802
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,000
and needs money,

803
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,520
So I lent it to her.

804
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,840
You really are.

805
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,440
I'm not stupid.

806
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,800
Don't be mean to me.

807
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,880
Fenfen's boyfriend

808
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,040
was short of money last time,

809
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,320
I didn't even help.

810
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,360
He's sick this time,

811
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,960
do I have to help him?

812
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,920
Mr. Huo

813
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,400
is sick,

814
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,120
It's hard.

815
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,360
You're sick,

816
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,040
I'll help you, too.

817
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,720
Don't be mad at her.

818
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,920
Okay?

819
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,760
Forget it.

820
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,840
It's done.

821
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,880
See for yourself.

822
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,640
You're wasting your money.

823
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,200
Stupid,

824
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,880
Ming Xiao,

825
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,680
do you understand it or not?

826
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,760
Thank others for their kindness.

827
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,520
Forget it.

828
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,360
I know you don't understand,

829
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,040
Let's talk less in the future.

830
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,640
Keep your distance.

831
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,800
Ming Xiaoxiao,

832
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,440
it's been five minutes.

833
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,840
When are you going to

834
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,760
push me to the beach.

835
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,240
I'm coming.

836
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,080
What do you mean?

837
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,040
Do I have a virus?

838
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,280
I asked you to push a wheelchair.

839
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,960
You're like this,

840
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,640
Yes.

841
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,120
Did you say that?

842
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,920
Stop talking

843
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,120
and keep your distance.

844
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,440
You're

845
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,280
quite smart now,

846
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,560
Yes,

847
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,680
I did,

848
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,920
Stay away from me.

849
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,760
Go, go, go,

850
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,560
go. Why are you angry again?

851
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:45,720
Mr. Huo,

852
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:46,920
You,

853
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,840
You're so strange.

854
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:36,560
Boss,

855
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,280
your illness will only

856
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,920
get worse.

857
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,960
Why don't you understand?

858
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:39,920
Special Assistant Meng,

859
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,640
you've worked so hard.

860
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,640
I have to take care of

861
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,920
those half-dead people everywhere,

862
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,720
If a child disobeys,

863
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
he'll probably be used to it.

864
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,280
Just give it a beating.

865
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,600
Lin's Group still has value,

866
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,720
I'll be Mrs. Huo.

867
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,480
Its absolute controlling right,

868
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,560
is the dowry,

869
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Huo Yun Ting,

870
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,760
you need me.

871
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,880
Xiaoxiao,

872
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,200
I'm already an adult.

873
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:58,920
From now on,

874
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,360
I have to earn a lot of money.

875
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,600
You'll start a family of your own.

876
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,360
Anyway,

877
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,000
I just want to be with you.

878
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:25,920
Xiaoxiao,

879
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,480
what about yesterday,

880
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,120
I know everything.

881
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,720
Are you two

882
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,320
going to be together

883
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
for another week?

884
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,640
Just forgive him, okay?

885
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,280
It suddenly occurred to me,

886
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,760
you've been saving money recently, haven't you?

887
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:37,800
Come on,

888
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,040
This is

889
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,720
next week's salary,

890
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,720
I'll give it to you in advance.

891
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,360
Fine,

892
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,440
I won't be mad at him for now.

893
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,400
I hope he can be a good boy for a week.

894
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,680
Don't lose your temper.

895
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,640
Or I'll tell on you.

896
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,360
Okay,

897
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,480
Come on

898
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,640
You're not angry so soon?

899
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,600
You're so greedy for money,

900
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,240
you're a money addict.

901
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,520
I like money a lot

902
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,320
because it's cute,

903
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,640
I don't know how to talk nonsense.

904
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,720
Meng,

905
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,640
can I go back and get my piggy bank

906
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,480
and live with you?

907
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,080
All my money is in it.

908
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,320
It's very important.

909
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:18,800
Of course.

910
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:19,400
Go now.

911
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,600
Boss,

912
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,360
if you want to live a good life

913
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,760
with company and food.

914
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,360
I suggest you keep quiet.

915
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,240
Gosh,

916
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,960
the thought of spending every day

917
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,960
with her,

918
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,920
I'd rather starve to death.

919
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,080
Mr. Huo

920
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,400
really wants to die.

921
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,040
Well,

922
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,480
I'd better not go back now.

923
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
If I go back,

924
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
what if Mr. Huo secretly wants to die

925
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,800
while I'm not here?

926
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:53,760
Me,

927
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,480
Stupid woman,

928
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
when Meng Guo leaves,

929
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
There are times when you suffer.

930
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,560
Ming Xiao, come out.

931
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,120
You've been sneaking around all the way.

932
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,280
Meng Guo didn't say,

933
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,200
I'm not allowed to come to the beach.

934
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,800
Mr. Huo,

935
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,600
you don't want to jump into the sea, do you?

936
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,120
Thank you.

937
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,720
Not yet.

938
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,480
That's good.

939
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,000
I promised Meng,

940
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,200
I must take good care of you.

941
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,440
Don't let anything happen to you.

942
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,960
The wind at the sea is too strong.

943
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,240
You might catch a cold.

944
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,400
Let me push you back.

945
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,320
Whatever.

946
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,520
Forget it.

947
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
I'll walk back by myself.

948
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,680
It's okay.

949
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,920
I have a lot of strength.

950
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,800
I'll be fine soon.

951
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,160
Mingxiao,

952
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,880
thanks to you, do I really want to

953
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,760
jump into the sea now?

954
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,120
I'm fine.

955
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,000
You can go back to your room.

956
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,520
Don't be angry.

957
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,200
I didn't do it on purpose.

958
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,160
I.

959
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:18,840
Yes.

960
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,960
The performance of loving you.

961
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,720
Ming Xiao,

962
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
what nonsense are you talking about?

963
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,680
What do you mean love or not?

964
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,600
Do you know what love is?

965
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,520
Could it be

966
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,000
Did I say something wrong again?

967
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,400
Because I love you,

968
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,400
do I care about you?

969
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,200
Silly girl.

970
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,440
Do you know what love is?

971
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,480
Then tell me,

972
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,880
why do you love me?

973
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,040
You care about me,

974
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,000
because

975
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,480
You hurt your leg.

976
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,760
Just like

977
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,720
The stray cats outside are just as pitiful.

978
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,000
So,

979
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,600
I will love you.

980
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,120
Besides,

981
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,600
Brother Meng also said,

982
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,000
You want me to care more about you.

983
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,320
Then I can get

984
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,360
a lot of bonus.

985
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:09,640
That's enough.

986
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,440
You can leave.

987
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,400
Goodbye.

988
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,440
But,

989
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,760
you said

990
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,560
you were going to jump into the sea during the day?

991
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,320
But Mr. Huo will die

992
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,400
if he jumps into the sea.

993
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,960
That's why I have to look at you.

994
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,000
Mr. Huo,

995
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,640
why don't you say anything?

996
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,200
Are you dead?

997
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,160
Ming Xiao,

998
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,480
what are you trying to do?

999
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,520
I just don't want you to die.

1000
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,000
because

1001
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,040
When my mother died,

1002
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,560
it was gone.

1003
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,640
So,

1004
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,600
Mr. Huo,

1005
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,480
Don't die.

1006
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,320
Ming Xiaoxiao,

1007
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,640
I really don't know

1008
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
if you really said these words,

1009
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,760
Someone wrote

1010
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,440
the script for you,

1011
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,760
Anyway,

1012
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,320
you won the bet this time,

1013
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,400
Your mother is just

1014
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,200
a servant of our family.

1015
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,160
Why are you competing with me for family property?

1016
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,680
Uncle,

1017
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,880
please spare me

1018
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,840
and my mom.

1019
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,080
And you,

1020
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,920
you shouldn't have

1021
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,400
appeared in this world.

1022
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
So you must die.

1023
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,520
I want revenge.

1024
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,040
I want the Huo family

1025
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,600
to go to hell with me.

1026
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
As for Lin's Group,

1027
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:08,840
you have to keep an eye on it.

1028
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,440
That Linxi is smarter than her father,

1029
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,720
so he's not that easy to deal with.

1030
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:13,440
Okay,

1031
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:14,480
By the way,

1032
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,000
I think you can

1033
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
reduce your vacation a little bit.

1034
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,040
If necessary,

1035
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,160
you can bring

1036
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
your nominal foster mother here,

1037
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,800
Medical expenses and travelling expenses

1038
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,920
can be reimbursed by the company.

1039
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,480
That's weird.

1040
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
Mr. Huo

1041
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,200
has become so generous.

1042
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,920
Looks like you're looking for Xiaoxiao as a special nurse.

1043
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,040
It's a wise decision.

1044
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,200
You've spent a lot of time with Xiaoxiao,

1045
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,240
and you've become so human.

1046
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,520
What does it have to do with her?

1047
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,720
He hung up

1048
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,440
for no reason.

1049
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,000
Human touch?

1050
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,400
How is that possible?

1051
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,720
I'll keep her.

1052
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,480
Just because she's silly and funny,

1053
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,800
can't I

1054
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,760
make fun of myself?

1055
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,080
Mr. Huo,

1056
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,480
the room has been cleaned.

1057
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,800
It's time

1058
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,520
to clean the rooftop.

1059
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,880
Please move somewhere else.

1060
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,600
This is my home.

1061
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,440
I can be wherever I like.

1062
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,440
Why should I listen to you?

1063
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,600
All right.

1064
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,720
You lost your temper again.

1065
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,520
I have to listen to you anyway.

1066
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,280
I'll come

1067
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,800
and clean it later.

1068
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:19,920
Hold on.

1069
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,400
Ming Xiaoxiao,

1070
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,240
I suddenly want to eat ice cream.

1071
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,560
I want a brand that is not available

1072
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,360
in the most exclusive resort,

1073
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,240
Since you listen to me,

1074
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,520
go and buy one

1075
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,080
for me.

1076
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:31,960
But,

1077
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,760
you don't like

1078
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,960
ice cream, do you?

1079
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:34,920
Besides,

1080
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,360
I don't know

1081
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,240
what the best ice cream is, right?

1082
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,280
All right,

1083
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,960
I'll call Meng Guo now

1084
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,720
and tell him,

1085
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
He said you didn't take good care of him.

1086
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,480
Not to mention the bonus,

1087
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
the basic salary is gone,

1088
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:47,600
For nothing?

1089
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,040
All right,

1090
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,000
I'll buy it for you.

1091
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,760
Stupid Ming Xiaoxiao,

1092
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,160
the whole resort

1093
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,200
doesn't even have a canteen,

1094
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,160
Not to mention ice cream.

1095
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,840
I asked you to mind your own business.

1096
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,240
You'll be the one to watch this time.

1097
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,040
Ming Xiaoxiao, you're so bold.

1098
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,240
How dare you do it in the middle of the night.

1099
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,560
Mr. Huo,

1100
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,360
I've bought

1101
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
the best ice cream.

1102
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,160
Look.

1103
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,000
It melted.

1104
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,720
It's very well protected.

1105
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,120
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo,

1106
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,680
I didn't steal it.

1107
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,040
Maybe

1108
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,800
I can buy you a new one.

1109
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,960
This place is at least 30 kilometers away

1110
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,000
from the resort.

1111
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,440
You came all the way here,

1112
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,120
just to buy me

1113
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,840
an ice cream?

1114
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,160
Of course,

1115
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,960
Mr. Huo

1116
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,120
is sure to have

1117
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,480
the best ice cream in the world,

1118
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,240
It's not just ice cream.

1119
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,920
What does

1120
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,200
Mr. Huo want in this world?

1121
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,520
What do you want to do?

1122
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,400
Xiaoxiao will

1123
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,680
help you achieve it.

1124
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,160
What a fool.

1125
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,760
Mr. Huo,

1126
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,560
I'm sorry,

1127
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,080
I really didn't steal

1128
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,440
the ice cream.

1129
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,640
Fool Ming Xiaoxiao,

1130
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,800
you stole it,

1131
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,920
It's not just an ice cream.

1132
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:36,880
Does it hurt?

1133
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,720
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

1134
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,880
Okay,

1135
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,440
it hurts a little bit.

1136
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,160
Why are you so stupid?

1137
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,920
You can just buy

1138
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,120
any brand of ice cream, right?

1139
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,440
You fell, didn't you?

1140
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,720
You deserve it.

1141
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:54,680
But,

1142
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,000
you said you wanted

1143
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,360
the best ice cream.

1144
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
I must buy it for you.

1145
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,080
How can you just buy it?

1146
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,160
Ming Xiaoxiao,

1147
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,640
you're just a part-time worker,

1148
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,160
You don't have to be so nice to me.

1149
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:06,880
If you give me the money,

1150
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,880
I'll work hard.

1151
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:08,640
Besides,

1152
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,640
with money,

1153
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,920
That's why I can buy a house.

1154
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,320
Which house do you want?

1155
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,160
Say it out,

1156
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,160
and I'll give you

1157
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,440
a house,

1158
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,200
You're weird.

1159
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,080
Why did you give someone else a house?

1160
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:23,960
I don't want it.

1161
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:24,960
Ming Xiaoxiao,

1162
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,160
think it over.

1163
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,840
After tonight,

1164
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:28,840
it will be gone.

1165
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,000
You're sweating and blowing the wind.

1166
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:34,920
You just stay here.

1167
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,160
I'll cook ginger soup for you.

1168
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:36,920
In case you catch a cold.

1169
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,600
Mr. Huo,

1170
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,640
you're giving me a house again?

1171
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,240
If you want to cook ginger soup for me again,

1172
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:43,760
why are you so nice to me

1173
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,480
all of a sudden?

1174
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,280
That's right.

1175
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,640
What's wrong with me?

1176
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,800
I can't believe you're so nice to a fool.

1177
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,080
You.

1178
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,520
Make the soup

1179
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,440
by yourself. I'm going to bed.

1180
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,520
Mr. Huo,

1181
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,640
there's really something wrong with him.

1182
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,080
Sometimes it's cold,

1183
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:05,880
sometimes it's hot,

1184
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,840
You'll have ice cream later,

1185
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,120
ginger soup later,

1186
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,440
It seems that

1187
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,640
he's really out of his mind.

1188
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,080
Huo Yun Ting,

1189
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,600
don't lose your mind again.

1190
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:31,880
Wake up.

1191
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:36,960
The Book of Answers,

1192
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,000
can you give me an answer?

1193
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,120
Is there something wrong with me?

1194
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Terrifying.

1195
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:56,760
Do I kind of

1196
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,880
like that little fool,

1197
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,920
Love her.

1198
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,400
Should I kick her out?

1199
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,280
Are you kidding me?

1200
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,520
Childish.

1201
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,160
That's impossible.

1202
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,960
I don't want boiled eggs tomorrow morning,

1203
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,000
I want fried eggs.

1204
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,360
Medium rare.

1205
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Reply quickly.

1206
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,480
Mr. Huo,

1207
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,520
you didn't sleep?

1208
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,600
Why didn't you text me back

1209
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,760
or answer my calls,

1210
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,680
You're such

1211
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,120
a bad guy!

1212
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,840
But sometimes.

1213
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,080
You're fast asleep.

1214
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,600
It's cute.

1215
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,840
Silly girl.

1216
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,200
As I said yesterday,

1217
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,440
I only eat fried eggs.

1218
01:08:59,400 --> 01:08:59,920
Yesterday,

1219
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,960
you didn't say that,

1220
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,560
I sent you a message last night

1221
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,520
to remind you.

1222
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,240
Why didn't you

1223
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,800
text me back?

1224
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,760
My WeChat broke down yesterday,

1225
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:11,800
but,

1226
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,320
Other news,

1227
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,280
I haven't received it either.

1228
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,600
Is there really no such thing?

1229
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,440
Sorry,

1230
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,280
the number you dialed,

1231
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,400
Ming Xiao,

1232
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,920
your phone is in arrears,

1233
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,080
We had a deal.

1234
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,760
You want to be online 24 hours a day?

1235
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,600
I'm on call.

1236
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,160
I'm sorry.

1237
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,680
It's my fault.

1238
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,000
I'll recharge it next month.

1239
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,680
We don't have enough money.

1240
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,640
If anything happens to you,

1241
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,280
You just

1242
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,640
Call me louder,

1243
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,360
okay?

1244
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,520
How come you don't have money?

1245
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,080
Where's the salary Meng Guo gave you in advance,

1246
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,400
Fenfen said,

1247
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,880
Her boyfriend is sick

1248
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,360
and needs money,

1249
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,880
So I lent it to her.

1250
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,200
You really are.

1251
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,800
I'm not stupid.

1252
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,160
Don't be mean to me.

1253
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,240
Fenfen's boyfriend

1254
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,400
was short of money last time,

1255
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,680
I didn't even help.

1256
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,720
He's sick this time,

1257
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,320
do I have to help him?

1258
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,280
Mr. Huo

1259
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,760
is sick,

1260
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,480
It's hard.

1261
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,720
You're sick,

1262
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,400
I'll help you, too.

1263
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,080
Don't be mad at her.

1264
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,280
Okay?

1265
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,120
Forget it.

1266
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,200
It's done.

1267
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,240
See for yourself.

1268
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,000
You're wasting your money.

1269
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,560
Stupid,

1270
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,240
Ming Xiao,

1271
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,040
do you understand it or not?

1272
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,120
Thank others for their kindness.

1273
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:47,880
Forget it.

1274
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,720
I know you don't understand,

1275
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Let's talk less in the future.

1276
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,000
Keep your distance.
