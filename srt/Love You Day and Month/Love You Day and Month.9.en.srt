1
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,600
Xiaoxiao,

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
have you grown up

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,120
without me,

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,520
Then you will

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,720
become a better person.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,480
and live a happier life.

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,280
So,

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,720
we have to break up

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,760
peacefully

10
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,160
like mature adults.

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
Say goodbye.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
Piggy,

13
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,800
it's so hard to fall in love.

14
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,680
But what should we do?

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
I still like Mr. Huo so much.

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,400
I hope he'll come out soon.

17
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
When I see you, I can understand that

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
I can make a lot of money.

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,080
You can live a good life

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,320
like an adult,

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,080
Ming Xiao,

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
it's no use.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Why are you here?

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
I don't want to see you now.

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,480
Get out of here!

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,040
I should be the one

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
who kicked you out.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm Mrs. Huo now.

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
She's the mistress of this villa.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Besides,

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Huo Yun Ting

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,080
doesn't like you anymore.

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,120
So what?

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
Whether he likes me or not,

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
I will always

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
like him,

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
He would buy me

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,560
a lot of delicious food,

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Buy me a nice dress,

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
we chat together,

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,920
We cook together,

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
we shower together,

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,400
We watched the stars together,

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,880
anyway

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,400
What should I do?

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,280
He'll always be there for me.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,720
even if

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
He likes to get angry,

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,200
lose his temper with me,

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,240
I will still like him.

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,600
Okay,

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Let me put it another way.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,160
Do you like someone?

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,320
I just want him

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
to be happy every day, right?

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,160
But, Xiaoxiao?

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,800
Huo Yun Ting

58
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
won't be happy like this.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Why?

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm good to him.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,080
He's happy.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,160
Xiaoxiao,

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,240
all you do

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
is cook, wash clothes and sing children's songs,

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
It's not good enough.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,800
What Huo Yunting needs

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
is a smart, beautiful,

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Mrs. Huo who can support

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,040
and make money for him.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,000
Not a slow-witted girl

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,200
like you,

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,480
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,320
I don't understand.

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,080
But,

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,360
I can also make money.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,280
There's a lot of money

77
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
in it.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
I earned it myself.

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,560
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,000
Ming Xiao Xiao.

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,240
Lin Xi,

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,360
why are you here?

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,440
What's going on?

84
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,640
She,

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,560
She broke

86
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
my piggy bank.

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
My piggy bank

88
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,520
is gone.

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,960
Linxi, you can't just be

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
a piggy bank.

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Before we part,

92
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll give you

93
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,480
a new boss,

94
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Do you have to do this?

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,040
You and Xiaoxiao,

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,840
clearly in love with each other,

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,520
But you have to

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,560
lie to yourself and break up with him.

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
If it's just because

100
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
of your health,

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,000
If you do this to Xiaoxiao,

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,280
I think

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,880
it's too unfair to Xiaoxiao.

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,000
I believe that

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
even without the medical miracle,

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
The Huo family will certainly

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
be able to create a miracle.

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
Why can't you wait any longer?

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm willing to wait.

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,120
But Linxi is right,

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,160
I can't be so selfish.

112
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,520
Instead of letting Xiaoxiao

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,320
hold my photo,

114
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
If she's sad

115
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,880
for the rest of her life,

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
I might as well

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
send her away myself now.

118
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,160
She might

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,320
cry and make a scene,

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,680
Or you might

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
hold a grudge against me.

122
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
But time is a good medicine.

123
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,280
As long as she can make it through this period of time,

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,160
she will slowly

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,800
forget me.

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,640
Then we can

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
start over.

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,040
Meng Guo,

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
if I'm not here anymore,

130
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Please

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,360
take good care of Xiaoxiao

132
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,440
for me in the future.

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
She seems to be slow

134
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
in everything she does.

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,440
But actually,

136
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
he has a temper.

137
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,840
I have an idea.

138
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,680
If Lang Feng treats her badly

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,440
in the future.

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
You must protect her for me.

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Thank you so much.

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,240
By the way,

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
the broken piggy bank.

144
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
I hid a few new ones

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
in the storage room.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Give it to her

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,360
before I leave.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,360
Okay?

149
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,880
Take care of your wife

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,120
on your own.

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Anyway, I don't care.

152
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Yes.

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm sure.

154
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,680
It was James who set

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
a three-month deadline for Mr. Huo,

156
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,480
Professor,

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
as James's

158
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,280
best friend,

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,160
Please help me.

160
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,480
We can't find him now.

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Mr. Huo is in a bad situation now.

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,760
We have to find James.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,640
Only in this way can we have

164
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
the last chance to fight.

165
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay,

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,840
I'll wait for your news.

167
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,800
Hey,

168
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
You have to find Dr James for me

169
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,880
as soon as possible,

170
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,360
We're running out of time.

171
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,000
Hurry up!

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,360
Hey,

173
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,920
Mr. Lang,

174
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
please come here.

175
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,680
West side villa,

176
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Mr. Huo has something important to do,

177
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,480
Please do me a favor.

178
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Xiaoxiao,

179
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,880
even though we broke up,

180
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
But I'll leave the house to you.

181
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,240
You can still

182
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,960
stay here in the future.

183
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,640
The cake ice cream is in the fridge.

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
Every day, someone will come and get a new one.

185
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
But you can't eat it every day.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
The doll you like

187
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,080
is in the closet,

188
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
If the storage engineer

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,600
comes to do the cleaning,

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,400
You must cooperate.

191
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
Otherwise, it's easy for mites to be allergic.

192
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:29,880
Boss,

193
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,760
it's getting late.

194
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,760
It's time to go.

195
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,040
Anyway,

196
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,080
if you need to talk to Meng Guo in the future,

197
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,200
I guess

198
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
you'll be very busy.

199
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,600
Mr. Huo,

200
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
I don't want your house.

201
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,880
Why?

202
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,520
You've always wanted to

203
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,120
buy a house, haven't you?

204
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
That was before.

205
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,200
Now I know.

206
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,680
A house is not a home.

207
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,440
I don't want a house.

208
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
What I want is a home.

209
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Besides,

210
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
I have to have you at home.

211
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,960
What if it's not me?

212
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,760
Then I don't want anything.

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,200
I'll go alone.

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,680
Mr. Huo,

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
if you don't keep me,

216
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
I really have to go.

217
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,240
Xiaoxiao,

218
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,840
Xiaoxiao,

219
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Hey, Xiaoxiao, I'm coming.

220
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,520
Brother Lang Feng,

221
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
why are you here?

222
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
I asked Mr. Lang to come.

223
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,040
I'll be with you.

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,480
Take care of you,

225
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,720
Okay,

226
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Then I'll listen to Mr. Huo.

227
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,960
I'll leave.

228
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,040
You don't even want the piggy bank.

229
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Xiaoxiao,

230
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,000
she really hates me.

231
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,720
Xiaoxiao,

232
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
Brother Langfeng,

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,640
I'm sleepy.

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,160
I want to go to bed first.

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Why did you follow me?

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,680
Mr. Lang,

237
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
thank you

238
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,280
for picking up Xiaoxiao today,

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,640
If it's convenient,

240
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,280
there are some words,

241
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
I want to talk to you face to face.

242
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,360
What the hell are you doing?

243
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,800
And why on earth

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,680
did you break up with Xiaoxiao.

245
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Before answering these questions,

246
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,920
Lang Feng,

247
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,880
I want to ask you first.

248
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
Do you have any plans

249
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,320
for your future?

250
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,400
Me,

251
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,080
Could it be

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,480
You must always be

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,640
Linxi's accessory.

254
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Living with a tool man?

255
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
I know you already knew

256
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,720
why Miss Lin hired me.

257
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,080
Yeah,

258
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
in order to get Xiaoxiao back,

259
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm willing to be used as a gun by her.

260
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,360
But it won't happen again.

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,680
Huo Yun Ting,

262
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,080
although I don't like you very much,

263
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,080
But you're right.

264
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
I have to make my own decision.

265
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,120
A responsible man,

266
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,960
so I have to plan

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,280
my career and life well.

268
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,400
Of course,

269
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,960
this does not mean that

270
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,720
I will give up on Xiaoxiao,

271
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,600
On the contrary,

272
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I have to become stronger,

273
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,720
So that we can protect her better.

274
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,040
That's great.

275
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,000
Congratulations,

276
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,880
you've grown up,

277
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,520
In this way,

278
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,960
I can safely

279
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
hand over Xiaoxiao to you.

280
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,000
You.

281
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,920
Are you serious?

282
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,520
But for Xiaoxiao,

283
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,160
you wanted to cramp me

284
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,960
and skin me.

285
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't want to let her go.

286
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
But the premise is,

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
I have to live with my life.

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,440
Come on,

289
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,160
Xiaoxiao,

290
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,080
try it.

291
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
I remember this is

292
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
your favorite dish.

293
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
Mr. Huo said

294
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
it's not good to eat too much meat.

295
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
You have to eat it with vegetables,

296
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,120
so that you can be healthy.

297
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,160
That's why

298
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
I don't like it anymore.

299
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
But thank you all the same.

300
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,880
Brother Lang Feng,

301
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,000
silly girl,

302
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,160
Don't be so polite to me.

303
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,440
No way.

304
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,200
You still have to say thank you.

305
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,840
Mr. Huo said,

306
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,560
"Xiaoxiao,

307
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,200
Please stop talking about

308
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,200
Huo Yun Ting between us.

309
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,000
Like you said,

310
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,960
he's getting married.

311
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,160
If you keep seeing him,

312
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,560
you'll become

313
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,520
a third party,

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,560
Bad woman,

315
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,680
bad woman,

316
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
I don't want to be a third party.

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,920
Then forget him.

318
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,160
Look back at me,

319
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,840
Xiaoxiao,

320
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm always here.

321
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,200
Let's start over.

322
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,520
Come back to me.

323
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,160
Okay?

324
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,600
No rush.

325
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,400
Think about it

326
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,120
before you answer me.

327
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,880
We still have time.

328
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
You can stay here.

329
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,760
So,

330
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
the day before we left,

331
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,600
Tell me again.

332
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,400
Okay?

333
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,400
Xiaoxiao,

334
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Xiaoxiao,

335
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,400
You're no longer

336
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,480
a cleaning girl,

337
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,800
You don't have to do these things.

338
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,240
It's okay.

339
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,600
Me,

340
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm used to it.

341
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,120
Stop looking.

342
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,240
You can't go out.

343
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,800
Although Miss Lin promised,

344
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,560
we can stay here

345
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,120
temporarily,

346
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,080
But I specifically stressed that

347
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,960
you can't go out.

348
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
Why can't I go out?

349
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,520
puppy

350
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
They all want to go out

351
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
for a walk

352
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
Huo Yunting doesn't know,

353
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,400
We're still here.

354
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,960
If you go out now,

355
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
what if you run into him?

356
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,000
After all,

357
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,480
you've broken up.

358
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Mr. Huo is very busy with his work,

359
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,840
so he doesn't have time to go out.

360
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,000
You won't meet me.

361
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,040
Brother Lang Feng,

362
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
I'm just going out

363
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,200
for a while.

364
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Is that okay?

365
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't think so.

366
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,560
Huo Yun Ting,

367
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,640
he's going to prepare for the wedding.

368
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
What if he goes for a walk

369
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,920
with Miss Lin,

370
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,200
What if I run into you?

371
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
He was so busy,

372
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,840
I don't know

373
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
if he ate on time,

374
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,800
Sleep well.

375
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,080
I left in such a hurry

376
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,840
that I forgot

377
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,600
to sort his pills.

378
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
What should I do?

379
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,440
Okay,

380
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll go with you.

381
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
But only half an hour.

382
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,040
Besides,

383
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,840
I can't meet him.

384
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,160
Sure,

385
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
I'll just take a look,

386
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,400
He won't find out.

387
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Brother Lang Feng,

388
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,880
thank you.

389
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,160
All right. I can't

390
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,000
do anything about you.

391
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,920
Hold on.

392
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,640
I'm taking the equipment

393
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,160
with me. What equipment?

394
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,280
This won't do.

395
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,720
He,

396
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,320
He.

397
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,840
I didn't eat breakfast.

398
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,920
now

399
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
It's past

400
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,040
lunch time.

401
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,840
He still hasn't moved.

402
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,480
My stomach won't be able to take it.

403
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,360
Xiaoxiao,

404
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,840
it's almost time

405
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,760
for us to really go back.

406
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
It should be fine.

407
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,840
The Huo family's way of fighting back,

408
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,920
plus the news of

409
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,720
the Huo Lin family's marriage,

410
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
We managed to set

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,320
Dawson Group's backyard on fire.

412
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,760
In a short time,

413
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,200
they won't dare

414
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,840
to touch the Huo family again.

415
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,840
That's great.

416
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,080
It's not a waste

417
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,120
to work overtime all day and all night,

418
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,280
Come on,

419
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,080
Have some water.

420
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,440
Is she still here,

421
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:14,840
Xiaoxiao?

422
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,880
Yes,

423
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,080
I came early in the morning.

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,600
Besides,

425
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,960
he also took a telescope.

426
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,960
Open the door and window

427
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,520
a little more.

428
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,520
It's convenient for her to observe.

429
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,880
Yes.

430
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Forget it.

431
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,840
I can't always be

432
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,560
so out of control,

433
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,280
I wasted all my efforts before the meeting.

434
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,680
Let's go.

435
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,120
Boss,

436
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,120
take your medicine,

437
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,240
Eat it

438
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,000
No,

439
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,240
Eat it

440
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,640
Just break up.

441
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,360
I don't even want to die.

442
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Take the medicine.

443
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,640
Boss,

444
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,600
you love Xiaoxiao so much,

445
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
So you have to live a few more days?

446
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,840
Am I right?

447
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,400
That's the only way you can

448
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
see her for a few more days,

449
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,760
There's nothing like it.

450
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,840
Looking at the person you love,

451
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,920
it's better to live

452
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,640
a happy life.

453
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,440
Am I right?

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
In this world,

455
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,800
there's nothing like saving a drowning man.

456
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,480
And he broke his driftwood with his own hands.

457
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
It's even crueler.

458
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,040
I hope she forgets me.

459
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
I'm afraid she'll really forget me.

460
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,480
Meng Guo,

461
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,840
I think I'm crazy.

462
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,200
I really can't stand it anymore.

463
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,320
I'll get Xiaoxiao back

464
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
for you right now.

465
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,520
No.

466
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Don't call her back.

467
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,840
It took me a long time

468
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,720
to make it this far,

469
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,000
It took a lot of effort

470
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,880
to set her free.

471
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,120
I can't let her get stuck

472
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
in this mess anymore.

473
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Meng Guo,

474
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,480
you're right.

475
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,440
I should live a few more days.

476
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,360
Make an appointment to go to the hospital.

477
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,240
Okay.

478
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,680
Xiaoxiao,

479
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,800
have you grown up

480
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
without me,

481
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,600
Then you will

482
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
become a better person.

483
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,560
and live a happier life.

484
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,360
So,

485
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,800
we have to break up

486
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,840
peacefully

487
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,240
like mature adults.

488
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Say goodbye.

489
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,480
Piggy,

490
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,880
it's so hard to fall in love.

491
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,760
But what should we do?

492
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,880
I still like Mr. Huo so much.

493
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,480
I hope he'll come out soon.

494
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,200
When I see you, I can understand that

495
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,120
I can make a lot of money.

496
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,160
You can live a good life

497
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,400
like an adult,

498
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,160
Ming Xiao,

499
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,360
it's no use.

500
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,080
Why are you here?

501
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,400
I don't want to see you now.

502
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,560
Get out of here!

503
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,520
I should be the one

504
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,600
who kicked you out.

505
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,400
I'm Mrs. Huo now.

506
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,480
She's the mistress of this villa.

507
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,560
Besides,

508
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,480
Huo Yun Ting

509
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,160
doesn't like you anymore.

510
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,200
So what?

511
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,200
Whether he likes me or not,

512
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,560
I will always

513
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,280
like him,

514
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,600
He would buy me

515
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,640
a lot of delicious food,

516
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,440
Buy me a nice dress,

517
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,960
we chat together,

518
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,000
We cook together,

519
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,520
we shower together,

520
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,480
We watched the stars together,

521
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:57,960
anyway

522
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,480
What should I do?

523
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,360
He'll always be there for me.

524
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,800
even if

525
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,080
He likes to get angry,

526
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,280
lose his temper with me,

527
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,320
I will still like him.

528
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,680
Okay,

529
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,840
Let me put it another way.

530
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,240
Do you like someone?

531
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,400
I just want him

532
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,680
to be happy every day, right?

533
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,240
But, Xiaoxiao?

534
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,880
Huo Yun Ting

535
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,120
won't be happy like this.

536
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,120
Why?

537
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,880
I'm good to him.

538
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
He's happy.

539
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,240
Xiaoxiao,

540
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,320
all you do

541
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
is cook, wash clothes and sing children's songs,

542
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,400
It's not good enough.

543
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,880
What Huo Yunting needs

544
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,640
is a smart, beautiful,

545
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,040
Mrs. Huo who can support

546
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,120
and make money for him.

547
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,080
Not a slow-witted girl

548
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,280
like you,

549
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
What are you talking about?

550
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,400
I don't understand.

551
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,160
But,

552
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,440
I can also make money.

553
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,360
There's a lot of money

554
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,080
in it.

555
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
I earned it myself.

556
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,640
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

557
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,080
Ming Xiao Xiao.

558
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,320
Lin Xi,

559
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,440
why are you here?

560
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,520
What's going on?

561
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,720
She,

562
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,640
She broke

563
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
my piggy bank.

564
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,920
My piggy bank

565
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,600
is gone.

566
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,040
Linxi, you can't just be

567
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
a piggy bank.

568
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,960
Before we part,

569
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
I'll give you

570
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,560
a new boss,

571
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,880
Do you have to do this?

572
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,120
You and Xiaoxiao,

573
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,920
clearly in love with each other,

574
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,600
But you have to

575
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,640
lie to yourself and break up with him.

576
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
If it's just because

577
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,720
of your health,

578
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
If you do this to Xiaoxiao,

579
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,360
I think

580
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,960
it's too unfair to Xiaoxiao.

581
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,080
I believe that

582
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,120
even without the medical miracle,

583
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,280
The Huo family will certainly

584
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
be able to create a miracle.

585
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,680
Why can't you wait any longer?

586
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,040
I'm willing to wait.

587
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
But Linxi is right,

588
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,240
I can't be so selfish.

589
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,600
Instead of letting Xiaoxiao

590
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,400
hold my photo,

591
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,360
If she's sad

592
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,960
for the rest of her life,

593
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
I might as well

594
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,440
send her away myself now.

595
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,240
She might

596
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
cry and make a scene,

597
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,760
Or you might

598
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,760
hold a grudge against me.

599
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,960
But time is a good medicine.

600
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,360
As long as she can make it through this period of time,

601
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,240
she will slowly

602
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
forget me.

603
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,720
Then we can

604
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,080
start over.

605
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,120
Meng Guo,

606
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,320
if I'm not here anymore,

607
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Please

608
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
take good care of Xiaoxiao

609
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,520
for me in the future.

610
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,320
She seems to be slow

611
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
in everything she does.

612
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,520
But actually,

613
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,760
he has a temper.

614
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,920
I have an idea.

615
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,760
If Lang Feng treats her badly

616
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,520
in the future.

617
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,080
You must protect her for me.

618
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,200
Thank you so much.

619
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,320
By the way,

620
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
the broken piggy bank.

621
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,000
I hid a few new ones

622
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
in the storage room.

623
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,880
Give it to her

624
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,440
before I leave.

625
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay?

626
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,960
Take care of your wife

627
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,200
on your own.

628
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,560
Anyway, I don't care.

629
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,440
Yes.

630
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,680
I'm sure.

631
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
It was James who set

632
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,720
a three-month deadline for Mr. Huo,

633
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,560
Professor,

634
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,600
as James's

635
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,360
best friend,

636
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,240
Please help me.

637
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,560
We can't find him now.

638
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,480
Mr. Huo is in a bad situation now.

639
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
We have to find James.

640
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,720
Only in this way can we have

641
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
the last chance to fight.

642
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Okay,

643
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,920
I'll wait for your news.

644
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:15,880
Hey,

645
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
You have to find Dr James for me

646
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,960
as soon as possible,

647
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,440
We're running out of time.

648
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,080
Hurry up!

649
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,440
Hey,

650
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,000
Mr. Lang,

651
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,120
please come here.

652
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,760
West side villa,

653
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Mr. Huo has something important to do,

654
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,560
Please do me a favor.

655
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,880
Xiaoxiao,

656
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,960
even though we broke up,

657
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,360
But I'll leave the house to you.

658
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,320
You can still

659
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,040
stay here in the future.

660
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,720
The cake ice cream is in the fridge.

661
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,120
Every day, someone will come and get a new one.

662
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,880
But you can't eat it every day.

663
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,360
The doll you like

664
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,160
is in the closet,

665
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,880
If the storage engineer

666
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,680
comes to do the cleaning,

667
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,480
You must cooperate.

668
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,680
Otherwise, it's easy for mites to be allergic.

669
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:26,960
Boss,

670
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,840
it's getting late.

671
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,840
It's time to go.

672
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,120
Anyway,

673
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,160
if you need to talk to Meng Guo in the future,

674
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,280
I guess

675
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,360
you'll be very busy.

676
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,680
Mr. Huo,

677
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
I don't want your house.

678
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:40,960
Why?

679
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,600
You've always wanted to

680
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,200
buy a house, haven't you?

681
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,280
That was before.

682
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,280
Now I know.

683
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,760
A house is not a home.

684
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,520
I don't want a house.

685
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,960
What I want is a home.

686
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,640
Besides,

687
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,800
I have to have you at home.

688
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,040
What if it's not me?

689
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,840
Then I don't want anything.

690
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,280
I'll go alone.

691
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,760
Mr. Huo,

692
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,160
if you don't keep me,

693
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,720
I really have to go.

694
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,320
Xiaoxiao,

695
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,920
Xiaoxiao,

696
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,680
Hey, Xiaoxiao, I'm coming.

697
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,600
Brother Lang Feng,

698
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,520
why are you here?

699
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,120
I asked Mr. Lang to come.

700
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,120
I'll be with you.

701
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,560
Take care of you,

702
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,800
Okay,

703
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,600
Then I'll listen to Mr. Huo.

704
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,040
I'll leave.

705
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,120
You don't even want the piggy bank.

706
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,520
Xiaoxiao,

707
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
she really hates me.

708
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,800
Xiaoxiao,

709
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,000
Brother Langfeng,

710
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,720
I'm sleepy.

711
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,240
I want to go to bed first.

712
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Why did you follow me?

713
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,760
Mr. Lang,

714
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,640
thank you

715
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,360
for picking up Xiaoxiao today,

716
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,720
If it's convenient,

717
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,360
there are some words,

718
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I want to talk to you face to face.

719
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,440
What the hell are you doing?

720
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:29,880
And why on earth

721
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,760
did you break up with Xiaoxiao.

722
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
Before answering these questions,

723
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,000
Lang Feng,

724
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,960
I want to ask you first.

725
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,200
Do you have any plans

726
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,400
for your future?

727
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,480
Me,

728
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,160
Could it be

729
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,560
You must always be

730
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,720
Linxi's accessory.

731
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Living with a tool man?

732
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,880
I know you already knew

733
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,800
why Miss Lin hired me.

734
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,160
Yeah,

735
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,480
in order to get Xiaoxiao back,

736
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,680
I'm willing to be used as a gun by her.

737
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,440
But it won't happen again.

738
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,760
Huo Yun Ting,

739
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,160
although I don't like you very much,

740
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,160
But you're right.

741
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I have to make my own decision.

742
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,200
A responsible man,

743
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,040
so I have to plan

744
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,360
my career and life well.

745
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,480
Of course,

746
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,040
this does not mean that

747
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,800
I will give up on Xiaoxiao,

748
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,680
On the contrary,

749
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
I have to become stronger,

750
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,800
So that we can protect her better.

751
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,120
That's great.

752
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,080
Congratulations,

753
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,960
you've grown up,

754
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,600
In this way,

755
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,040
I can safely

756
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,120
hand over Xiaoxiao to you.

757
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,080
You.

758
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,000
Are you serious?

759
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,600
But for Xiaoxiao,

760
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,240
you wanted to cramp me

761
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,040
and skin me.

762
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,040
I don't want to let her go.

763
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,800
But the premise is,

764
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,240
I have to live with my life.

765
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,520
Come on,

766
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,240
Xiaoxiao,

767
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,160
try it.

768
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,480
I remember this is

769
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,480
your favorite dish.

770
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,680
Mr. Huo said

771
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,120
it's not good to eat too much meat.

772
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,760
You have to eat it with vegetables,

773
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,200
so that you can be healthy.

774
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,240
That's why

775
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,760
I don't like it anymore.

776
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,120
But thank you all the same.

777
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,960
Brother Lang Feng,

778
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,080
silly girl,

779
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,240
Don't be so polite to me.

780
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,520
No way.

781
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,280
You still have to say thank you.

782
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,920
Mr. Huo said,

783
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:28,640
"Xiaoxiao,

784
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,280
Please stop talking about

785
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,280
Huo Yun Ting between us.

786
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,080
Like you said,

787
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,040
he's getting married.

788
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,240
If you keep seeing him,

789
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,640
you'll become

790
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,600
a third party,

791
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,640
Bad woman,

792
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,760
bad woman,

793
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,560
I don't want to be a third party.

794
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,000
Then forget him.

795
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,240
Look back at me,

796
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,920
Xiaoxiao,

797
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm always here.

798
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,280
Let's start over.

799
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,600
Come back to me.

800
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,240
Okay?

801
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,680
No rush.

802
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,480
Think about it

803
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,200
before you answer me.

804
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,960
We still have time.

805
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,800
You can stay here.

806
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:11,840
So,

807
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
the day before we left,

808
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,680
Tell me again.

809
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,480
Okay?

810
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,480
Xiaoxiao,

811
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,200
Xiaoxiao,

812
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,480
You're no longer

813
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,560
a cleaning girl,

814
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,880
You don't have to do these things.

815
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,320
It's okay.

816
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:35,680
Me,

817
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,240
I'm used to it.

818
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,200
Stop looking.

819
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,320
You can't go out.

820
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,880
Although Miss Lin promised,

821
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,640
we can stay here

822
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,200
temporarily,

823
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,160
But I specifically stressed that

824
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,040
you can't go out.

825
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,520
Why can't I go out?

826
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,600
puppy

827
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,240
They all want to go out

828
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,560
for a walk

829
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,640
Huo Yunting doesn't know,

830
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,480
We're still here.

831
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,040
If you go out now,

832
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,520
what if you run into him?

833
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,080
After all,

834
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,560
you've broken up.

835
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,600
Mr. Huo is very busy with his work,

836
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,920
so he doesn't have time to go out.

837
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,080
You won't meet me.

838
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,120
Brother Lang Feng,

839
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,360
I'm just going out

840
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,280
for a while.

841
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Is that okay?

842
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,480
I don't think so.

843
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,640
Huo Yun Ting,

844
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,720
he's going to prepare for the wedding.

845
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,360
What if he goes for a walk

846
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,000
with Miss Lin,

847
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,280
What if I run into you?

848
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,880
He was so busy,

849
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,920
I don't know

850
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,040
if he ate on time,

851
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,880
Sleep well.

852
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,160
I left in such a hurry

853
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,920
that I forgot

854
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,680
to sort his pills.

855
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,280
What should I do?

856
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,520
Okay,

857
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,680
I'll go with you.

858
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,160
But only half an hour.

859
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,120
Besides,

860
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,920
I can't meet him.

861
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,240
Sure,

862
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,960
I'll just take a look,

863
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,480
He won't find out.

864
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:57,880
Brother Lang Feng,

865
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,960
thank you.

866
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,240
All right. I can't

867
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,080
do anything about you.

868
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,000
Hold on.

869
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm taking the equipment

870
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,240
with me. What equipment?

871
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,360
This won't do.

872
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:31,800
He,

873
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:32,400
He.

874
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,920
I didn't eat breakfast.

875
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,000
now

876
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,440
It's past

877
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,120
lunch time.

878
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,920
He still hasn't moved.

879
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,560
My stomach won't be able to take it.

880
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,440
Xiaoxiao,

881
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,920
it's almost time

882
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,840
for us to really go back.

883
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,320
It should be fine.

884
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,920
The Huo family's way of fighting back,

885
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,000
plus the news of

886
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,800
the Huo Lin family's marriage,

887
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,680
We managed to set

888
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,400
Dawson Group's backyard on fire.

889
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,840
In a short time,

890
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,280
they won't dare

891
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,920
to touch the Huo family again.

892
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,920
That's great.

893
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,160
It's not a waste

894
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,200
to work overtime all day and all night,

895
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,360
Come on,

896
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,160
Have some water.

897
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,520
Is she still here,

898
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,920
Xiaoxiao?

899
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,960
Yes,

900
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,160
I came early in the morning.

901
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,680
Besides,

902
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,040
he also took a telescope.

903
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,040
Open the door and window

904
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,600
a little more.

905
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,600
It's convenient for her to observe.

906
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,960
Yes.

907
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,320
Forget it.

908
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,920
I can't always be

909
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,640
so out of control,

910
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,360
I wasted all my efforts before the meeting.

911
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,760
Let's go.

912
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,200
Boss,

913
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,200
take your medicine,

914
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,320
Eat it

915
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,080
No,

916
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,320
Eat it

917
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,720
Just break up.

918
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,440
I don't even want to die.

919
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:03,280
Take the medicine.

920
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,720
Boss,

921
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,680
you love Xiaoxiao so much,

922
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,520
So you have to live a few more days?

923
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:29,920
Am I right?

924
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,480
That's the only way you can

925
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,600
see her for a few more days,
