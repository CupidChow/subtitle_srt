1
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
What good news?

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,880
The first good news is that

3
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,120
I have graduated successfully.

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,000
And also got

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Certificate of Honor for Outstanding Graduates

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Brother Long Feng,

7
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
You're great.

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,680
I knew it.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
You're the best.

10
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
The second good news is that

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
The boss assigned me to work here.

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,640
What about

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Are you happy?

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Really?

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,000
very good

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,240
Are we going to

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
We can meet every day.

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,880
However

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,960
Aunt, will she agree?

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,480
She doesn't like our meeting.

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,440
My mom is like that.

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
Don't bother her.

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,880
Xiaoxiao

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,280
I'm already an adult.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:02,960
In the future,

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,400
I have to earn a lot of money.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Will form their own family.

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,360
anyway

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,600
I want to be with you.

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,040
Well

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
I will try my best.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,360
In the future,

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Let's work together.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Come on.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,760
You will have your own family.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,720
Well

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,000
There will be

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Our own little home.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,240
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
She usually goes to work

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,000
You didn't check your phone once a day.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,080
today

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,040
A hundred times an hour.

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Yes?

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,440
Is it with your

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
My childhood friend's neighbor.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,240
It's related.

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
You had a fight?

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,160
There was no fight.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,920
Brother Long Feng and I

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,400
Never quarreled.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,520
originally

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,440
He said he would accompany me today.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,800
but

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,120
Suddenly, there's something else.

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,280
I have to handle one thing.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
So I didn't come.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,280
Boss

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,320
Take the medicine first.

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,880
Boss, the doctor will be there soon.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,840
Has pressed the emergency on.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,640
Hold on.

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,560
may not

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can't call a doctor.

65
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,480
We can't allow outsiders

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,640
You know my condition.

67
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,080
Go away.

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,160
Go away.

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Boss

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,240
I can't take care of so many things now.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
Your life is the most important.

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,120
Meng Guo.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm your boss.

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
I've been sick for so long.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,880
For so long.

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,200
No one knows.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,120
How much is my disease?

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,880
Call the doctor now.

79
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
To kill me.

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,760
Leave.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Leave.

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,360
Are you stupid?

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,320
She said

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,680
I have something important to do.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
That means you're not important enough.

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
You were tricked.

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,400
I won't.

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Brother Long Feng,

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
You won't lie to me.

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,680
As long as I'm on the phone,

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
He will come.

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,440
The brainless Miss Spring.

93
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
It's hopeless.

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
What is Sichun?

95
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
Hey, hey.

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,880
The owner of West Block 2 has an emergency.

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
I need a cleaner to clean it.

98
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,040
That Yufen.

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,880
And Xiao Xiao.

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,640
You two, come closer.

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,640
Go there.

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,640
West Zone 2.

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Good gracious!

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,880
It's Mr. Huo again.

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,960
President Huo.

106
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh my!

107
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,280
My stomach hurts so much.

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
Xiao Xiao, go there first.

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,400
I have to go to the restroom.

110
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,840
Boss

111
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
Your illness will only get worse.

112
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Why don't you understand?

113
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,240
Get out of here.

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Ming Xiao, I want you to clean it.

115
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,560
Why did you force Mr. Huo to take the medicine?

116
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,680
It tastes good.

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Your craftsmanship has improved.

118
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,200
You can praise people in a sly manner.

119
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
You seem to have recovered.

120
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm really praising you.

122
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,520
That

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,760
Sorry about yesterday.

124
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,960
I shouldn't scold you.

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,320
I know that.

126
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
You are different from them.

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
President Huo, the black face,

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,240
You even apologized.

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,840
It seems I have to thank you.

130
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
Our Miss Xiao.

131
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,680
She's not making congee.

132
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,040
It's simply the kindness and beauty of the world.

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,360
Is the light of the right path.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,480
what

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,440
You said Ming Xiao cooked this?

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,520
Of course.

137
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,480
My cooking skills

138
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
It's not like you don't know.

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,240
You are not allowed to fix it.

140
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
The live-in nanny and health care doctor.

141
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,000
So,

142
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,560
A homely meal like this.

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's eat and cherish it.

144
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,240
It's not like you don't know.

145
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm not used to strangers.

146
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
You're not used to strangers.

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
Treat everyone as an enemy.

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,720
I was wrong.

149
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,320
Having dinner

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Manager Wang is here.

151
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,520
Please have a seat.

152
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,400
Mr. Huo is waiting for you.

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,880
President Huo.

154
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
I heard from Meng Teisuke.

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,080
You want to take Ming Xiao Xiao

156
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,880
To this building.

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
For the villa.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
Xiao Xiao, right?

159
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,200
She's special.

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,200
she

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,640
Your ideas are simpler than ordinary people.

162
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,720
And reacts slowly.

163
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
If she offended you in any way,

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,720
I hope that

165
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,680
Your Excellency, there are plenty of them.

166
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
Don't be angry.

167
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,240
If you have any dissatisfaction,

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,320
You can tell me at any time.

169
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,080
I'll teach her.

170
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
What did Manager Wang say?

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,440
as if

172
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm a bully.

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
As a bad girl.

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,960
Nothing.

175
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,560
Don't dare.

176
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,960
I specially asked you here today.

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
Actually, I think

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,800
Ming Xiao Xiao is very capable.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,960
So I hope she can

180
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,360
Take care of my side.

181
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
You can be at your beck and call.

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
You can do whatever you want.

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,720
That's enough.

184
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,520
What is this?

185
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,080
MingXiaoxiao

186
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
Whether you're stupid or pretending to be stupid,

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,520
Come to me.

188
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,280
Your life will be over.

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,520
Miss Lin,

190
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
You came to rest at the resort.

191
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,080
What's wrong?

192
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Meng Te, help me.

193
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
There are so many problems.

194
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I didn't even know

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
Which one did you answer?

196
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
not as good as

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,800
Let's go inside and talk about it.

198
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,560
Sorry, Miss Lin.

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Private houses can't be broken into.

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,440
I'm looking for President Huo.

201
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,640
Miss Lin is joking.

202
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
Mr. Huo is a busy man.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
How could you stay here every day?

204
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
Meng Tezhu is really dedicated.

205
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
President Huo is not here.

206
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,520
Why are you holding so many files?

207
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,000
To yourself.

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
Sorry, Miss Lin.

209
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm here today.

210
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
You won't be able to get in.

211
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
What if I insist?

212
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,240
Meng Guo.

213
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Please come in.

214
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,200
Miss Lin, please.

215
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
Meng Tezhu.

216
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
You're a smart man.

217
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
Take a long-term view.

218
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
Don't stop me from seeing President Huo.

219
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,520
maybe

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,280
You have to change your mind.

221
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
She called me Mrs. Huo.

222
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Good luck.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
There are many people who want to be Mrs. Huo.

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,040
What makes you think

225
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
Are you qualified for Mrs. Huo?

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
The Lin Group is still valuable.

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm Mrs. Huo.

228
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
Its absolute controlling interest.

229
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,040
It's a dowry.

230
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,120
Miss Lin,

231
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm afraid that you're not interested

232
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,040
The current dilemma

233
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
And survived.

234
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,200
To tell you the truth,

235
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,920
As long as I want,

236
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Huo's family.

237
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Any time.

238
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,760
To buy the Lin family.

239
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,880
What if I say,

240
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Huo Feng Lei also

241
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
The same condition?

242
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,720
President Huo.

243
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
I have a file.

244
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
You may take a look.

245
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,960
What do you mean?

246
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Take a fake file.

247
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,360
And wanted to threaten me.

248
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,800
My health is good or bad.

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,840
I guess you can see it clearly.

250
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,800
Since I came in,

251
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,400
Mr. Huo's posture

252
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
But he hasn't changed a bit.

253
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,840
Your physical condition

254
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
How about this?

255
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,800
You know?

256
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,920
I know.

257
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,360
But President Huo

258
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
You still misunderstood me.

259
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,880
If I want to,

260
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
To threaten you,

261
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,480
This document will appear on

262
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,640
Huo Fenglei's hands

263
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Instead of what we have now.

264
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,240
At the negotiating table,

265
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,920
Huo Yunting

266
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,720
You need me.

267
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,200
and

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
The Huo family's company

269
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,480
I also need one.

270
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,920
That Mrs. Huo can handle.

271
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,760
Miss Lin,

272
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,760
I think you probably

273
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,720
You still don't know much about me.

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm

275
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
She was heartless.

276
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,840
Now it's...

277
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
The leader of the Huo family.

278
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,720
That's even more outrageous.

279
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
You're the only child in the Lin family.

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
Stay away from me.

281
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
Don't worry about Mr. Lin.

282
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Meng Guo.

283
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,800
to see a visitor out

284
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
Please, Miss Lin.

285
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,880
President Huo.

286
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
I think

287
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,920
Is frank enough.

288
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I hope you can think about it.

289
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,040
Of course

290
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Even if you don't agree,

291
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,200
I will also destroy

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
This medical report

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,880
Keep it a secret from you.

294
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,360
Miss Lin,

295
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,400
I always think

296
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,840
A family or a business.

297
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,760
If I end up

298
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,960
To exchange marriage for marriage.

299
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
Peace and resources

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,280
that

301
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,600
It is not necessary to be saved.

302
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,160
My opinion.

303
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,840
To share it with you.

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,760
Boss, stay in the sun for a while.

305
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,480
It's good for your health.

306
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,360
Your phone ringtone has been ringing

307
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,040
It's not broken.

308
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,400
Who is it?

309
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Looking for you.

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,640
My foster mother.

311
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
She had a stroke in her hometown two days ago.

312
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I've paid enough.

313
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,000
And hired a minder.

314
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
But she still asked the hospital

315
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,040
To urge me every day.

316
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I don't know what I'm urging.

317
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,040
That...

318
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,680
Your foster mother who abused you as a child.

319
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
It's really hard for Meng Tezhu.

320
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,440
You have to take care of them everywhere.

321
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
A half-dead person.

322
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:16,920
That's enough.

323
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll give you a week off.

324
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Hurry up.

325
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
Deal with the trifles.

326
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,120
But I'm leaving.

327
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
What about you?

328
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,320
Xiaoxiao

329
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,240
Brother Meng.

330
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,600
I've eaten so many cupcakes.

331
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,120
Can I go to work now?

332
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
It's not important now.

333
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,880
Xiaoxiao

334
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,760
I'm very sincere now.

335
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
To invite you again.

336
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
Keep an eye on Mr. Huo.

337
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,160
I hope you can think about it.

338
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,600
but

339
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
I have many more.

340
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
To do other work.

341
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,560
and

342
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Mr. Huo,

343
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,520
Don't be naughty.

344
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,240
After I leave,

345
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,200
He listens to you.

346
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,280
Besides, Mr. Huo,

347
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
He's a patient.

348
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
So you have to let him

349
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,760
but

350
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,120
He doesn't like me.

351
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,920
Trust me.

352
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,360
President Huo will like you.

353
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,880
to wait a moment

354
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,160
I know.

355
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
After three days,

356
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,200
I'll go to the hospital when I land.

357
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,200
Alright

358
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,960
That's it.

359
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,760
Xiaoxiao

360
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,880
As you can see,

361
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm leaving soon.

362
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,000
Mr. Huo is alone.

363
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,040
And limping.

364
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,360
If you don't take care of him,

365
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
Will be pitiful.

366
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,640
that

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,760
Alright then.

368
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,000
However

369
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,280
Really?

370
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
For three months.

371
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,480
So many bonuses?

372
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,800
Of course.

373
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,600
If you do well,

374
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,040
There will be a bonus.

375
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,040
good

376
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
Xiao Xiao never lies.

377
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,760
I'll definitely do that.

378
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,960
I believe in you.

379
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,280
Xiaoxiao

380
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,800
Mr. Huo's movement is inconvenient.

381
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,320
So work hard.

382
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,120
To take care of him.

383
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,200
All the food and clothing.

384
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,080
How about this?

385
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Although you will work hard,

386
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,160
But Mr. Huo's body

387
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,760
I refuse.

388
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,080
I can accept that.

389
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
A fool will be the cleaner.

390
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,440
But I can't.

391
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
At the mercy of a fool.

392
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm not stupid.

393
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
I was just slow.

394
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,560
Well

395
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I will work hard.

396
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,520
and

397
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
You're limping.

398
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,600
I didn't hate you.

399
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,320
yes

400
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,720
You're not stupid.

401
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,680
I'm stupid.

402
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,280
That's why I asked you

403
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,440
You're here to irritate me every day.

404
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,240
See?

405
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Mr. Huo is in poor health.

406
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,200
So he has a bad temper.

407
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,400
What if?

408
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,920
If he's angry,

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,960
Just call me.

410
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,160
Or what?

411
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,240
You can hide.

412
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,200
What is the guarantee?

413
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
He doesn't hurt himself.

414
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,400
Just live.

415
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,640
I know.

416
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,360
alive

417
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,160
alive

418
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,400
Brother Long Feng,

419
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,400
You finally called me back.

420
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,120
Luckily, I learned to use WeChat.

421
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,440
I can see you now.

422
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Sorry, Xiao Xiao.

423
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,120
I've been too busy recently.

424
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,840
and

425
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,200
I didn't expect that

426
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,360
My mom will come to check on me suddenly.

427
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,160
I didn't accompany you.

428
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
I'm really sorry.

429
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,680
Xiao Xiao,

430
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,640
You're really a miser.

431
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,440
Remember,

432
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,680
I've been working hard with you.

433
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,360
Correct!

434
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,200
When we meet next time,

435
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,400
I have a little surprise for you.

436
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Well

437
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,880
Xiao Feng.

438
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,560
Who are you talking to?

439
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,080
Is that fool Ming Xiao Xiao?

440
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
How many times have I told you?

441
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,480
Don't contact her.

442
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,120
mom

443
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,240
Stop it.

444
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,720
Why didn't you listen?

445
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,880
You want to piss me off?

446
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,640
Fool

447
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,120
You were tricked.

448
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,680
For such a wild man,

449
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,840
It's not worth it.

450
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
Brother Long Feng won't lie to me.

451
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,080
It's his mother.

452
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,920
Don't like me.

453
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:37,960
first

454
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
People like you

455
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,840
I can't afford a house even if I work all my life.

456
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,680
second

457
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,520
What are you talking about?

458
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,720
Brother Feng,

459
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,200
Is an irresponsible man.

460
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
His mother is so fierce.

461
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,640
I won't let you be together.

462
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,320
So Ming Xiao Xiao

463
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,000
You'll end up with nothing.

464
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,480
Mr. Huo,

465
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,840
You're the best

466
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,520
The worst.

467
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,160
scoundrel

468
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,880
I hate you.

469
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,280
Xiaoxiao

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,840
What happened yesterday?

471
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,480
I know everything.

472
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,080
What's next, you two?

473
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,680
And stay together.

474
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
For a week?

475
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Just forgive him, okay?

476
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,640
I suddenly remembered that

477
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,120
Are you saving money recently?

478
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
What good news?

479
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,720
The first good news is that

480
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,960
I have graduated successfully.

481
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,840
And also got

482
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,000
Certificate of Honor for Outstanding Graduates

483
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,080
Brother Long Feng,

484
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,360
You're great.

485
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,520
I knew it.

486
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,760
You're the best.

487
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,480
The second good news is that

488
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
The boss assigned me to work here.

489
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,480
What about

490
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,120
Are you happy?

491
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,080
Really?

492
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,840
very good

493
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Are we going to

494
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,240
We can meet every day.

495
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,720
However

496
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
Aunt, will she agree?

497
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,320
She doesn't like our meeting.

498
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,280
My mom is like that.

499
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,080
Don't bother her.

500
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,720
Xiaoxiao

501
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm already an adult.

502
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:15,800
In the future,

503
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,240
I have to earn a lot of money.

504
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,160
Will form their own family.

505
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,200
anyway

506
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,440
I want to be with you.

507
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:22,880
Well

508
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I will try my best.

509
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,200
In the future,

510
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,040
Let's work together.

511
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,080
Come on.

512
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,600
You will have your own family.

513
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,560
Well

514
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,840
There will be

515
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Our own little home.

516
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,240
What's wrong with you?

517
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,520
She usually goes to work

518
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,840
You didn't check your phone once a day.

519
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,920
today

520
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,880
A hundred times an hour.

521
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,920
Yes?

522
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,280
Is it with your

523
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,640
My childhood friend's neighbor.

524
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,080
It's related.

525
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,320
You had a fight?

526
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
There was no fight.

527
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,760
Brother Long Feng and I

528
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,240
Never quarreled.

529
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,360
originally

530
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,280
He said he would accompany me today.

531
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,640
but

532
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,960
Suddenly, there's something else.

533
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120
I have to handle one thing.

534
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,680
So I didn't come.

535
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,120
Boss

536
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,160
Take the medicine first.

537
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,720
Boss, the doctor will be there soon.

538
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,680
Has pressed the emergency on.

539
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,480
Hold on.

540
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,400
may not

541
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
You can't call a doctor.

542
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,320
We can't allow outsiders

543
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,480
You know my condition.

544
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,920
Go away.

545
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,000
Go away.

546
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,000
Boss

547
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,080
I can't take care of so many things now.

548
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Your life is the most important.

549
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,960
Meng Guo.

550
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I'm your boss.

551
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
I've been sick for so long.

552
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
For so long.

553
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,040
No one knows.

554
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,960
How much is my disease?

555
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
Call the doctor now.

556
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
To kill me.

557
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
Leave.

558
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,640
Leave.

559
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
Are you stupid?

560
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,160
She said

561
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,520
I have something important to do.

562
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,760
That means you're not important enough.

563
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,320
You were tricked.

564
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,240
I won't.

565
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Brother Long Feng,

566
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,640
You won't lie to me.

567
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,520
As long as I'm on the phone,

568
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,800
He will come.

569
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,280
The brainless Miss Spring.

570
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,080
It's hopeless.

571
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,640
What is Sichun?

572
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
Hey, hey.

573
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,720
The owner of West Block 2 has an emergency.

574
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
I need a cleaner to clean it.

575
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,880
That Yufen.

576
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,720
And Xiao Xiao.

577
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,480
You two, come closer.

578
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,480
Go there.

579
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,480
West Zone 2.

580
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,200
Good gracious!

581
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,720
It's Mr. Huo again.

582
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
President Huo.

583
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
Oh my!

584
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,120
My stomach hurts so much.

585
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Xiao Xiao, go there first.

586
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,240
I have to go to the restroom.

587
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,680
Boss

588
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,960
Your illness will only get worse.

589
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Why don't you understand?

590
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,080
Get out of here.

591
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
It tastes good.

592
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,440
Your craftsmanship has improved.

593
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,040
You can praise people in a sly manner.

594
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
You seem to have recovered.

595
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,200
What are you talking about?

596
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm really praising you.

597
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,360
That

598
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,600
Sorry about yesterday.

599
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,800
I shouldn't scold you.

600
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,160
I know that.

601
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
You are different from them.

602
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,440
President Huo, the black face,

603
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,080
You even apologized.

604
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
It seems I have to thank you.

605
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Our Miss Xiao.

606
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,520
She's not making congee.

607
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
It's simply the kindness and beauty of the world.

608
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,200
Is the light of the right path.

609
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,320
what

610
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,280
You said Ming Xiao cooked this?

611
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,360
Of course.

612
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,320
My cooking skills

613
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,160
It's not like you don't know.

614
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,080
You are not allowed to fix it.

615
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
The live-in nanny and health care doctor.

616
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,840
So,

617
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,400
A homely meal like this.

618
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,800
Let's eat and cherish it.

619
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,080
It's not like you don't know.

620
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm not used to strangers.

621
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,560
You're not used to strangers.

622
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,200
Treat everyone as an enemy.

623
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
I was wrong.

624
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,160
Having dinner

625
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,600
Manager Wang is here.

626
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,360
Please have a seat.

627
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,240
Mr. Huo is waiting for you.

628
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,720
President Huo.

629
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,520
I heard from Meng Teisuke.

630
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,920
You want to take Ming Xiao Xiao

631
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,720
To this building.

632
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
For the villa.

633
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,000
Xiao Xiao, right?

634
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,040
She's special.

635
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,040
she

636
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,480
Your ideas are simpler than ordinary people.

637
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,560
And reacts slowly.

638
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,520
If she offended you in any way,

639
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,560
I hope that

640
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,520
Your Excellency, there are plenty of them.

641
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,800
Don't be angry.

642
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,080
If you have any dissatisfaction,

643
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,160
You can tell me at any time.

644
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,920
I'll teach her.

645
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,920
What did Manager Wang say?

646
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,280
as if

647
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,720
I'm a bully.

648
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,840
As a bad girl.

649
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,800
Nothing.

650
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't dare.

651
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,800
I specially asked you here today.

652
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,920
Actually, I think

653
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
Ming Xiao Xiao is very capable.

654
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
So I hope she can

655
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Take care of my side.

656
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,320
You can be at your beck and call.

657
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
You can do whatever you want.

658
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,560
That's enough.

659
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,360
What is this?

660
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,920
MingXiaoxiao

661
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,440
Whether you're stupid or pretending to be stupid,

662
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,360
Come to me.

663
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Your life will be over.

664
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,360
Miss Lin,

665
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
You came to rest at the resort.

666
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,920
What's wrong?

667
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,240
Meng Te, help me.

668
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
There are so many problems.

669
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
I didn't even know

670
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Which one did you answer?

671
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,520
not as good as

672
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Let's go inside and talk about it.

673
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,400
Sorry, Miss Lin.

674
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,760
Private houses can't be broken into.

675
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,280
I'm looking for President Huo.

676
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,480
Miss Lin is joking.

677
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,360
Mr. Huo is a busy man.

678
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,040
How could you stay here every day?

679
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,320
Meng Tezhu is really dedicated.

680
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
President Huo is not here.

681
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,360
Why are you holding so many files?

682
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,840
To yourself.

683
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,560
Sorry, Miss Lin.

684
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm here today.

685
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,280
You won't be able to get in.

686
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,320
What if I insist?

687
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Meng Guo.

688
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Please come in.

689
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,040
Miss Lin, please.

690
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,880
Meng Tezhu.

691
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,560
You're a smart man.

692
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,240
Take a long-term view.

693
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
Don't stop me from seeing President Huo.

694
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,360
maybe

695
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,120
You have to change your mind.

696
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
She called me Mrs. Huo.

697
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,480
Good luck.

698
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,720
There are many people who want to be Mrs. Huo.

699
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,880
What makes you think

700
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,480
Are you qualified for Mrs. Huo?

701
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,280
The Lin Group is still valuable.

702
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm Mrs. Huo.

703
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,840
Its absolute controlling interest.

704
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,880
It's a dowry.

705
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,960
Miss Lin,

706
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm afraid that you're not interested

707
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,880
The current dilemma

708
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,760
And survived.

709
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,040
To tell you the truth,

710
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,760
As long as I want,

711
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,160
Huo's family.

712
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,280
Any time.

713
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,600
To buy the Lin family.

714
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,720
What if I say,

715
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,080
Huo Feng Lei also

716
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,360
The same condition?

717
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,560
President Huo.

718
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,960
I have a file.

719
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,000
You may take a look.

720
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,800
What do you mean?

721
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,280
Take a fake file.

722
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,200
And wanted to threaten me.

723
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,640
My health is good or bad.

724
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,680
I guess you can see it clearly.

725
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,640
Since I came in,

726
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,240
Mr. Huo's posture

727
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
But he hasn't changed a bit.

728
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,680
Your physical condition

729
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,760
How about this?

730
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,640
You know?

731
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,760
I know.

732
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,200
But President Huo

733
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
You still misunderstood me.

734
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,720
If I want to,

735
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
To threaten you,

736
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
This document will appear on

737
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,480
Huo Fenglei's hands

738
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Instead of what we have now.

739
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,080
At the negotiating table,

740
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,760
Huo Yunting

741
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,560
You need me.

742
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,040
and

743
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
The Huo family's company

744
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,320
I also need one.

745
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,760
That Mrs. Huo can handle.

746
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,600
Miss Lin,

747
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,600
I think you probably

748
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,560
You still don't know much about me.

749
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm

750
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,800
She was heartless.

751
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,680
Now it's...

752
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,520
The leader of the Huo family.

753
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
That's even more outrageous.

754
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,040
You're the only child in the Lin family.

755
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,000
Stay away from me.

756
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,320
Don't worry about Mr. Lin.

757
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,520
Meng Guo.

758
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,640
to see a visitor out

759
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,040
Please, Miss Lin.

760
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,720
President Huo.

761
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,960
I think

762
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,760
Is frank enough.

763
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
I hope you can think about it.

764
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:52,880
Of course

765
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Even if you don't agree,

766
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,040
I will also destroy

767
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
This medical report

768
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,720
Keep it a secret from you.

769
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,200
Miss Lin,

770
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,240
I always think

771
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,680
A family or a business.

772
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
If I end up

773
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,800
To exchange marriage for marriage.

774
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
Peace and resources

775
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,120
that

776
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,440
It is not necessary to be saved.

777
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,000
My opinion.

778
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,680
To share it with you.

779
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,600
Boss, stay in the sun for a while.

780
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,320
It's good for your health.

781
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
Your phone ringtone has been ringing

782
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,880
It's not broken.

783
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,240
Who is it?

784
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Looking for you.

785
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,480
My foster mother.

786
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,720
She had a stroke in her hometown two days ago.

787
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
I've paid enough.

788
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,840
And hired a minder.

789
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,920
But she still asked the hospital

790
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,880
To urge me every day.

791
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
I don't know what I'm urging.

792
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,880
That...

793
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,520
Your foster mother who abused you as a child.

794
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
It's really hard for Meng Tezhu.

795
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,280
You have to take care of them everywhere.

796
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
A half-dead person.

797
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,760
That's enough.

798
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,640
I'll give you a week off.

799
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,040
Hurry up.

800
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,920
Deal with the trifles.

801
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,960
But I'm leaving.

802
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,440
What about you?

803
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,160
Xiaoxiao

804
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,080
Brother Meng.

805
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,440
I've eaten so many cupcakes.

806
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,960
Can I go to work now?

807
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,720
It's not important now.

808
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,720
Xiaoxiao

809
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm very sincere now.

810
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,640
To invite you again.

811
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,440
Keep an eye on Mr. Huo.

812
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,000
I hope you can think about it.

813
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,440
but

814
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
I have many more.

815
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
To do other work.

816
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,400
and

817
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,280
Mr. Huo,

818
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,360
Don't be naughty.

819
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,080
After I leave,

820
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,040
He listens to you.

821
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,120
Besides, Mr. Huo,

822
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
He's a patient.

823
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,680
So you have to let him

824
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,600
but

825
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,960
He doesn't like me.

826
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,760
Trust me.

827
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,200
President Huo will like you.

828
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,720
to wait a moment

829
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,000
I know.

830
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,240
After three days,

831
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
I'll go to the hospital when I land.

832
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,040
Alright

833
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,800
That's it.

834
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,600
Xiaoxiao

835
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,720
As you can see,

836
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm leaving soon.

837
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,840
Mr. Huo is alone.

838
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,880
And limping.

839
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,200
If you don't take care of him,

840
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,640
Will be pitiful.

841
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,480
that

842
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,600
Alright then.

843
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,840
However

844
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,120
Really?

845
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
For three months.

846
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,320
So many bonuses?

847
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,640
Of course.

848
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,440
If you do well,

849
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,880
There will be a bonus.

850
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:24,880
good

851
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,200
Xiao Xiao never lies.

852
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,600
I'll definitely do that.

853
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,800
I believe in you.

854
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,120
Xiaoxiao

855
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,640
Mr. Huo's movement is inconvenient.

856
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,160
So work hard.

857
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960
To take care of him.

858
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,040
All the food and clothing.

859
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:38,920
How about this?

860
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Although you will work hard,

861
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,000
But Mr. Huo's body

862
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,600
I refuse.

863
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,920
I can accept that.

864
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,280
A fool will be the cleaner.

865
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,280
But I can't.

866
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,480
At the mercy of a fool.

867
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm not stupid.

868
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,680
I was just slow.

869
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,400
Well

870
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
I will work hard.

871
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,360
and

872
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
You're limping.

873
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,440
I didn't hate you.

874
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,160
yes

875
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,560
You're not stupid.

876
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,520
I'm stupid.

877
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,120
That's why I asked you

878
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,280
You're here to irritate me every day.

879
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,080
See?

880
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,360
Mr. Huo is in poor health.

881
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,040
So he has a bad temper.

882
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,240
What if?

883
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,760
If he's angry,

884
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,800
Just call me.

885
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,000
Or what?

886
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,080
You can hide.

887
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,040
What is the guarantee?

888
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,080
He doesn't hurt himself.

889
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,240
Just live.

890
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,480
I know.

891
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,200
alive

892
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,000
alive

893
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,240
Brother Long Feng,

894
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,240
You finally called me back.

895
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,960
Luckily, I learned to use WeChat.

896
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,280
I can see you now.

897
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Sorry, Xiao Xiao.

898
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,960
I've been too busy recently.

899
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,680
and

900
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,040
I didn't expect that

901
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,200
My mom will come to check on me suddenly.

902
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,000
I didn't accompany you.

903
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm really sorry.

904
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,520
Xiao Xiao,

905
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,480
You're really a miser.

906
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Remember,

907
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,520
I've been working hard with you.

908
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,200
Correct!

909
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,040
When we meet next time,

910
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,240
I have a little surprise for you.

911
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,440
Well

912
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,720
Xiao Feng.

913
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,400
Who are you talking to?

914
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,920
Is that fool Ming Xiao Xiao?

915
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,520
How many times have I told you?

916
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,320
Don't contact her.

917
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,960
mom

918
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,080
Stop it.

919
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,560
Why didn't you listen?

920
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,720
You want to piss me off?

921
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,480
Fool

922
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,960
You were tricked.

923
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,520
For such a wild man,

924
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,680
It's not worth it.

925
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,840
Brother Long Feng won't lie to me.

926
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,560
It's his mother.
