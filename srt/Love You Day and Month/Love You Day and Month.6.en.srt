1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Huo Yunting

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,920
Wait for me.

3
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Boss

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,560
Is this revenge?

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,840
Everything has just begun.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm waiting to see

7
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
The day they went to hell,

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,600
By the way, Meng Guo,

9
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Get me James.

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,080
As soon as possible.

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,280
A comprehensive pre-treatment physical examination

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,080
For a physical examination.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,040
treatment

14
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,080
Boss

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,440
you

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,280
You want to open it?

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,600
What's the fuss about?

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
I've almost recovered.

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
I just want to have a physical examination.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,480
Instead of being kidnapped by Ming Xiao,

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,920
Why don't I go on my own?

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
The power of love is great.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,880
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
What? Am I wrong, boss?

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
Between you and Xiao Xiao,

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,720
is or isn't

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
Are you right?

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,160
And then I hit you.

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,600
Alright.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,240
I won't talk about it.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,400
Stop it, alright?

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,520
You're too late.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,040
Huo Yunting's entire internal organs

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
Is very weak.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
Even with my treatment,

36
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,240
There is only a 5% chance of success.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
But if it doesn't work,

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
Three months at the most.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,040
Three months.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,600
Boss

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,360
It's much better than I expected.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,560
It's shorter.

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,320
Why did you come back alone?

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,600
I thought we agreed.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,720
Are you having a physical today? Do you need treatment?

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,800
Meng Guo.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,040
Stop hiding it from me.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,160
If you and James

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,760
I heard everything.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Three months.

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,200
Right?

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,720
Boss

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,400
Don't be like this.

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Actually, Doctor James

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,000
You might not be right.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,440
Your physical condition

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,920
It can't be that bad.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,080
even if

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,840
It's really bad.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
There are many

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,320
The top medical experts.

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,080
And traditional Chinese medicine.

63
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,760
Doctor.

64
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,280
In our ancient culture,

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,040
There must be magic medicine.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,760
It can cure your illness.

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,320
Please.

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't be discouraged.

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Do you think shooting a TV series

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Give it back.

71
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
It doesn't matter if there's no magic medicine.

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Didn't he say that

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Is there a 5% chance of cure?

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
It's only 1%.

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,840
Let's give it a try.

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Meng Guo.

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
I have only a few days to live.

78
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
Don't bother anymore.

79
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Also

80
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
You have to promise me.

81
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,200
This matter

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,880
In any case

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
You mustn't tell Xiao Xiao.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,680
She will be sad.

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,200
God

86
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,040
Thank you for putting Ming Xiao Xiao

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
To my side.

88
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
My short life

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
It's not a waste of time.

90
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,280
Boss

91
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,880
Xiaoxiao

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Are you hurt?

93
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Why are you so careless?

94
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,400
You look absent-minded.

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm fine.

96
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,360
just

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,200
Manager Wang called.

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
And asked me when

99
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
Go back to work.

100
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,720
I've been thinking about this.

101
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
So I was distracted.

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Is Xiao Xiao leaving?

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,040
Also good

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,280
It's meaningless to stay.

105
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,720
Sorry.

106
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,400
I forgot.

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
The contract with Manager Wang

108
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,880
Is only signed for this weekend.

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,360
Xiaoxiao

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,760
What are you thinking?

111
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,960
To stay.

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,600
still

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,560
Go back.

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
The home is good.

115
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,880
The dorm is also good.

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,440
I feel weird.

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
This problem is too complicated.

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
I don't know how to choose.

119
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
If you hesitate,

120
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,520
Then I'd better go back.

121
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,720
That's you.

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,880
To get used to life.

123
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,400
I have friends.

124
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,200
There's a colleague.

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,880
It's not like this.

126
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,240
Lonely and cold.

127
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
boring

128
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,760
Brother Meng.

129
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Didn't you go to see a doctor?

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,160
Mr. Huo,

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
What's wrong?

132
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,520
Was he scolded by the doctor?

133
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,240
Xiaoxiao

134
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Maybe you don't understand.

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
I really hope that medicine

136
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,000
And believe in miracles.

137
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Just like Mr. Huo believed in you.

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,760
Meng Guo.

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,120
Meng Guo.

140
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm going to the bathroom.

141
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,200
Come and help me.

142
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother Meng's mother just

143
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
I've been calling.

144
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,080
So he just

145
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,960
I'm leaving in a hurry.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,720
However

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
He has told me

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,120
You want me?

149
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,280
I watched you wash.

150
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,000
Mr. Huo,

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,680
Do you want to take a shower?

152
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,760
I just put the bath water in.

153
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,000
Be prepared at all times.

154
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,120
Idiot

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Don't you understand?

156
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
I'd better go by myself.

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,080
may not

158
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
You're weak now.

159
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,400
What if it's inside?

160
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
What if I slip?

161
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,640
Don't worry.

162
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
I gave it to the owner.

163
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
Babies and dogs.

164
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,840
You've bathed.

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,840
Very experienced.

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,240
You're weak.

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
You're sweating so much.

168
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,520
How could I?

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,960
To take a shower alone.

170
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,200
MingXiaoxiao

171
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,080
Whether you really don't understand or not,

172
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
If you don't choose me,

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
Don't come any closer to me.

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,440
but

175
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
I didn't...

176
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,360
Way

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,720
No

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
To get close to you.

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,760
Mr. Huo,

180
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,680
Am I...

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,520
It's stupid.

182
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
I don't know.

183
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,080
What should I do?

184
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
That's right.

185
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
And chose you.

186
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,640
What about

187
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,160
Is it comfortable?

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Listen to me.

189
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,360
That's right.

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,280
Well

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,240
In the future,

192
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,240
It's up to you.

193
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,640
But Xiao Xiao,

194
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,440
I still want to ask you.

195
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,800
today

196
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,520
Why don't you choose to stay?

197
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,160
It's too hard to make a choice.

198
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
I'm slow.

199
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Actually, you don't have to

200
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
To think about how to choose.

201
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
You just have to imagine

202
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
If Fen Fen and I

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
And fell into the sea.

204
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Who would you save first?

205
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,920
you

206
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
Why did you fall into the sea?

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,600
I mean if...

208
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,360
For example,

209
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,840
but

210
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,440
I can't swim.

211
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,600
How to save you?

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
What if you can?

213
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,880
if

214
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,440
You fell into the water.

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,440
if

216
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,000
I can swim.

217
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,120
if

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm going to save you.

219
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,640
It's too complicated.

220
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
My brain is going to explode.

221
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,320
Don't wash it.

222
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,880
Clean up yourself.

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
MingXiaoxiao

224
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,520
What about the gold service?

225
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,360
You little fool.

226
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,560
The way I am now,

227
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,160
I would rather you

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Don't choose me.

229
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,280
Since Miss Zhao is here,

230
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,640
You might as well stay for two more days.

231
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,360
And see the scenery.

232
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,480
You can also be with Xiao Xiao.

233
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Let's talk about old times.

234
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm over here.

235
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,000
And a few empty villas.

236
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,120
Take your pick.

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,120
President Huo.

238
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
I specially picked Xiao Xiao.

239
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
When he was away.

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,960
You don't have to

241
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,080
Give me these empty ones.

242
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,840
Mr. Zhao, are you

243
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,560
The welfare center is watching.

244
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,400
Xiao Xiao grew up.

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
She's half a family.

246
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Why is she doing well now?

247
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
Instead, you look unhappy.

248
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Because I'm Xiao's relative,

249
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
So I have to

250
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,920
To see you in person.

251
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,720
President Huo.

252
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,560
Run a welfare home.

253
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,160
Is not easy.

254
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Have I seen too many?

255
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,880
With a sense of morality.

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
I also know that

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
The so-called upper class rich people

258
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,480
There are many eccentricities.

259
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,360
but

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,400
Please let Ming Xiao go.

261
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
Miss Zhao said that.

262
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
But it's not reasonable.

263
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
If you mean Xiao Xiao,

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,800
Working here,

265
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Then we're all acting

266
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,760
Contract work.

267
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,760
Xiao Xiao did a good job.

268
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
At least I won't be hurt

269
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
I was encouraged to run away.

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
if

271
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
You want to accuse me of

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
Xiaoxiao's relationship

273
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
The age-appropriate men and women are in love with each other.

275
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Even if you are her family,

276
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,280
I don't have the position to hurt you.

277
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,360
Xiao Xiao is a special person.

278
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,040
The children in the school.

279
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,920
How could it be

280
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,680
to be harmonious

281
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,560
first

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
I've never sent Ming Xiao

283
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
As a special group of people.

284
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
I like her.

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,080
Respect her.

286
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,680
Willing and willing.

287
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,280
And wait for her to respond.

288
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
If she doesn't choose me,

289
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,200
I will let go.

290
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,320
second

291
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
Miss Zhao, you're her teacher.

292
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
And claimed to be her relative.

293
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,520
Don't you know that

294
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Living alone,

295
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
Will you be bullied?

296
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,680
Miss Zhao.

297
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,240
You can do whatever you want.

298
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,280
Say something nice.

299
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
And left.

300
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
But I can see

301
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,600
She was bullied and cheated.

302
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,440
you

303
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,400
You're being unreasonable.

304
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
My Xiao Xiao.

305
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
She just reacted slowly.

306
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,320
Is not a senseless fool.

307
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,760
She will love.

308
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,920
And get hurt.

309
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,280
These ones here

310
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,640
You can manage it.

311
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Her whole life?

312
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,120
I can't help it.

313
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
But Mr. Huo

314
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,040
Whether you admit it or not,

315
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Xiao Xiao loves you now.

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,280
And your imaginary love.

317
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,640
It's not the same thing at all.

318
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,960
Xiao Xiao is

319
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Good and kind.

320
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,080
Cat and cat, ant and snail.

321
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,160
She likes them all.

322
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,000
I wish you

323
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,080
After the ant snail,

324
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
And get the number.

325
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Ant snail

326
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
What's the big deal?

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
Are all equally short-lived.

328
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,800
Xiaoxiao

329
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,040
Xiaoxiao

330
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,160
Xiaoxiao

331
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,280
Brother Long Feng,

332
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,120
I haven't seen you for a long time.

333
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,280
This is my gift to you.

334
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,160
I wanted to save money,

335
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,240
To give you a new phone.

336
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,480
But I really want to

337
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,280
I saw you earlier.

338
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,240
therefore

339
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,440
I didn't save enough money.

340
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,480
I have to buy you

341
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
The new piggy bank.

342
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,280
I hope you like it.

343
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,200
It's okay.

344
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,200
Brother Long Feng,

345
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
What gift?

346
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,560
I like them all.

347
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,760
As long as you like it,

348
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,600
What do you want me to do?

349
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm willing to.

350
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,880
Xiao Xiao doesn't need anything.

351
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
This crazy brother

352
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
You're welcome.

353
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,240
he

354
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,440
He's the one

355
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,360
The wealthy owner

356
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,040
Huo Yunting

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,760
President Huo.

358
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,400
hand

359
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,280
Mr. Huo,

360
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
This is Brother Long Feng.

361
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
He came to see me.

362
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's have a chat.

363
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,680
What?

364
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,640
What a mess.

365
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Take them home.

366
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,240
I don't like meeting strangers.

367
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh

368
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,160
Sure enough

369
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
The so-called rich man

370
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,280
That's the face.

371
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,600
Xiaoxiao

372
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,720
This time,

373
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,880
To pick you up.

374
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,400
You can talk to me.

375
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,920
And live together.

376
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,480
Let's go.

377
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Let go of her!

378
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
You're a little girl.

379
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,320
Learn to hate the rich first.

380
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,440
Get out of here.

381
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,760
Brother Long Feng,

382
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,760
I

383
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm working.

384
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,600
Or

385
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,400
you

386
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,200
Go back first.

387
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,160
Xiaoxiao

388
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,560
Xiaoxiao

389
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,280
Xiaoxiao

390
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,800
Don't be afraid.

391
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,760
You work first.

392
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,720
Do you remember

393
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,480
You promised me.

394
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,640
When I grew up,

395
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,560
As my girlfriend?

396
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
I will always wait for you.

397
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,880
So many stars.

398
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
What a big moon.

399
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,080
Mr. Huo,

400
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,040
Look.

401
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,360
It's so beautiful.

402
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Xiaoxiao

403
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,080
Before,

404
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,120
I really promised to do it.

405
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
Long Feng's girlfriend.

406
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,400
Are you in love with him?

407
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,680
girlfriend

408
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,080
yes

409
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,880
What is it?

410
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,960
yes

411
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,480
A kind of good friend?

412
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,920
that

413
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
I should be...

414
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,520
Promised Brother Long Feng.

415
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,320
but

416
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,440
But in a relationship,

417
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,320
I don't quite understand.

418
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
You little fool.

419
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
I know you don't understand.

420
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Xiao Xiao, look.

421
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,080
There are so many places in the sky.

422
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,880
Beautiful stars.

423
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,640
You like them all.

424
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,840
but

425
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,600
What about them?

426
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,520
Can only be

427
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
As a friend.

428
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,120
Can we be in love?

429
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,840
But different.

430
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,160
In love.

431
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
Like the moon.

432
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,600
The moon is the brightest.

433
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
Is also unique.

434
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,640
So your love

435
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,720
Can only be given to one person.

436
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,640
I can only do that.

437
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,640
The girlfriend of my favorite person.

438
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,000
There are many stars.

439
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,080
But the moon only has one.

440
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,280
therefore

441
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,920
In my heart,

442
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,960
Mr. Huo is the only one.

443
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,880
Mr. Huo,

444
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,640
Is my moon.

445
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,200
I can only talk to Mr. Huo.

446
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
Are you in a relationship?

447
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,560
Xiao Xiao is my sun.

448
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,120
Is also my moon.

449
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,960
Will always be unique.

450
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
forever

451
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,840
Most precious.

452
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,040
Look at the meteor.

453
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,120
Meteor, meteor.

454
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Please allow Ming Xiaoxiao.

455
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,320
I always like Huo Yunting.

456
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,120
Xiaoxiao

457
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,480
alive

458
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,520
Maybe it's hard.

459
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,960
But I can look at the stars with you.

460
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,560
Is the world's

461
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
The most beautiful thing.

462
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Sorry, President Huo.

463
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
I didn't expect you to come suddenly.

464
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,240
I didn't prepare anything to serve.

465
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,600
this

466
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,480
Mr. Long Feng

467
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,160
It's a new move of our company.

468
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,960
Longfeng

469
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,960
Xiao Xiao promised you before.

470
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
It's just a joke,

471
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,560
But after all,

472
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,480
We're adults.

473
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,960
Since it's a joke,

474
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,040
You should explain it clearly.

475
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,160
So that some people

476
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,120
Are you serious?

477
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,520
Brother Long Feng,

478
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,960
sorry

479
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,920
I can't be with you anymore.

480
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,720
Are you in a relationship?

481
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,480
I

482
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,120
I already know

483
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
What it means to be in love.

484
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,640
In love.

485
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
And good friends.

486
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,760
yes

487
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,040
It's different.

488
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
So in the future,

489
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,040
I can only

490
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,320
Mr. Huo is in a relationship.

491
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,480
Xiaoxiao

492
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,640
Were you killed by Huo Yunting

493
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,320
And threatened her.

494
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:19,880
still

495
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,040
What is he taking?

496
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,600
I lied to you.

497
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,880
let go

498
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm not like you.

499
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040
Won't take a small gift.

500
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,400
You lied to a girl to be in a relationship.

501
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,680
moreover

502
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,520
Xiao Xiao

503
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,920
You can have whatever you want.

504
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
I don't need your small profit.

505
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
If Mr. Long

506
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,840
And can behave himself.

507
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,920
And be a good brother.

508
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Xiao Xiao and I

509
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,760
Will thank you.

510
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,840
Huo Yunting

511
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,640
You're so mean.

512
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,760
Longfeng

513
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,920
Don't touch me.

514
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,320
What's going on?

515
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,600
everyone

516
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,760
is or isn't

517
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,640
What's the misunderstanding?

518
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Longfeng

519
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,120
Yes?

520
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,640
Xiao Xiao,

521
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Was your girlfriend?

522
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,800
Miss Lin,

523
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
I've seen many wonderful performances.

524
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,080
And your acting

525
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,040
To be slightly inferior.

526
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,200
Want to come

527
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
If Lang Feng hasn't been

528
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,280
Who grew up with Xiao Xiao.

529
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
You wouldn't hire him.

530
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,720
And brought him in.

531
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,520
The resort is here.

532
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,360
That's it.

533
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,200
That's all I need to say.

534
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,880
Xiaoxiao

535
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:32,960
Let's go.

536
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,520
Correct!

537
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
Huo's acquisition of Lin's family

538
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,200
The final contract.

539
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,000
I haven't signed it yet.

540
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,560
Miss Lin,

541
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,680
If you still want it,

542
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,840
What tricks,

543
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,600
You must be careful.

544
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,520
Be careful.

545
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,840
So that you can be caught.

546
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,280
It's really embarrassing.

547
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:51,880
President Huo.

548
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,520
Mr. Huo, listen to my explanation.

549
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,640
Cheers!

550
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,080
To freedom.

551
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
To the lovelorn.

552
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,400
drink

553
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,960
Is it because

554
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
Did Ming Xiao refuse?

555
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,160
Is that necessary?

556
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,040
Don't think about how to get back.

557
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
I knew that I would abandon myself here.

558
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,560
useless

559
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,240
Miss Lin,

560
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,680
You have exposed your true nature.

561
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,320
When you need me,

562
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,600
You are so courteous.

563
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
Now I'm useless.

564
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,480
He abandoned me.

565
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
You are the same as Xiao Xiao.

566
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,200
bad

567
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Actually, you don't have to

568
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,120
To think about how to choose.

569
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,880
You just have to imagine

570
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
If Fen Fen and I

571
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
And fell into the sea.

572
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,600
Who would you save first?

573
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,440
you

574
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Why did you fall into the sea?

575
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
I mean if...

576
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,880
For example,

577
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,360
but

578
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
I can't swim.

579
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,120
How to save you?

580
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,520
What if you can?

581
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,400
if

582
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
You fell into the water.

583
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,960
if

584
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
I can swim.

585
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,640
if

586
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm going to save you.

587
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,160
It's too complicated.

588
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,520
My brain is going to explode.

589
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,840
Don't wash it.

590
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,400
Clean up yourself.

591
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,160
MingXiaoxiao

592
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,040
What about the gold service?

593
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,880
You little fool.

594
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,080
The way I am now,

595
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,680
I would rather you

596
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Don't choose me.

597
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
Since Miss Zhao is here,

598
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,160
You might as well stay for two more days.

599
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
And see the scenery.

600
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,000
You can also be with Xiao Xiao.

601
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Let's talk about old times.

602
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,320
I'm over here.

603
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,520
And a few empty villas.

604
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,640
Take your pick.

605
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,640
President Huo.

606
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I specially picked Xiao Xiao.

607
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
When he was away.

608
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,480
You don't have to

609
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,600
Give me these empty ones.

610
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,360
Mr. Zhao, are you

611
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,080
The welfare center is watching.

612
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,920
Xiao Xiao grew up.

613
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
She's half a family.

614
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,600
Why is she doing well now?

615
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,360
Instead, you look unhappy.

616
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,520
Because I'm Xiao's relative,

617
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,080
So I have to

618
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,440
To see you in person.

619
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,240
President Huo.

620
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,080
Run a welfare home.

621
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,680
Is not easy.

622
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,560
Have I seen too many?

623
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,400
With a sense of morality.

624
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,240
I also know that

625
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,120
The so-called upper class rich people

626
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,000
There are many eccentricities.

627
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,880
but

628
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,920
Please let Ming Xiao go.

629
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
Miss Zhao said that.

630
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,200
But it's not reasonable.

631
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,400
If you mean Xiao Xiao,

632
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
Working here,

633
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,560
Then we're all acting

634
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,280
Contract work.

635
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,280
Xiao Xiao did a good job.

636
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
At least I won't be hurt

637
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,680
I was encouraged to run away.

638
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,840
if

639
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,960
You want to accuse me of

640
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,080
Xiaoxiao's relationship

641
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,160
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
The age-appropriate men and women are in love with each other.

643
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
Even if you are her family,

644
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,800
I don't have the position to hurt you.

645
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,880
Xiao Xiao is a special person.

646
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,560
The children in the school.

647
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,440
How could it be

648
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,200
to be harmonious

649
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,080
first

650
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
I've never sent Ming Xiao

651
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,240
As a special group of people.

652
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
I like her.

653
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,600
Respect her.

654
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,200
Willing and willing.

655
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,800
And wait for her to respond.

656
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,800
If she doesn't choose me,

657
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,720
I will let go.

658
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:58,840
second

659
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,840
Miss Zhao, you're her teacher.

660
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,720
And claimed to be her relative.

661
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,040
Don't you know that

662
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,240
Living alone,

663
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Will you be bullied?

664
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,200
Miss Zhao.

665
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,760
You can do whatever you want.

666
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
Say something nice.

667
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,200
And left.

668
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,600
But I can see

669
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,120
She was bullied and cheated.

670
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:15,960
you

671
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,920
You're being unreasonable.

672
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,960
My Xiao Xiao.

673
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,360
She just reacted slowly.

674
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,840
Is not a senseless fool.

675
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,280
She will love.

676
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,440
And get hurt.

677
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,800
These ones here

678
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,160
You can manage it.

679
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,960
Her whole life?

680
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,640
I can't help it.

681
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,680
But Mr. Huo

682
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,560
Whether you admit it or not,

683
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,120
Xiao Xiao loves you now.

684
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,800
And your imaginary love.

685
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,160
It's not the same thing at all.

686
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,480
Xiao Xiao is

687
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Good and kind.

688
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,600
Cat and cat, ant and snail.

689
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,680
She likes them all.

690
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,520
I wish you

691
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,600
After the ant snail,

692
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
And get the number.

693
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Ant snail

694
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,920
What's the big deal?

695
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,800
Are all equally short-lived.

696
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,320
Xiaoxiao

697
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,560
Xiaoxiao

698
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,680
Xiaoxiao

699
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Brother Long Feng,

700
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,640
I haven't seen you for a long time.

701
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,800
This is my gift to you.

702
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,680
I wanted to save money,

703
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,760
To give you a new phone.

704
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,000
But I really want to

705
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,800
I saw you earlier.

706
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,760
therefore

707
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,960
I didn't save enough money.

708
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,000
I have to buy you

709
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The new piggy bank.

710
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,800
I hope you like it.

711
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,720
It's okay.

712
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,720
Brother Long Feng,

713
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,120
What gift?

714
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,080
I like them all.

715
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,280
As long as you like it,

716
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,120
What do you want me to do?

717
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,560
I'm willing to.

718
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,400
Xiao Xiao doesn't need anything.

719
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
This crazy brother

720
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
You're welcome.

721
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,760
he

722
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,960
He's the one

723
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,880
The wealthy owner

724
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,560
Huo Yunting

725
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,280
President Huo.

726
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:58,920
hand

727
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Mr. Huo,

728
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,000
This is Brother Long Feng.

729
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,440
He came to see me.

730
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,880
Let's have a chat.

731
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,200
What?

732
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,160
What a mess.

733
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,960
Take them home.

734
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,760
I don't like meeting strangers.

735
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,240
Oh

736
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,680
Sure enough

737
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
The so-called rich man

738
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,800
That's the face.

739
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,120
Xiaoxiao

740
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,240
This time,

741
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,400
To pick you up.

742
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:24,920
You can talk to me.

743
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,440
And live together.

744
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,000
Let's go.

745
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,320
Let go of her!

746
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
You're a little girl.

747
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,840
Learn to hate the rich first.

748
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Get out of here.

749
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,280
Brother Long Feng,

750
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,280
I

751
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,400
I'm working.

752
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,120
Or

753
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:36,920
you

754
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,720
Go back first.

755
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,680
Xiaoxiao

756
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,080
Xiaoxiao

757
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,800
Xiaoxiao

758
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,320
Don't be afraid.

759
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,280
You work first.

760
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,240
Do you remember

761
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,000
You promised me.

762
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,160
When I grew up,

763
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,080
As my girlfriend?

764
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,480
I will always wait for you.

765
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,400
So many stars.

766
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
What a big moon.

767
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,600
Mr. Huo,

768
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,560
Look.

769
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,880
It's so beautiful.

770
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,240
Xiaoxiao

771
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,600
Before,

772
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,640
I really promised to do it.

773
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,560
Long Feng's girlfriend.

774
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,920
Are you in love with him?

775
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,200
girlfriend

776
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,600
yes

777
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,400
What is it?

778
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,480
yes

779
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
A kind of good friend?

780
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,440
that

781
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,440
I should be...

782
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,040
Promised Brother Long Feng.

783
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:27,840
but

784
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,960
But in a relationship,

785
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,840
I don't quite understand.

786
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,680
You little fool.

787
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,320
I know you don't understand.

788
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,280
Xiao Xiao, look.

789
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,600
There are so many places in the sky.

790
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,400
Beautiful stars.

791
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,160
You like them all.

792
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,360
but

793
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,120
What about them?

794
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,040
Can only be

795
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,440
As a friend.

796
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,640
Can we be in love?

797
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,360
But different.

798
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,680
In love.

799
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,560
Like the moon.

800
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,120
The moon is the brightest.

801
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,760
Is also unique.

802
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,160
So your love

803
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,240
Can only be given to one person.

804
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,160
I can only do that.

805
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,160
The girlfriend of my favorite person.

806
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,520
There are many stars.

807
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,600
But the moon only has one.

808
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,800
therefore

809
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,440
In my heart,

810
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,480
Mr. Huo is the only one.

811
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,400
Mr. Huo,

812
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,160
Is my moon.

813
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,720
I can only talk to Mr. Huo.

814
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,400
Are you in a relationship?

815
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,080
Xiao Xiao is my sun.

816
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,640
Is also my moon.

817
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,480
Will always be unique.

818
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,480
forever

819
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,360
Most precious.

820
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,560
Look at the meteor.

821
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,640
Meteor, meteor.

822
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,040
Please allow Ming Xiaoxiao.

823
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
I always like Huo Yunting.

824
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,640
Xiaoxiao

825
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,000
alive

826
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,040
Maybe it's hard.

827
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,480
But I can look at the stars with you.

828
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,080
Is the world's

829
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,520
The most beautiful thing.

830
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,720
Sorry, President Huo.

831
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,920
I didn't expect you to come suddenly.

832
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,760
I didn't prepare anything to serve.

833
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,120
this

834
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,000
Mr. Long Feng

835
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,680
It's a new move of our company.

836
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,480
Longfeng

837
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,480
Xiao Xiao promised you before.

838
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,960
It's just a joke,

839
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,080
But after all,

840
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,000
We're adults.

841
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,480
Since it's a joke,

842
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,560
You should explain it clearly.

843
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,680
So that some people

844
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,640
Are you serious?

845
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,040
Brother Long Feng,

846
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,480
sorry

847
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,440
I can't be with you anymore.

848
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,240
Are you in a relationship?

849
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,000
I

850
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,640
I already know

851
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,360
What it means to be in love.

852
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,160
In love.

853
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,000
And good friends.

854
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,280
yes

855
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,560
It's different.

856
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,560
So in the future,

857
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,560
I can only

858
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,840
Mr. Huo is in a relationship.

859
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Xiaoxiao

860
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,160
Were you killed by Huo Yunting

861
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,840
And threatened her.

862
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,400
still

863
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,560
What is he taking?

864
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,120
I lied to you.

865
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,400
let go

866
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,280
I'm not like you.

867
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,560
Won't take a small gift.

868
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,920
You lied to a girl to be in a relationship.

869
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,200
moreover

870
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,040
Xiao Xiao

871
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,440
You can have whatever you want.

872
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,280
I don't need your small profit.

873
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,600
If Mr. Long

874
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,360
And can behave himself.

875
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,440
And be a good brother.

876
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,240
Xiao Xiao and I

877
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,280
Will thank you.

878
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,360
Huo Yunting

879
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,160
You're so mean.

880
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,280
Longfeng

881
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,440
Don't touch me.

882
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,840
What's going on?

883
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,120
everyone

884
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,280
is or isn't

885
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,160
What's the misunderstanding?

886
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,560
Longfeng

887
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,640
Yes?

888
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,160
Xiao Xiao,

889
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,920
Was your girlfriend?

890
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,320
Miss Lin,

891
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,920
I've seen many wonderful performances.

892
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,600
And your acting

893
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,560
To be slightly inferior.

894
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,720
Want to come

895
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,200
If Lang Feng hasn't been

896
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,800
Who grew up with Xiao Xiao.

897
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,440
You wouldn't hire him.

898
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,240
And brought him in.

899
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,040
The resort is here.

900
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:05,880
That's it.

901
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,720
That's all I need to say.

902
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Xiaoxiao

903
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,480
Let's go.
