1
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,440
When you treat people

2
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,600
It's great.

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,280
And then,

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Very bad.

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,520
Don't understand.

6
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,880
That's who I am.

7
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
You can't stand it. Let's go.

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,720
You are pretending to be kind.

9
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
It's good to have them all gone.

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,960
good

11
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Don't be angry.

12
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm not.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,960
Mr. Huo,

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,640
We

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,640
Don't keep your distance.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Sit back.

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't hurt your leg again.

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
Why are your feet so cold?

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,440
I said no.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Come out and blow the air.

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,640
Will it be warmer?

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
You little fool.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
You're inconsiderate to others.

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,960
Be careful which day

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
People don't even know it.

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,160
What?

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
We're not going to the beach.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,720
I'll take you to another place.

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Mr. Huo, you're right.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,320
The scenery here

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
It's so beautiful.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:49,840
Look.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,960
That's me.

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
I always told you.

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
Stray cat litter.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Wait a moment.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
We can build a cat house together.

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,280
It's very interesting.

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,760
naive

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
There's a waste of time.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Just buy one.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,960
You don't understand.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,680
A nest of my own.

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,760
Is home?

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Stray cats.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,040
I really like my home.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
It's no worse than online shopping.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
Your cat is really happy.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,040
And a home.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have it too?

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,920
The Second Division.

52
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
In the whole park.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
The most beautiful house in the world.

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,120
Big house.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Is not necessarily home.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,400
It's okay.

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,440
As long as you

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,640
No more tantrums.

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,360
You can live here.

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,640
My home

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
home

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,360
I can have a home.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
It's Ming Xiao Xiao.

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,560
Together?

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,120
that

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Thank you for letting me stay.

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,760
you're welcome

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,080
MingXiaoxiao

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,320
You ran too fast.

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,000
Wait for me.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,440
MingXiaoxiao

72
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
You're really lucky.

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
With such a thick thigh,

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,680
but

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
As long as I'm Liu Yufen,

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
You're still here.

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,720
It's not your turn to stand out.

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,040
Mgjmgtmgj

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,800
Manager

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,840
Just take it.

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,280
Mr. Huo is so fierce.

82
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
She went crazy yesterday.

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
You had to fire me.

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
If you hadn't protected me,

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
I will be miserable.

86
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,240
Don't look for me.

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,400
You should thank President Huo.

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,120
If he hadn't canceled the complaint,

89
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,360
I can't protect you.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,840
But then again,

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,720
The jade fragrance.

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Take care of yourself.

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
Why did President Huo fire you?

94
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,080
Don't you know?

95
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,880
You should remember more from now on.

96
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Don't...

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,720
To bully Ming Xiao.

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you for your advice.

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,280
However

100
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,600
Mr. Huo and Xiao Xiao

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
What's the relationship?

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,320
When I went there,

103
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
I found Xiao Xiao was there.

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
It's not like a home care.

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
It's okay to eat and drink.

106
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Even President Huo

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
And listen to her.

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,000
She's like half a mistress.

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,280
You shouldn't have asked.

111
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't ask around.

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,320
I haven't learned enough.

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Xiao Xiao.

114
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
You suffered so much.

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
If someone really treats you well,

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,840
It's worth it.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,320
feed

118
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,480
Hello

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Is this the Hong Kang Welfare Home?

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll find Mr. Zhao.

121
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,600
Yes

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,400
I have some information about Ming Xiao.

123
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,960
I need to talk to Miss Zhao.

124
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,520
Meng Guo.

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
To win people's hearts, you must be real.

126
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
To make it useful.

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,920
Even if you give it to me,

128
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
A deposit for help.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,640
As for the follow-up,

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Only more than this.

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Second Young Master.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,960
I work for the company.

133
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,560
And you still get paid.

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
How can I take your money?

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,480
Are smart people.

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,960
What are you wearing?

137
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,560
Huo Yunting is fine.

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,440
You insisted on coming here.

139
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
What vacation?

140
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,160
For a few months.

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
Everyone in the company is surprised.

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,200
I didn't mean anything else.

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,840
I just want to ask my brother

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,200
How is your health?

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
Do you really want to

146
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,760
Things have gone wrong.

147
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Don't you have to follow me sooner or later?

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
By then,

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,760
You are the vice president of the Huo clan.

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
You don't have to be pitiful anymore.

151
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,800
As a special assistant?

152
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,160
Second Young Master.

153
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
You really think highly of me.

154
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm an outsider.

155
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,080
How capable are you?

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,760
How much food?

157
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
The vice president of what company?

158
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,480
I can't do it.

159
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,600
Thank you for your kindness.

160
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,280
Correct!

161
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
You have time to worry.

162
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,800
Mr. Huo's body

163
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
It's better to take care of yourself.

164
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Meng Guo.

165
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,280
What do you mean?

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,800
You're here.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's nothing.

168
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
You have to think about your mother.

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
To take care of a partially disabled person.

170
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
And cancer patients.

171
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,840
It's not easy.

172
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,840
Or you?

173
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Go and water it.

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
You were shaken by the craps again.

175
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,560
The die has six sides.

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
The five faces are all painted with me.

177
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,640
It must be me.

178
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,440
When I'm working,

179
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I knew I wouldn't play with you.

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
Such a childish game.

181
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
It's not my fault.

182
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,080
You said it yourself.

183
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
Xiao Xiao drew the sun.

184
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,520
The best.

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,120
As pretty as Mr. Huo.

186
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,200
So I drew a few more.

187
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,240
The kettle should be raised.

188
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
Otherwise, the sprinkling will be uneven.

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Don't stare at me.

190
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,080
Manager Wang usually

191
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
That's what he taught us.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This Manager Wang

193
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,200
You can't teach well.

194
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,280
You little fool.

195
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
You can bully me.

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,280
Miss Zhao.

197
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm Xiao Xiao.

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
I miss you too.

199
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
My current job

200
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,440
It's great.

201
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,240
owner

202
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,000
The owner

203
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,480
And good.

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Xiaoxiao

205
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm worried about you.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,880
You're too simple.

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
You're not fit to work at home.

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Especially not.

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,200
To live with a stranger.

210
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
If you don't want to do it,

211
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
I'll talk to your manager Wang.

212
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,160
all right?

213
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,160
but

214
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
I think it's good here.

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
I thought

216
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
It's hard to stay at home.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,400
but

218
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
My cooking is good.

219
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,880
Miss Zhao.

220
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,240
Can you please

221
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't tell the manager.

222
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
Let me try.

223
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,520
and

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
This time,

225
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,520
It will be over soon.

226
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,120
I want to do it well.

227
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,600
Alright then.

228
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,200
You've grown up.

229
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,040
Has always been

230
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,200
A good boy with ideas.

231
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,320
but

232
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
If there's any danger,

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
You must call first.

234
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
To the teacher and Long Feng.

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,680
Okay?

236
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,240
All right.

237
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,840
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Brother Long Feng,

239
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,520
After a while,

240
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,440
To see me.

241
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Don't worry.

242
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,880
Goodbye, teacher.

243
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,680
Bye

244
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Still thinking about that?

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Brother Feng is here to see you.

246
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,480
That Nanny Bao Nan

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,480
What's good about it?

248
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
What is it?

249
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Mom, please.

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,800
However

251
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Brother Long Feng,

252
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
He is the best.

253
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
He's good.

254
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Won many awards.

255
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,680
He also...

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,760
And kind.

257
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,480
Will save the kitten with me.

258
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,760
and

259
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,920
He's handsome.

260
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,280
How could you tell?

261
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,040
Are men handsome or not?

262
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,680
Then tell me.

263
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,600
He and I

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,520
Who is more handsome?

265
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm not telling you.

266
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,600
MingXiaoxiao

267
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,680
No matter what the wind is,

268
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,080
You can only stay

269
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,880
When I'm alone,

270
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,640
Lord Huo.

271
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you kidding me?

272
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
The last acquisition contract

273
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
I can't even see it.

274
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
How dare you lower the price?

275
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
The hostile merger contract.

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,560
Lin Xi.

277
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,760
He who knows the times is a good man.

278
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,640
What's the current situation?

279
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,920
The Huo family will be

280
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Will be changed soon.

281
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,040
and

282
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,440
How long can the Lin family last?

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,920
You know that.

284
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
Linxi

285
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,560
Last time I came here, I invited you to cooperate.

286
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,600
This time,

287
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
Just a notice.

288
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
If you are not satisfied,

289
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Then don't blame me.

290
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,800
My men are ruthless.

291
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
The Huo family changed hands.

292
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,120
With you,

293
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,040
If we add another one,

294
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Where is Meng Guo?

295
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Linxi

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Huo Yunting's body

297
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
How long can we last?

298
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,560
Why are you so anxious?

299
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
And hide here to recuperate.

300
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Don't you know anything about it?

301
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,880
You mean Huo Yunting?

302
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,600
My health is failing.

303
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
That's impossible.

304
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Of course

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,840
Miss Lin, you've been

306
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,040
The conditions are good.

307
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,640
therefore

308
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,880
After we cooperate and win,

309
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
You can

310
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
To be my good wife.

311
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
It's no better than a strong one.

312
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,040
Is Huo Yunting's idea strong?

313
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,680
Stop talking nonsense.

314
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Huo Yunting and I

315
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,000
It's just business.

316
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,920
That's enough.

317
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,760
Although Huo Yunting

318
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,360
Closed sanatorium.

319
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,920
But in the four weeks,

320
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,880
Are all my eyes.

321
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,320
You are so thoughtful.

322
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
I know everything.

323
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,560
and

324
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
I know him better.

325
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
I have no interest in you.

326
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,720
Instead, I'm obsessed with

327
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,760
Mentally handicapped.

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
It's tasty.

329
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Obsessed with retarded girls.

330
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,120
Well

331
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,360
Are you saying that

332
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Well

333
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,480
Yes

334
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,520
The cleaner.

335
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
MingXiaoxiao

336
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,560
Lord Huo.

337
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
You can say

338
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
I can't do business.

339
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,240
but

340
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,680
I really don't like it.

341
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,320
Others doubt me.

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,480
In the eyes of men,

343
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,320
therefore

344
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Please don't.

345
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,200
To bother me again.

346
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,720
Don't bother.

347
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,680
Mr. Huo,

348
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
I always think that

349
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,360
It's weird.

350
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
I don't know.

351
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,520
When will it happen?

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
I don't know.

353
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
What is the most effective medicine?

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
You don't want to see a doctor.

355
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,440
It's really hard for me.

356
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
It's my first time to see you like this.

357
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
With a long face.

358
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,280
It's me.

359
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,280
You were bullied by bad guys.

360
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,040
And fell ill.

361
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
It's been too long.

362
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,400
It can't be cured.

363
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
therefore

364
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
Be nice to me.

365
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,240
such

366
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,600
At least when I was sick,

367
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,880
You won't be too sad.

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,240
Well

369
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,760
Mr. Huo,

370
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,520
Don't worry.

371
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,040
You are my man now.

372
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,080
If the bad guys dare to come,

373
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,840
I just...

374
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,720
And beat them.

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,440
To protect you.

376
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,040
What if

377
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,800
Mr. Zhao and Brother Long Feng

378
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,720
Are bullying me.

379
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,080
I won't.

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,040
They are good people.

381
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,680
I won't bully Mr. Huo.

382
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,320
I don't care.

383
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,600
They are bullying me.

384
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,880
What are you going to do?

385
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,040
Whose side are you on?

386
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,440
I

387
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,080
Can I stand in the middle?

388
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
The two of them

389
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,080
You can't fight.

390
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
Obsessed with retarded girls.

391
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,040
It's so ironic.

392
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,800
Meng Tezhu.

393
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,440
of surprise

394
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,520
Miss Lin,

395
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,440
It's so early.

396
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,280
Are you here to see President Huo?

397
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,600
No

398
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,400
Meng Tezhu.

399
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm here to see you.

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,760
Sorry, Miss Lin.

401
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
I just got off the plane.

402
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
I haven't told the boss yet.

403
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Tell me what you want to say.

404
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,720
Meng Tezhu.

405
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,040
I know you are...

406
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,760
You don't care about me.

407
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,520
I think

408
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,680
I want to marry into the Huo family.

409
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
A gold digger with a hug.

410
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,480
But it's okay.

411
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,440
I will show you

412
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
My strength

413
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Miss Lin is too thoughtful.

414
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,280
What about me?

415
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
She's a little assistant.

416
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Do you have any opinions?

417
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,160
What do you think?

418
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,560
Is not important to you.

419
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,760
If Miss Lin stops me,

420
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Just to say these words.

421
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
Then we don't have

422
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,400
We need to talk.

423
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,040
If I had known you were going to

424
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,840
Where are Huo Fenglei and his father?

425
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,160
This news

426
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,560
Is it worth it?

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,320
A little more respect.

428
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,040
I don't know, Miss Lin.

429
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,600
What are you talking about?

430
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,560
My respect for you

431
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
It's useless.

432
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,360
Meng Guo.

433
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,360
Help me.

434
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Help me get rid of that retarded girl.

435
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,360
To handle Huo Yunting.

436
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,040
after

437
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,080
We are on the same boat.

438
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
Who share weal and woe.

439
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,080
to be sorry

440
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm really in a hurry.

441
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,760
Meng Guo.

442
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
You will regret it.

443
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,960
No man can be trusted.

444
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,400
MingXiaoxiao

445
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,240
We'll see.

446
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,160
Hello, Mr. Lin.

447
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:05,840
I

448
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,920
I'm new here.

449
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,760
Intern, Long Feng.

450
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I heard that you came to see me last night.

451
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll take the bus overnight.

452
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,760
To the resort.

453
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,760
However

454
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,080
still

455
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,160
Five minutes late.

456
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,080
to be sorry

457
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,840
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,280
Longfeng

459
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,400
The other only knows how to study.

460
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
A brat.

461
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,360
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

462
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,840
I don't quite understand what you mean.

463
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,800
I know.

464
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
As a new intern,

465
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,480
I must have many

466
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Where progress is needed.

467
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,680
but

468
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
It's not as bad as you said.

469
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,680
You want to tell me

470
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,800
You're the president of the Student Union.

471
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Outstanding graduates.

472
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
I have these titles.

473
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,840
Not to be worth a hair

474
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,920
I know.

475
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,360
People say you're

476
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
The best in the school.

477
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,920
A good student.

478
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
But in my opinion,

479
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
You're a coward.

480
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
A coward without creativity.

481
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,160
Even the girl you like

482
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I dare not fight for it.

483
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,080
you

484
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,000
How do you know?

485
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,480
Who do I like?

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,200
wrong

487
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:19,960
Mr. Lin,

488
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,000
You investigated me.

489
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,720
Don't be surprised.

490
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,920
I have many ways.

491
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,160
means

492
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,800
Is far beyond your imagination.

493
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
But that's not important.

494
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,120
No matter what kind of person you are,

495
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,440
Since I chose you,

496
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,640
that

497
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
Your good day.

498
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,800
Is coming.

499
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,640
When you treat people

500
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,800
It's great.

501
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,480
And then,

502
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,840
Very bad.

503
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,720
Don't understand.

504
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,080
That's who I am.

505
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
You can't stand it. Let's go.

506
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,920
You are pretending to be kind.

507
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,880
It's good to have them all gone.

508
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,160
good

509
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,920
Don't be angry.

510
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,120
I'm not.

511
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,160
Mr. Huo,

512
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,840
We

513
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,840
Don't keep your distance.

514
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,400
Sit back.

515
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,760
Don't hurt your leg again.

516
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,720
Why are your feet so cold?

517
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,640
I said no.

518
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,480
Come out and blow the air.

519
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,840
Will it be warmer?

520
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,160
You little fool.

521
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,040
You're inconsiderate to others.

522
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,160
Be careful which day

523
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,000
People don't even know it.

524
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,360
What?

525
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
We're not going to the beach.

526
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,920
I'll take you to another place.

527
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Mr. Huo, you're right.

528
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,520
The scenery here

529
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
It's so beautiful.

530
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,040
Look.

531
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,160
That's me.

532
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,040
I always told you.

533
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,320
Stray cat litter.

534
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,320
Wait a moment.

535
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,880
We can build a cat house together.

536
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,480
It's very interesting.

537
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,960
naive

538
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
There's a waste of time.

539
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Just buy one.

540
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,160
You don't understand.

541
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,880
A nest of my own.

542
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,960
Is home?

543
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,520
Stray cats.

544
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,240
I really like my home.

545
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
It's no worse than online shopping.

546
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,720
Your cat is really happy.

547
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,240
And a home.

548
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
You have it too?

549
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,120
The Second Division.

550
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,720
In the whole park.

551
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,640
The most beautiful house in the world.

552
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Big house.

553
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,120
Is not necessarily home.

554
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,600
It's okay.

555
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,640
As long as you

556
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,840
No more tantrums.

557
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,560
You can live here.

558
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,840
My home

559
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,000
home

560
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,560
I can have a home.

561
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,480
It's Ming Xiao Xiao.

562
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,760
Together?

563
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,320
that

564
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Thank you for letting me stay.

565
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:05,960
you're welcome

566
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,280
MingXiaoxiao

567
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,520
You ran too fast.

568
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,200
Wait for me.

569
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,640
MingXiaoxiao

570
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,200
You're really lucky.

571
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,880
With such a thick thigh,

572
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,880
but

573
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,920
As long as I'm Liu Yufen,

574
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
You're still here.

575
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
It's not your turn to stand out.

576
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,240
Mgjmgtmgj

577
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,000
Manager

578
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,040
Just take it.

579
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,480
Mr. Huo is so fierce.

580
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,640
She went crazy yesterday.

581
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
You had to fire me.

582
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,880
If you hadn't protected me,

583
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
I will be miserable.

584
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,440
Don't look for me.

585
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,600
You should thank President Huo.

586
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,320
If he hadn't canceled the complaint,

587
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
I can't protect you.

588
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,040
But then again,

589
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,920
The jade fragrance.

590
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Take care of yourself.

591
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,320
Why did President Huo fire you?

592
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,280
Don't you know?

593
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,080
You should remember more from now on.

594
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,040
Don't...

595
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,920
To bully Ming Xiao.

596
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,280
Thank you for your advice.

597
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,480
However

598
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,800
Mr. Huo and Xiao Xiao

599
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,240
What's the relationship?

600
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,520
When I went there,

601
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
I found Xiao Xiao was there.

602
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,920
It's not like a home care.

603
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,880
It's okay to eat and drink.

604
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,920
Even President Huo

605
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
And listen to her.

606
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,200
She's like half a mistress.

607
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,200
What are you talking about?

608
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,480
You shouldn't have asked.

609
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,200
Don't ask around.

610
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,520
I haven't learned enough.

611
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
Xiao Xiao.

612
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,480
You suffered so much.

613
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
If someone really treats you well,

614
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,040
It's worth it.

615
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,520
feed

616
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,680
Hello

617
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,600
Is this the Hong Kang Welfare Home?

618
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll find Mr. Zhao.

619
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:13,800
Yes

620
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,600
I have some information about Ming Xiao.

621
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,160
I need to talk to Miss Zhao.

622
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,720
Meng Guo.

623
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,760
To win people's hearts, you must be real.

624
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,040
To make it useful.

625
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,120
Even if you give it to me,

626
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,840
A deposit for help.

627
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,840
As for the follow-up,

628
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Only more than this.

629
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,480
Second Young Master.

630
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,160
I work for the company.

631
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,760
And you still get paid.

632
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
How can I take your money?

633
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,680
Are smart people.

634
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,160
What are you wearing?

635
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,760
Huo Yunting is fine.

636
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,640
You insisted on coming here.

637
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
What vacation?

638
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,360
For a few months.

639
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,920
Everyone in the company is surprised.

640
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
I didn't mean anything else.

641
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,040
I just want to ask my brother

642
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,400
How is your health?

643
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,040
Do you really want to

644
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,960
Things have gone wrong.

645
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,240
Don't you have to follow me sooner or later?

646
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
By then,

647
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,960
You are the vice president of the Huo clan.

648
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,840
You don't have to be pitiful anymore.

649
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,000
As a special assistant?

650
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,360
Second Young Master.

651
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
You really think highly of me.

652
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm an outsider.

653
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,280
How capable are you?

654
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,960
How much food?

655
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,640
The vice president of what company?

656
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,680
I can't do it.

657
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,800
Thank you for your kindness.

658
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,480
Correct!

659
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,960
You have time to worry.

660
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,000
Mr. Huo's body

661
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,560
It's better to take care of yourself.

662
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,720
Meng Guo.

663
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,480
What do you mean?

664
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,000
You're here.

665
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's nothing.

666
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,280
You have to think about your mother.

667
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,040
To take care of a partially disabled person.

668
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
And cancer patients.

669
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
It's not easy.

670
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,040
Or you?

671
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,280
Go and water it.

672
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,400
You were shaken by the craps again.

673
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,760
The die has six sides.

674
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,840
The five faces are all painted with me.

675
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,840
It must be me.

676
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,640
When I'm working,

677
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,200
I knew I wouldn't play with you.

678
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,080
Such a childish game.

679
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,920
It's not my fault.

680
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,280
You said it yourself.

681
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,920
Xiao Xiao drew the sun.

682
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,720
The best.

683
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,320
As pretty as Mr. Huo.

684
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,400
So I drew a few more.

685
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,440
The kettle should be raised.

686
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,000
Otherwise, the sprinkling will be uneven.

687
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Don't stare at me.

688
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,280
Manager Wang usually

689
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,240
That's what he taught us.

690
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
This Manager Wang

691
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,400
You can't teach well.

692
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,480
You little fool.

693
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
You can bully me.

694
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,480
Miss Zhao.

695
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,480
I'm Xiao Xiao.

696
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,440
I miss you too.

697
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,320
My current job

698
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,640
It's great.

699
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,440
owner

700
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,200
The owner

701
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,680
And good.

702
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,360
Xiaoxiao

703
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,840
I'm worried about you.

704
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,080
You're too simple.

705
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,840
You're not fit to work at home.

706
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,000
Especially not.

707
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,400
To live with a stranger.

708
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,920
If you don't want to do it,

709
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,720
I'll talk to your manager Wang.

710
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,360
all right?

711
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,360
but

712
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,680
I think it's good here.

713
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,560
I thought

714
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,720
It's hard to stay at home.

715
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,600
but

716
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
My cooking is good.

717
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,080
Miss Zhao.

718
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,440
Can you please

719
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,960
Don't tell the manager.

720
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,240
Let me try.

721
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,720
and

722
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,320
This time,

723
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,720
It will be over soon.

724
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,320
I want to do it well.

725
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:50,800
Alright then.

726
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,400
You've grown up.

727
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,240
Has always been

728
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,400
A good boy with ideas.

729
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,520
but

730
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,160
If there's any danger,

731
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,440
You must call first.

732
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
To the teacher and Long Feng.

733
00:44:59,640 --> 00:44:59,880
Okay?

734
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,440
OK

735
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,040
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

736
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,880
Brother Long Feng,

737
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,720
After a while,

738
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,640
To see me.

739
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,960
Don't worry.

740
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,080
Goodbye, teacher.

741
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:09,880
Bye

742
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,080
Still thinking about that?

743
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
Brother Feng is here to see you.

744
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,680
That Nanny Bao Nan

745
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,680
What's good about it?

746
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
What is it?

747
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Mom, please.

748
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,000
However

749
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,360
Brother Long Feng,

750
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,440
He is the best.

751
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,400
He's good.

752
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,320
Won many awards.

753
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,880
He also...

754
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,960
And kind.

755
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,680
Will save the kitten with me.

756
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,960
and

757
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,120
He's handsome.

758
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,480
How could you tell?

759
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,240
Are men handsome or not?

760
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,880
Then tell me.

761
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,800
He and I

762
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,720
Who is more handsome?

763
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,720
I'm not telling you.

764
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,800
MingXiaoxiao

765
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,880
No matter what the wind is,

766
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,280
You can only stay

767
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,080
When I'm alone,

768
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,840
Lord Huo.

769
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,200
Are you kidding me?

770
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,640
The last acquisition contract

771
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,280
I can't even see it.

772
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,600
How dare you lower the price?

773
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,160
The hostile merger contract.

774
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,760
Lin Xi.

775
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,960
He who knows the times is a good man.

776
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,840
What's the current situation?

777
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,120
The Huo family will be

778
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Will be changed soon.

779
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,240
and

780
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,640
How long can the Lin family last?

781
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,120
You know that.

782
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,200
Linxi

783
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,760
Last time I came here, I invited you to cooperate.

784
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,800
This time,

785
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,200
Just a notice.

786
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,080
If you are not satisfied,

787
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Then don't blame me.

788
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,000
My men are ruthless.

789
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,240
The Huo family changed hands.

790
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,320
With you,

791
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,240
If we add another one,

792
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,280
Where is Meng Guo?

793
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,680
Linxi

794
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Huo Yunting's body

795
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,960
How long can we last?

796
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,760
Why are you so anxious?

797
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,960
And hide here to recuperate.

798
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,880
Don't you know anything about it?

799
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,080
You mean Huo Yunting?

800
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,800
My health is failing.

801
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,800
That's impossible.

802
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,400
Of course

803
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,040
Miss Lin, you've been

804
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,240
The conditions are good.

805
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,840
therefore

806
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,080
After we cooperate and win,

807
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,840
You can

808
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,960
To be my good wife.

809
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,040
It's no better than a strong one.

810
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,240
Is Huo Yunting's idea strong?

811
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,880
Stop talking nonsense.

812
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,280
Huo Yunting and I

813
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,200
It's just business.

814
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,120
That's enough.

815
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,960
Although Huo Yunting

816
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,560
Closed sanatorium.

817
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,120
But in the four weeks,

818
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,080
Are all my eyes.

819
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,520
You are so thoughtful.

820
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,280
I know everything.

821
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,760
and

822
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,400
I know him better.

823
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
I have no interest in you.

824
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,920
Instead, I'm obsessed with

825
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:03,960
Mentally handicapped.

826
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,200
It's tasty.

827
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
Obsessed with retarded girls.

828
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,320
Well

829
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,560
Are you saying that

830
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:13,960
Well

831
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:14,680
Yes

832
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,720
The cleaner.

833
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
MingXiaoxiao

834
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,760
Lord Huo.

835
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,600
You can say

836
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,840
I can't do business.

837
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,440
but

838
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,880
I really don't like it.

839
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,520
Others doubt me.

840
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,680
In the eyes of men,

841
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,520
therefore

842
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,440
Please don't.

843
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,400
To bother me again.

844
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,920
Don't bother.

845
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,880
Mr. Huo,

846
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,200
I always think that

847
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,560
It's weird.

848
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,360
I don't know.

849
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,720
When will it happen?

850
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,240
I don't know.

851
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,000
What is the most effective medicine?

852
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,600
You don't want to see a doctor.

853
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,640
It's really hard for me.

854
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,320
It's my first time to see you like this.

855
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,240
With a long face.

856
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,480
It's me.

857
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,480
You were bullied by bad guys.

858
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,240
And fell ill.

859
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,520
It's been too long.

860
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,600
It can't be cured.

861
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,120
therefore

862
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,040
Be nice to me.

863
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,440
such

864
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,800
At least when I was sick,

865
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,080
You won't be too sad.

866
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,440
Well

867
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:47,960
Mr. Huo,

868
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,720
Don't worry.

869
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,240
You are my man now.

870
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,280
If the bad guys dare to come,

871
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,040
I just...

872
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:52,920
And beat them.

873
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,640
To protect you.

874
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,240
What if

875
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,000
Mr. Zhao and Brother Long Feng

876
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:58,920
Are bullying me.

877
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,280
I won't.

878
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,240
They are good people.

879
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,880
I won't bully Mr. Huo.

880
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,520
I don't care.

881
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,800
They are bullying me.

882
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,080
What are you going to do?

883
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,240
Whose side are you on?

884
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,640
I

885
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,280
Can I stand in the middle?

886
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,080
The two of them

887
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,280
You can't fight.

888
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,000
Obsessed with retarded girls.

889
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,240
It's so ironic.

890
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,000
Meng Tezhu.

891
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,640
of surprise

892
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,720
Miss Lin,

893
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:42,640
It's so early.

894
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,480
Are you here to see President Huo?

895
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,800
No

896
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,600
Meng Tezhu.

897
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,960
I'm here to see you.

898
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,960
Sorry, Miss Lin.

899
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,000
I just got off the plane.

900
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,480
I haven't told the boss yet.

901
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,480
Tell me what you want to say.

902
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,920
Meng Tezhu.

903
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,240
I know you are...

904
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,960
You don't care about me.

905
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,720
I think

906
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,880
I want to marry into the Huo family.

907
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
A gold digger with a hug.

908
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,680
But it's okay.

909
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,640
I will show you

910
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,200
My strength

911
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,520
Miss Lin is too thoughtful.

912
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,480
What about me?

913
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,080
She's a little assistant.

914
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,400
Do you have any opinions?

915
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,360
What do you think?

916
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,760
Is not important to you.

917
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,960
If Miss Lin stops me,

918
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Just to say these words.

919
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,840
Then we don't have

920
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,600
We need to talk.

921
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,240
If I had known you were going to

922
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,040
Where are Huo Fenglei and his father?

923
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,360
This news

924
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,760
Is it worth it?

925
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,520
A little more respect.

926
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,240
I don't know, Miss Lin.

927
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,800
What are you talking about?

928
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,760
My respect for you

929
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,560
It's useless.

930
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,560
Meng Guo.

931
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,560
Help me.

932
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
Help me get rid of that retarded girl.

933
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,560
To handle Huo Yunting.

934
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,240
after

935
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,280
We are on the same boat.

936
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,320
Who share weal and woe.

937
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,280
to be sorry

938
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,080
I'm really in a hurry.

939
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,960
Meng Guo.

940
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
You will regret it.

941
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,160
No man can be trusted.

942
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,600
MingXiaoxiao

943
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,440
We'll see.

944
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,360
Hello, Mr. Lin.

945
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,040
I

946
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,120
I'm new here.

947
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,960
Intern, Long Feng.

948
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
I heard that you came to see me last night.

949
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,200
I'll take the bus overnight.

950
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:30,960
To the resort.

951
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:31,960
However

952
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,280
still

953
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,360
Five minutes late.

954
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,280
to be sorry

955
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,040
I'm sorry.

956
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,480
Longfeng

957
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,600
The other only knows how to study.

958
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,400
A brat.
