1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,800
For me,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,920
to be or not to be,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
this is not a question.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
I have only three months left.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,160
I want revenge

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,480
for my mother

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,520
and for myself.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,240
No matter where I am,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,880
in what kind of way,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,240
I swear to make them

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
pay for their actions.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:35,840
Before,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
there was only hatred in my world.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,360
But that is not the case anymore

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
after I met her.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,920
It should be here.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,240
Nice.

18
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,880
No one knows I'm here.

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,080
Time is precious.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
Besides revenge,

21
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
I can't waste a moment on other things

22
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
including medical treatment,

23
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,760
taking medicine

24
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
or dealing with

25
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,800
trifles.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,080
Boss.

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Boss, go slowly.

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
Your leg suffers comminuted fracture.

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Don't tire yourself out.

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Meng Guo.

31
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
You're just an assistant.

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
How dare you make a decision for me?

33
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,360
Boss.

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,080
The treatment can't be delayed any longer.

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,360
No.

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Anyway,

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
there are only a few days left.

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
It's not like I haven't seen an expert before.

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,560
Is there any recovery?

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,880
Instead of wasting time on doctors,

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
we might as well come up with some ideas
to deal with Second Uncle.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Boss,

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
your health matters the most.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,640
Don't throw a tantrum like a child

45
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,320
whenever the treatment is mentioned.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,520
We tried our way to move to this remote place,

47
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
so keep it a secret.

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,400
The fewer people know, the better.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,680
Alright.

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,760
I'll check around.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
It seems

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
I can only spend the last few days

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,840
in this resort.

54
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
Fenfen, stop it.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
I did all the work

56
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,600
for you all day.

57
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,080
Let me sleep for a while.

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
It's really a poor place.

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
A cleaner dare sleep on the guest's couch.

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,320
Mannerless.

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,240
That's good.

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
No one will think of me, Huo Yunting,

63
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
to hide in such a place.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Wake up.

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,840
Leave now.

66
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,280
Fenfen.

67
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Let me sleep for a while.

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm too sleepy.

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,040
So it's a dream.

70
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,160
Sir.

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
You're really pretty.

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,280
Old tricks.

73
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,520
Can she be worse

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,360
in acting dumb?

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,520
Tell me,

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,920
who sent you here?

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,040
What did you hear

78
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,720
just now?

79
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,680
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
What do you mean
by who sent me here?

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm really sleepy.

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm going to bed.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,800
Boss, I've checked all the places.

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,040
It's safe...

85
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Meng Guo.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Who is this woman?

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,920
Boss, be careful.

88
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Ming Xiaoxiao.

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,880
Did you finish my work?

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,920
Come back as soon as you're done.

91
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,160
I heard

92
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,840
the high-maintenance Mr. Huo is coming.

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Don't bump into him.

94
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,200
Xiaoxiao,

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,520
pay attention to

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
the bed leg over there.

97
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,640
If you still can't make it well this time,

98
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
the manager will be angry again.

99
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay, Fenfen.

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Since the day shift and evening shift yesterday

101
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,400
to the whole day today,

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,080
I've been working for you.

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,160
Can I

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
get some sleep later?

105
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,680
Xiaoxiao, thank you for your hard work.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Just hold on a little longer.

107
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,400
The houses in the resort

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
are so beautiful.

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
Making them clean

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
every day

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
delights me.

112
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
You're poor yet happy.

113
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
With our low salary,

114
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
even working for a hundred years,

115
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
we can't afford a bedroom here.

116
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
A hundred years?

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,640
We can afford it.

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,920
As long as I work hard every day,

119
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,600
and with such a long time of a hundred years,

120
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
I'll be able to save money to buy a house.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,640
And

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
in the house,

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,000
there will be daddy, mommy and baby.

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,080
How happy will I be!

125
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Fine. You win.

126
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,040
Xiaoxiao.

127
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
Since you want to save money
to buy a house,

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
let me introduce a good work to you.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,960
What work?

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,120
Mr. Huo's villa,

131
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,680
the Building 2 in West Zone.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
I'll leave it to you to clean later.

133
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
The Building 2 in West Zone?

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Isn't that also

135
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
the work that Manager Wang gave you?

136
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,040
Do you have to draw a clear line

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
between my work and yours

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,840
when we are so close?

139
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,280
How about this?

140
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,840
You clean it for me

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,720
and I give you half of the overtime pay.

142
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,880
There's overtime pay?

143
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Alright then.

144
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,680
Who are you?

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,120
Who sent you here?

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,360
You approached me

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,720
with what intention?

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,120
You're speaking so fast

149
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
that I didn't catch you.

150
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,920
Moreover,

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,080
you're too fierce.

152
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
Giving irrelevant answers

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
cannot prove you innocent.

154
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,160
It's weird.

155
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,520
The floor has been cleaned
for three times today.

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
But there's no wind or rain

157
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
that dirtys the floor.

158
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,920
Is it possible that Mr. Huo

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
is doing this on purpose?

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,800
Mr. Huo?

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,040
Is that

162
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,240
Mr. Huo who wears a long face
and likes to throw a tantrum?

163
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,040
That's right.

164
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I heard

165
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,000
that he is ruthless
and difficult to deal with.

166
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,840
You haven't told me

167
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,280
about the cleaning yesterday.

168
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
Everything went well

169
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,360
and you didn't get on his nerves, right?

170
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,160
Well...

171
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,680
Xiaoxiao.

172
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,840
You need to speed up.

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,000
Before getting off work,

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,160
remember to fetch some soil.

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
Mr. Huo wants to grow plants here.

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
Manager Wang.

177
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
My workload today

178
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,200
seems to be overwhelming.

179
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,080
I haven't had my lunch yet.

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
That's right.

181
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
Even I have to suffer.

182
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,040
Manager, what's going on?

183
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:47,960
Xiaoxiao.

184
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,360
Xiaoxiao.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
How did you

186
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,200
offend Mr. Huo yesterday?

187
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm telling you,

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
you'd better

189
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
apologize to him.

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,720
Otherwise,

191
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
he will keep arranging works for you

192
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,920
and giving you a hard time.

193
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,960
It's definitely not what you want, right?

194
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,840
He should do it on purpose!

195
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,160
Brother Zu, slow down.

196
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Are you sure

197
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Huo Yunting will stay in this kind of place?

198
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,840
There's even no road.

199
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,680
Is your information accurate?

200
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
As sure as a gun.

201
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
He does live here.

202
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
But Brother Zu,

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
aren't we

204
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
taking Huo Yunting too seriously?

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,440
He's just a president with disease.

206
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,400
What's good about him?

207
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,520
Brother Zu, as long as you give the order,

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,440
I'll deal with him today.

209
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
And you can have

210
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,760
the property of the Huo family tomorrow.

211
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,200
What nonsense!

212
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,320
If it weren't for you

213
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,520
who ruined the car crash plan

214
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
by giving out a lot of flaws,

215
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,520
I wouldn't be scolded by my father

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
and come all the way to apologize to him.

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,720
I...

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
Just stop it.

219
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,880
He has no actual evidence

220
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,160
to prove it was us behind the car crash.

221
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
It doesn't matter to me.

222
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
But Brother Zu, you are

223
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
the legitimate descendant of the Huo family.

224
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
How can you be embarrassed

225
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
by an illegitimate son

226
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,640
like Huo Yunting.

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,360
Here.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Here.

229
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,480
Here.

230
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
What does he think he is?

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,320
If my uncle hadn't chosen him

232
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
as his heir,

233
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,160
Huo Yunting would have died.

234
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,840
Boss.

235
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,040
I have investigated.

236
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
That Ming Xiao Xiao

237
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,880
is proved to be

238
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,920
just a regular cleaner.

239
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,480
She is an orphan raised in a welfare home

240
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,720
so she really has nothing to do

241
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,680
with Second Uncle.

242
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,840
And

243
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
she's young and has low response.

244
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,800
Please don't be angry with her anymore.

245
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
You sure know how to care about the weak

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
and beg for leniency for others.

247
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Brief me what you found.

248
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,360
Look at this.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,720
Lin Group,

250
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
after being exposed to financial fraud,

251
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,240
was delisted, and cannot hide
their huge losses and foreign debts

252
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,920
from the public anymore.

253
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,080
As you expected,

254
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
they won't last long.

255
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,880
Did Mr. Lin do anything?

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
Is there any sign of him
plotting with Huo Fenglei?

257
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,640
Not really.

258
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,280
Second Uncle

259
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,440
can't handle the Lin family.

260
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
After Mr. Lin resigned,

261
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
the Lin family is now managed

262
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
by his only daughter, Lin Xi.

263
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,320
In my opinion,

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,920
she came to us for help.

265
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,080
Boss.

266
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,280
Since we will swallow the Lin family
sooner or later,

267
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,560
why don't we

268
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,880
let her come and talk to us?

269
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,520
Lin Xi.

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
With her ability,

271
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,320
she should be able to find me by herself.

272
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,120
See.

273
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,640
I said I could find Huo Yunting.

274
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm a man of my words.

275
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,000
He's here now.

276
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
How will you thank me?

277
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,360
Young Master Huo, thank you for all the hard work.

278
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Don't pretend in front of me.

279
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Every one

280
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
can see through your thoughts.

281
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,400
All is done for Huo Yunting, right?

282
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,440
Forget it.

283
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
I don't care about your mess.

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,880
My dad

285
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
asked me to give it to you in person.

286
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Sign it now

287
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
so my part will be done.

288
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
The acquisition contract of Lin Group?

289
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Sorry, Mr. Huo.

290
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,280
If you only want to drink,

291
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
I can keep you company.

292
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
If you want to talk about acquisition,

293
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,360
I think I'll pass.

294
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
We

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
have no intention of selling the company.

296
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,520
Didn't you talk about it

297
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
with my dad already?

298
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,040
What?

299
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,720
You changed your mind?

300
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,880
My dad said

301
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,800
now the Lin family is in trouble,

302
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
you little girl

303
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
can't solve it alone.

304
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Why don't you ask him to help you?

305
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
It's good for everyone.

306
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,880
Mr. Huo.

307
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,720
Do you still think of yourself
as a three-year-old child?

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,920
You're old enough

309
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,600
to think by yourself
instead of relying on your dad.

310
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:56,880
You...

311
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Lin Xi.

312
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
You'd better read the contract.

313
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,520
Although the price is a bit lower,

314
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
you and your dad

315
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,000
won't have to

316
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
suffer hunger and sleep on the street.

317
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,960
It's better

318
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
than waiting for Huo Yunting

319
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,160
to love and save you.

320
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,840
Whatever, I'm willing to.

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,360
It's up to you.

322
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
You'd better not regret it.

323
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,720
Right!

324
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,280
I forgot to tell you.

325
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,880
Without me,

326
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
even if you come,

327
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
you can't find Huo Yunting.

328
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,880
Mr. Huo.

329
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,920
I won't bother you

330
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,960
with such a small matter.

331
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
See you.

332
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,760
Special Assistant Meng.

333
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,480
Hello.

334
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,080
Hello.

335
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
I'm Lin Xi from the Lin Family.

336
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,360
I have communicated with you before.

337
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,520
Sorry, Miss Lin.

338
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,320
Mr. Huo

339
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
is occupied recently.

340
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,720
He really can't spare some time to meet you.

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,680
Hello, Miss.

342
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,640
Welcome to check in.

343
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm the cleaner for you today,

344
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
Ming Xiaoxiao.

345
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,760
The room has been

346
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,000
cleaned up.

347
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,280
Is there anything lese

348
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
you want me to do?

349
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,560
It's okay.

350
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,120
It's quite clean.

351
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
What's your name again?

352
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
My name is Ming Xiaoxiao.

353
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,040
Ming Xiaoxiao.

354
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,240
You've done your work well.

355
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,560
How about this?

356
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,440
Let's befreind on WeChat.

357
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,000
From now on,

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,600
the cleaning of my place

359
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,400
will be all yours.

360
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,280
Don't worry.

361
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,280
I won't treat you unfairly.

362
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,640
I...

363
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
I don't understand.

364
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,400
I...

365
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
I'm a little slow.

366
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Are you telling me

367
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,520
to go back to work?

368
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,880
It's OK today.

369
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,080
Your work is done.

370
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,360
Take out your phone.

371
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,600
Let's add each other on WeChat.

372
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
WeChat?

373
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,360
Miss.

374
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,200
I don't know much about WeChat.

375
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
Can we text?

376
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,200
Text?

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,080
Then...

378
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,520
Mr. Huo used to laugh.

379
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,280
You know him?

380
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
He's Mr. Huo.

381
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
Great, little sister.

382
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,160
Come and sit down.

383
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,760
If you tell me

384
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
where Mr. Huo lives,

385
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,320
I will

386
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
treat you to a cake.

387
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,520
Xiaoxiao.

388
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,600
Brother Lang Feng,

389
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,920
why are you here?

390
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,560
I was just thinking

391
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,000
to take a photo and send it to you.

392
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,280
A beautiful Miss

393
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,520
gave me a super delicious cake.

394
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,200
Xiaoxiao,

395
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
when it comes to eating cake,

396
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,200
you are so happy.

397
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
You said so many words in one breath.

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,120
You didn't even stutter at all.

399
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
You're making fun of me, right?

400
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,640
I won't talk to you.

401
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,920
But

402
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,920
I have two pieces of good news for you.

403
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,320
Xiaoxiao, if you ignore me,

404
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,400
you won't be able to hear it.

405
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What good news?

406
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,680
The first good news is that

407
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,740
I have graduated successfully

408
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
and also got

409
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,780
Certificate of Honor for Outstanding Graduates.

410
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,860
Brother Lang Feng,

411
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,140
you're great.

412
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,300
I knew it.

413
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,540
You're the best.

414
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,260
The second good news is that

415
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,900
my boss assigned me to work here.

416
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,260
What about it?

417
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:48,900
Are you happy?

418
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,860
Really?

419
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,620
That's good!

420
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,020
We can meet every day.

421
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,500
However,

422
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,580
will your mom agree?

423
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,100
She doesn't like our meeting.

424
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,060
My mom is always like that.

425
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,860
Don't bother her.

426
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,500
Xiaoxiao.

427
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm already an adult.

428
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,580
In the future,

429
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,020
I will earn a lot of money

430
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,940
and form my own family.

431
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:09,980
Anyway,

432
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,220
I just want to be with you.

433
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,660
Well,

434
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
I will try my best too.

435
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:14,980
In the future,

436
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,820
let's work together.

437
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,860
Come on.

438
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,380
We will have our own family.

439
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,340
Yes.

440
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,620
There will be

441
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
our own home.

442
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,860
What's wrong with you?
