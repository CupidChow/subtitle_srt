1
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,760
Boss,

2
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,720
you love Xiaoxiao so much,

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
So you have to live a few more days?

4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,960
Am I right?

5
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,520
That's the only way you can

6
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,640
see her for a few more days,

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,880
There's nothing like it.

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
Looking at the person you love,

9
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,040
it's better to live

10
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,760
a happy life.

11
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,560
Am I right?

12
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,840
In this world,

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
there's nothing like saving a drowning man.

14
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,600
And he broke his driftwood with his own hands.

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
It's even crueler.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,160
I hope she forgets me.

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm afraid she'll really forget me.

18
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,600
Meng Guo,

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
I think I'm crazy.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,320
I really can't stand it anymore.

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,440
I'll get Xiaoxiao back

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,160
for you right now.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,640
No.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,040
Don't call her back.

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
It took me a long time

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,840
to make it this far,

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,120
It took a lot of effort

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
to set her free.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,240
I can't let her get stuck

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
in this mess anymore.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,760
Meng Guo,

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,600
you're right.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
I should live a few more days.

34
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,480
Make an appointment to go to the hospital.

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,360
Okay.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,040
I only watched it secretly for one day.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,960
Meng,

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
I pulled up all the curtains

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
of the villa.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
I'll never see

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,720
Mr. Huo again.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,080
Xiaoxiao,

43
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,680
I've thought about it.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
This place

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,680
is a sad place now.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,760
If you want to leave,

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,600
we'll leave

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,120
right away.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,040
If you want to stay,

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,880
I'll stay here with you.

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
You can do whatever you want.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
You don't have to accept me as your boyfriend,

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
I just want you to be happy.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,400
Live happily every day.

55
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
Brother Lang Feng.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,040
Me,

57
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm too stupid

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,200
to be your girlfriend.

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,360
You shouldn't be

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
so nice to me.

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Because we'll always be

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
best friends,

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,720
Silly girl,

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
Brother Lang Feng can support you.

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,320
But now,

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,640
I hope you can

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
calm down and figure out

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,280
what is the most important thing

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
for you.

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
You're an adult now.

71
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,320
You have to understand,

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,800
infinite sadness.

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
It won't solve the problem.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,800
Only by learning to love yourself first,

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
can you love others better.

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,000
What's the most important thing?

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
Most importantly.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
My piggy bank.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,080
Xiaoxiao,

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,040
what are you doing,

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Meng Guo and I are going to see

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,880
a doctor,

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm in a hurry.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,640
Wait for me.

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,680
It'll be quick.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,840
Mr. Huo,

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,120
my piggy bank is very important.

88
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,120
But you.

89
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,760
More important.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Buy me a new one.

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
Then I can forget

92
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,920
all the bad things

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,920
in the past.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,960
But I'm going to

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
give it to you now.

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
When you see it,

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,920
you will think of me.

98
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,800
Although I don't know

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,560
why

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
you suddenly don't like me,

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
You don't want to be with me anymore.

102
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,880
But I still

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
like you very, very much.

104
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,720
I will try to save money

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,200
in the future,

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
I'll buy a house

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,920
and wait for you to go home.

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,240
Xiaoxiao,

109
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,560
come back.

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,920
Xiaoxiao,

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,920
Meng Guo,

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,080
Forget it,

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,840
Xiaoxiao, she's not going to stay.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
She listened to

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
everything I said.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,360
Meng Guo,

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
after I died,

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,480
Scatter my ashes

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
into the moat,

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,680
If we can surround

121
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
this city forever,

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
Look at her from afar

123
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,760
and protect her.

124
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,240
I'm satisfied.

125
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,040
Xiaoxiao,

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
I have a letter of resignation,

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,320
I can't find it on the table.

128
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Did you see that?

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,080
Xiaoxiao,

130
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,800
Xiaoxiao,

131
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,880
What's wrong with you?

132
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh no.

133
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,280
Mr. Huo

134
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,960
misses Mr. Huo.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,840
Hey,

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Huo Yun Ting,

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,760
come here.

138
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,200
Xiaoxiao, she has a high fever.

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,840
Let her have

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,600
a good sleep here,

141
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,360
I'll be fine tomorrow.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Mr. Huo,

143
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,680
I miss you so much.

144
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,280
Silly girl,

145
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
she can't sleep well these days.

146
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Just stay with her for a while.

147
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,560
Little fool,

148
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,760
you always say you're healthy,

149
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
It's powerful.

150
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Actually, I know,

151
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,680
I failed to

152
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
protect you this time.

153
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080
You always say you're a good boy

154
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,440
who's not picky about food,

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,440
Actually, I know

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
you like ice cream and fish the most.

157
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
I hate bitter

158
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
gourd and coriander the most,

159
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,840
Everything about you,

160
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
I will always remember it.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
I won't forget it

162
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,360
until I'm in the grave.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,640
I don't know if I can

164
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,440
find a small fish,

165
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,680
Why are you picking up fish?

166
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
If the baby eats more fish,

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,720
he'll become smarter.

168
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
We have everything now.

169
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,840
All we need is a smart baby.

170
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay,

171
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
We, Xiaoxiao, can say anything.

172
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Our baby

173
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
will be like you,

174
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,080
Cute,

175
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,520
Kindness,

176
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,320
No.

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
The baby needs to be

178
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,760
as smart

179
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,480
as Mr. Huo.

180
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,120
Silly girl.

181
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,040
Our baby,

182
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
of course, looks like the two of us.

183
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,080
What's there to argue about?

184
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,280
Yeah,

185
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
we're so stupid.

186
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,520
Xiaoxiao,

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,640
Xiaoxiao,

188
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,000
Your fever has just remitted.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,160
Why did you sneak out?

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,960
Xiaoxiao,

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
you really scared me.

192
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Do you feel uncomfortable in the future?

193
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,520
Be sure to tell my brother in time.

194
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,080
Do you hear me?

195
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm fine.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Brother Lang Feng,

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,920
I just had

198
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,480
a long, long dream.

199
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
I dreamed that,

200
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,000
with Mr. Huo,

201
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,160
Let's cook fish together.

202
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's move to a new house together.

203
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,320
And she gave birth to

204
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
a lovely baby.

205
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
But I just woke up

206
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,680
and realized

207
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
it was a dream.

208
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,640
Xiaoxiao,

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
if you keep dreaming about someone,

210
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,480
It's time

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:32,960
to say

212
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
goodbye to him.

213
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,160
I don't understand

214
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,680
why love disappears?

215
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
Why do you have to say goodbye?

216
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
If you have a fever

217
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,920
and dream about Mr. Huo,

218
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm willing to get sick every day.

219
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,080
Xiaoxiao,

220
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
wake up,

221
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,800
Huo Yun Ting separated from you,

222
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,600
not because he doesn't love you,

223
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,640
but

224
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
He has a lot of problems,

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
but he can't solve them.

226
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Every adult has

227
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,000
his own problems to solve.

228
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
Since you've grown up,

229
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,040
since you love him,

230
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
Give him enough time.

231
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,720
Let him solve these problems.

232
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,080
Okay?

233
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,040
Okay,

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will try my best to do it.

235
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960
I'll wait for Mr. Huo

236
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
to come back.

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,000
All right,

238
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I've been crying for an hour.

239
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
I didn't give you a hard time

240
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,240
when you quit.

241
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
You're such a big man,

242
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
how can you do such a small thing?

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,160
How infatuated is Ming Xiaoxiao?

244
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
I wonder if they'll

245
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,040
see each other again?

246
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,280
I can't imagine

247
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,560
what would happen

248
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,320
if Xiaoxiao left Huo Yunting?

249
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Lang Feng,

250
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,520
I really can't understand you.

251
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Huo Yun Ting has sent

252
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,680
Ming Xiao Xiao to you.

253
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Aren't you going to take love?

254
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,720
Forget it.

255
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,160
I can't believe you said

256
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,040
such stupid things,

257
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,360
Of course I love her.

258
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
But because I love her,

259
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,480
I want her to be good.

260
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,760
Yes

261
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,320
Huo Yun Ting

262
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
may not be a good person,

263
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,920
But he's a good lover.

264
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
So I can't

265
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,760
let my obsession and prejudice.

266
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,600
Break them up.

267
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,120
Otherwise my conscience

268
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
will be disturbed

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
by conscience and love,

270
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,120
I haven't seen it

271
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,840
for a long time.

272
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,640
But,

273
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
haven't we all

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,800
seen each other now?

275
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Miss Lin,

276
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,680
spare yourself.

277
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,640
I want Xiaoxiao to be happy.

278
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
I hope you can have a good life.

279
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Even though you're going to be

280
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
Mrs. Huo,

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
But will you really be happy?

282
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,320
Lang Feng, what do you mean?

283
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,160
I'm going to be

284
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,760
Mrs. Huo,

285
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,440
How could I not be happy?

286
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,160
Get lost!

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,880
Get out of here right now!

288
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,240
Right away.

289
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,800
Boss,

290
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,520
now that Xiaoxiao

291
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,400
has made a clear investigation.

292
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,200
If you're fine,

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
just go to

294
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,560
the hospital.

295
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,920
Meng Guo,

296
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,080
do you think I made a mistake

297
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,520
and pretended to marry Lin Xi?

298
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
Force Xiaoxiao to leave.

299
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,720
I thought she would live a better life.

300
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,880
But unexpectedly,

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
she suffered so much,

302
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
That's why I didn't approve of you

303
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,880
breaking up from the very beginning.

304
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,920
All you see is that

305
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,720
after Xiaoxiao left you,

306
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
She's in a lot of pain.

307
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,680
But no one knows that

308
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,840
all these pains

309
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,080
will bite back on you.

310
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,640
Boss,

311
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,160
neither you

312
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,480
nor Xiaoxiao

313
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,400
deserves this pain.

314
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't expect that I'd be

315
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
so indecisive one day,

316
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,000
People,

317
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,120
with love,

318
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,720
There will be worries.

319
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,960
There's a weakness,

320
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,000
it seems,

321
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,200
No one can escape.

322
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,480
Not only that,

323
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,840
love makes people vulnerable.

324
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,320
But love also makes people strong.

325
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:31,960
You see,

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
Xiaoxiao, it's been hard

327
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,720
for her to be alone.

328
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
But because she loves you,

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
she really wants to

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,880
give birth to a baby for you,

331
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,000
I want to be a good mother,

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,320
boss,

333
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm very confident

334
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
in your treatment.

335
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,440
And I look forward to

336
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,800
seeing you

337
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
take care of your baby one day,

338
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,720
Meng Guo,

339
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,680
thank you.

340
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,840
As a person,

341
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm not very good at

342
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,360
accepting kindness from others,

343
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,840
But for you,

344
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,320
I do have a lot of words

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,360
of gratitude to say,

346
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,680
Boss,

347
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,240
if you want to thank me,

348
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Get better soon.

349
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,080
then

350
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,600
Make the group bigger and stronger,

351
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,760
and give me a promotion and a raise.

352
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,840
To be honest,

353
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,920
I've got news

354
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,680
about James

355
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,760
and I think

356
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,560
I'll be able to find him soon.

357
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,760
Of course,

358
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,600
the good news is not limited to this.

359
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,200
What do you mean?

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,080
If you still

361
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,960
don't want to be hospitalized,

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,640
I'll hold a birthday party

363
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,280
for you

364
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
at home.

365
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:30,960
Miss Lin,

366
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,480
the birthday party she arranged,

367
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,080
For such a trivial matter,

368
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,360
you don't have to do it yourself.

369
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,040
Special Assistant Meng,

370
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,040
are you still worried about me?

371
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
After all,

372
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
if we can find

373
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
the key evidence of James,

374
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:41,960
It's all my offer

375
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,720
to you.

376
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,120
That's why

377
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,200
you invited me

378
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,160
to a birthday party,

379
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,400
That's what I should do.

380
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,200
Of course,

381
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,160
Welcome.

382
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,200
Boss,

383
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,680
we're too busy here.

384
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Open the door.

385
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,720
Xiaoxiao,

386
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
what are you doing here?

387
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,680
Mr. Huo,

388
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
happy birthday to you!

389
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,640
You.

390
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,760
Are you okay?

391
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,040
Everything is fine.

392
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Thank you for your concern,

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,760
Mr. Huo. Strange,

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
Why does Xiaoxiao look like

395
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,680
a different person today.

396
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,200
Mr. Huo,

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,560
at Special Assistant Meng's

398
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
invitation today,

399
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

400
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,720
And

401
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,120
most importantly, of course,

402
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,120
You took good care

403
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,760
of Xiaoxiao before.

404
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,600
The wedding invitation,

405
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,280
I should give it to you myself.

406
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,200
"

407
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,120
get married

408
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,440
Invitation?

409
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,240
Why is it

410
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,560
so fast?

411
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,680
What's wrong?

412
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,920
Is there a problem?

413
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,520
It's okay.

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Congratulations.

415
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Ming Xiao Xiao.

416
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Why are you here?

417
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
You're getting married?

418
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
That's great.

419
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,360
Boss,

420
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,840
I called them here.

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,720
We met

422
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,440
at the resort,

423
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,920
It's boring to have fewer people at the party.

424
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,160
So I

425
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,880
called them here.

426
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,440
You don't want to be welcomed, do you?

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,120
It turns out that

428
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,320
if you really lose someone,

429
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
That's what it feels like.

430
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,560
Thank you.

431
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,600
Come on, Xiaoxiao,

432
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,000
she cann't drink.

433
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,640
It's okay.

434
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,560
I'll do it.

435
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,840
Sorry,

436
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,920
I forgot about you.

437
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm not drunk.

438
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,840
I'm not leaving.

439
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,200
I want to kiss ming

440
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,280
Xiaoxiao, don't go crazy!

441
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,920
Look who I am.

442
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
I know who you are.

443
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Who are you?

444
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,400
Huo Yun Ting,

445
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,400
Mr. Huo,

446
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Just take a good look.

447
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,920
After all, you and Lang Feng

448
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
have sent out wedding invitations,

449
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Mr. Huo,

450
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,760
what are you

451
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,160
talking about?

452
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,640
But,

453
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I have one

454
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,560
important thing.

455
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,760
Don't say anything.

456
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
Don't mention your marriage

457
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,600
to him again.

458
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,240
Ming Xiao,

459
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,560
I don't want to hear anything.

460
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
I just want to tell you,

461
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm sorry,

462
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
I shouldn't have lost you.

463
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,280
Mr. Huo,

464
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
are you jealous?

465
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,960
Regret it?

466
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
It seems that

467
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,440
what Brother Lang Feng said is true.

468
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,920
Boss,

469
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
you love Xiaoxiao so much,

470
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,720
So you have to live a few more days?

471
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,120
Am I right?

472
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,680
That's the only way you can

473
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,800
see her for a few more days,

474
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,040
There's nothing like it.

475
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
Looking at the person you love,

476
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,200
it's better to live

477
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,920
a happy life.

478
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,720
Am I right?

479
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,000
In this world,

480
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,080
there's nothing like saving a drowning man.

481
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,760
And he broke his driftwood with his own hands.

482
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,880
It's even crueler.

483
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,320
I hope she forgets me.

484
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm afraid she'll really forget me.

485
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,760
Meng Guo,

486
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
I think I'm crazy.

487
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,480
I really can't stand it anymore.

488
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,600
I'll get Xiaoxiao back

489
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,320
for you right now.

490
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:03,800
No.

491
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,200
Don't call her back.

492
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,120
It took me a long time

493
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,000
to make it this far,

494
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,280
It took a lot of effort

495
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,160
to set her free.

496
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,400
I can't let her get stuck

497
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
in this mess anymore.

498
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,920
Meng Guo,

499
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,760
you're right.

500
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,720
I should live a few more days.

501
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,640
Make an appointment to go to the hospital.

502
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,520
Okay.

503
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,200
I only watched it secretly for one day.

504
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,120
Meng,

505
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,320
I pulled up all the curtains

506
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,760
of the villa.

507
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll never see

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,880
Mr. Huo again.

509
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,240
Xiaoxiao,

510
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,840
I've thought about it.

511
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,000
This place

512
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,840
is a sad place now.

513
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,920
If you want to leave,

514
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,760
we'll leave

515
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,280
right away.

516
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,200
If you want to stay,

517
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,040
I'll stay here with you.

518
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,280
You can do whatever you want.

519
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,840
You don't have to accept me as your boyfriend,

520
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,800
I just want you to be happy.

521
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,560
Live happily every day.

522
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Brother Lang Feng.

523
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,200
Me,

524
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,960
I'm too stupid

525
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,360
to be your girlfriend.

526
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,520
You shouldn't be

527
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,440
so nice to me.

528
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,480
Because we'll always be

529
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,280
best friends,

530
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,880
Silly girl,

531
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,080
Brother Lang Feng can support you.

532
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,480
But now,

533
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,800
I hope you can

534
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,920
calm down and figure out

535
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,440
what is the most important thing

536
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,400
for you.

537
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
You're an adult now.

538
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,480
You have to understand,

539
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,960
infinite sadness.

540
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
It won't solve the problem.

541
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Only by learning to love yourself first,

542
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,600
can you love others better.

543
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,160
What's the most important thing?

544
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,440
Most importantly.

545
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,480
My piggy bank.

546
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,240
Xiaoxiao,

547
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,200
what are you doing,

548
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,240
Meng Guo and I are going to see

549
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,040
a doctor,

550
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm in a hurry.

551
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,800
Wait for me.

552
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,840
It'll be quick.

553
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,000
Mr. Huo,

554
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,280
my piggy bank is very important.

555
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,280
But you.

556
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,920
More important.

557
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,320
Buy me a new one.

558
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,840
Then I can forget

559
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,080
all the bad things

560
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,080
in the past.

561
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,120
But I'm going to

562
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
give it to you now.

563
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,920
When you see it,

564
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,080
you will think of me.

565
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
Although I don't know

566
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,720
why

567
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,760
you suddenly don't like me,

568
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,080
You don't want to be with me anymore.

569
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,040
But I still

570
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
like you very, very much.

571
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,880
I will try to save money

572
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
in the future,

573
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,640
I'll buy a house

574
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,080
and wait for you to go home.

575
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,400
Xiaoxiao,

576
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,720
come back.

577
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,080
Xiaoxiao,

578
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,080
Meng Guo,

579
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,240
Forget it,

580
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,000
Xiaoxiao, she's not going to stay.

581
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,960
She listened to

582
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,400
everything I said.

583
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,520
Meng Guo,

584
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,680
after I died,

585
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
Scatter my ashes

586
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,480
into the moat,

587
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
If we can surround

588
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
this city forever,

589
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,760
Look at her from afar

590
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,920
and protect her.

591
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm satisfied.

592
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Xiaoxiao,

593
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,440
I have a letter of resignation,

594
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
I can't find it on the table.

595
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,560
Did you see that?

596
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,240
Xiaoxiao,

597
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,960
Xiaoxiao,

598
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,040
What's wrong with you?

599
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:02,960
Oh no.

600
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,440
Mr. Huo

601
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,120
misses Mr. Huo.

602
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,000
Hey,

603
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,720
Huo Yun Ting,

604
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,920
come here.

605
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
Xiaoxiao, she has a high fever.

606
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,000
Let her have

607
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,760
a good sleep here,

608
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,520
I'll be fine tomorrow.

609
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,680
Mr. Huo,

610
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,840
I miss you so much.

611
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,440
Silly girl,

612
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
she can't sleep well these days.

613
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,520
Just stay with her for a while.

614
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,720
Little fool,

615
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,920
you always say you're healthy,

616
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,120
It's powerful.

617
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,320
Actually, I know,

618
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
I failed to

619
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
protect you this time.

620
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
You always say you're a good boy

621
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,600
who's not picky about food,

622
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,600
Actually, I know

623
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,280
you like ice cream and fish the most.

624
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
I hate bitter

625
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,720
gourd and coriander the most,

626
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,000
Everything about you,

627
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,960
I will always remember it.

628
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,160
I won't forget it

629
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,520
until I'm in the grave.

630
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,800
I don't know if I can

631
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,600
find a small fish,

632
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,840
Why are you picking up fish?

633
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,960
If the baby eats more fish,

634
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
he'll become smarter.

635
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,520
We have everything now.

636
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,000
All we need is a smart baby.

637
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay,

638
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
We, Xiaoxiao, can say anything.

639
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,760
Our baby

640
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,800
will be like you,

641
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,240
Cute,

642
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:05,680
Kindness,

643
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,480
No.

644
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,200
The baby needs to be

645
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,920
as smart

646
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,640
as Mr. Huo.

647
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,280
Silly girl.

648
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,200
Our baby,

649
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
of course, looks like the two of us.

650
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,240
What's there to argue about?

651
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,440
Yeah,

652
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,320
we're so stupid.

653
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,680
Xiaoxiao,

654
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,800
Xiaoxiao,

655
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,160
Your fever has just remitted.

656
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
Why did you sneak out?

657
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,120
Xiaoxiao,

658
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
you really scared me.

659
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,880
Do you feel uncomfortable in the future?

660
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,680
Be sure to tell my brother in time.

661
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,240
Do you hear me?

662
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm fine.

663
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,320
Brother Lang Feng,

664
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,080
I just had

665
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,640
a long, long dream.

666
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,560
I dreamed that,

667
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,160
with Mr. Huo,

668
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,320
Let's cook fish together.

669
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
Let's move to a new house together.

670
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,480
And she gave birth to

671
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
a lovely baby.

672
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,400
But I just woke up

673
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
and realized

674
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
it was a dream.

675
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,800
Xiaoxiao,

676
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,160
if you keep dreaming about someone,

677
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,640
It's time

678
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,120
to say

679
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
goodbye to him.

680
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,320
I don't understand

681
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
why love disappears?

682
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,840
Why do you have to say goodbye?

683
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
If you have a fever

684
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,080
and dream about Mr. Huo,

685
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,200
I'm willing to get sick every day.

686
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,240
Xiaoxiao,

687
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,480
wake up,

688
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,960
Huo Yun Ting separated from you,

689
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,760
not because he doesn't love you,

690
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,800
but

691
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
He has a lot of problems,

692
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,000
but he can't solve them.

693
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
Every adult has

694
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,160
his own problems to solve.

695
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,840
Since you've grown up,

696
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,200
since you love him,

697
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
Give him enough time.

698
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,880
Let him solve these problems.

699
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,240
Okay?

700
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,200
Okay,

701
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
I will try my best to do it.

702
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,120
I'll wait for Mr. Huo

703
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,960
to come back.

704
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,160
All right,

705
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,560
I've been crying for an hour.

706
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,720
I didn't give you a hard time

707
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,400
when you quit.

708
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
You're such a big man,

709
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,000
how can you do such a small thing?

710
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,320
How infatuated is Ming Xiaoxiao?

711
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
I wonder if they'll

712
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,200
see each other again?

713
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,440
I can't imagine

714
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,720
what would happen

715
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,480
if Xiaoxiao left Huo Yunting?

716
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,720
Lang Feng,

717
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
I really can't understand you.

718
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,520
Huo Yun Ting has sent

719
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,840
Ming Xiao Xiao to you.

720
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,400
Aren't you going to take love?

721
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,880
Forget it.

722
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,320
I can't believe you said

723
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,200
such stupid things,

724
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,520
Of course I love her.

725
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,040
But because I love her,

726
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,640
I want her to be good.

727
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,920
Yes

728
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,480
Huo Yun Ting

729
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,360
may not be a good person,

730
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,080
But he's a good lover.

731
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,440
So I can't

732
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,920
let my obsession and prejudice.

733
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,760
Break them up.

734
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,280
Otherwise my conscience

735
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,120
will be disturbed

736
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
by conscience and love,

737
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,280
I haven't seen it

738
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,000
for a long time.

739
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,800
But,

740
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,240
haven't we all

741
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,960
seen each other now?

742
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,560
Miss Lin,

743
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,840
spare yourself.

744
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,800
I want Xiaoxiao to be happy.

745
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
I hope you can have a good life.

746
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Even though you're going to be

747
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,920
Mrs. Huo,

748
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,480
But will you really be happy?

749
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,480
Lang Feng, what do you mean?

750
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,320
I'm going to be

751
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,920
Mrs. Huo,

752
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,600
How could I not be happy?

753
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,320
Get lost!

754
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,040
Get out of here right now!

755
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,400
Right away.

756
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:19,960
Boss,

757
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,680
now that Xiaoxiao

758
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,560
has made a clear investigation.

759
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,360
If you're fine,

760
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,960
just go to

761
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,720
the hospital.

762
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,080
Meng Guo,

763
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,240
do you think I made a mistake

764
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,680
and pretended to marry Lin Xi?

765
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,440
Force Xiaoxiao to leave.

766
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,880
I thought she would live a better life.

767
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,040
But unexpectedly,

768
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,440
she suffered so much,

769
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That's why I didn't approve of you

770
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,040
breaking up from the very beginning.

771
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,080
All you see is that

772
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,880
after Xiaoxiao left you,

773
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,920
She's in a lot of pain.

774
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,840
But no one knows that

775
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,000
all these pains

776
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,240
will bite back on you.

777
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,800
Boss,

778
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,320
neither you

779
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,640
nor Xiaoxiao

780
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,560
deserves this pain.

781
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,240
I didn't expect that I'd be

782
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,480
so indecisive one day,

783
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,160
People,

784
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,280
with love,

785
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,880
There will be worries.

786
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,120
There's a weakness,

787
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,160
it seems,

788
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,360
No one can escape.

789
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,640
Not only that,

790
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,000
love makes people vulnerable.

791
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,480
But love also makes people strong.

792
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,120
You see,

793
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,080
Xiaoxiao, it's been hard

794
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,880
for her to be alone.

795
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,680
But because she loves you,

796
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,160
she really wants to

797
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,040
give birth to a baby for you,

798
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,160
I want to be a good mother,

799
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,480
boss,

800
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm very confident

801
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,120
in your treatment.

802
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,600
And I look forward to

803
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:35,960
seeing you

804
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,560
take care of your baby one day,

805
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,880
Meng Guo,

806
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:39,840
thank you.

807
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,000
As a person,

808
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,880
I'm not very good at

809
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,520
accepting kindness from others,

810
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,000
But for you,

811
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,480
I do have a lot of words

812
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,520
of gratitude to say,

813
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,840
Boss,

814
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,400
if you want to thank me,

815
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,280
Get better soon.

816
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,240
then

817
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,760
Make the group bigger and stronger,

818
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,920
and give me a promotion and a raise.

819
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,000
To be honest,

820
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,080
I've got news

821
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,840
about James

822
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:00,920
and I think

823
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,720
I'll be able to find him soon.

824
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:02,920
Of course,

825
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,760
the good news is not limited to this.

826
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,360
What do you mean?

827
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,240
If you still

828
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,120
don't want to be hospitalized,

829
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,800
I'll hold a birthday party

830
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,440
for you

831
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
at home.

832
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,120
Miss Lin,

833
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,640
the birthday party she arranged,

834
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,240
For such a trivial matter,

835
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,520
you don't have to do it yourself.

836
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,200
Special Assistant Meng,

837
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,200
are you still worried about me?

838
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,480
After all,

839
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,680
if we can find

840
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,560
the key evidence of James,

841
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,120
It's all my offer

842
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,880
to you.

843
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,280
That's why

844
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,360
you invited me

845
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,320
to a birthday party,

846
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,560
That's what I should do.

847
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,360
Of course,

848
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,320
Welcome.

849
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,360
Boss,

850
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,840
we're too busy here.

851
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Open the door.

852
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,880
Xiaoxiao,

853
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,040
what are you doing here?

854
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,840
Mr. Huo,

855
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,080
happy birthday to you!

856
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,800
You.

857
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,920
Are you okay?

858
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,200
Everything is fine.

859
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
Thank you for your concern,

860
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,920
Mr. Huo. Strange,

861
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,080
Why does Xiaoxiao look like

862
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,840
a different person today.

863
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,360
Mr. Huo,

864
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,720
at Special Assistant Meng's

865
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,920
invitation today,

866
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,080
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

867
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:17,880
And

868
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,280
most importantly, of course,

869
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,280
You took good care

870
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,920
of Xiaoxiao before.

871
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,760
The wedding invitation,

872
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,440
I should give it to you myself.

873
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,360
"

874
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,280
get married

875
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,600
Invitation?

876
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,400
Why is it

877
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,720
so fast?

878
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:31,840
What's wrong?

879
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,080
Is there a problem?

880
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,680
It's okay.

881
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,200
Congratulations.

882
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,280
Ming Xiao Xiao.

883
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,760
Why are you here?

884
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,160
You're getting married?

885
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,960
That's great.

886
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,520
Boss,

887
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,000
I called them here.

888
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,880
We met

889
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,600
at the resort,

890
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,080
It's boring to have fewer people at the party.

891
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,320
So I

892
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,040
called them here.

893
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,600
You don't want to be welcomed, do you?

894
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,280
It turns out that

895
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,480
if you really lose someone,

896
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
That's what it feels like.

897
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:47,720
Thank you.

898
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,760
Come on, Xiaoxiao,

899
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,160
she cann't drink.

900
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:08,800
It's okay.

901
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:09,720
I'll do it.

902
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,000
Sorry,

903
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,080
I forgot about you.
