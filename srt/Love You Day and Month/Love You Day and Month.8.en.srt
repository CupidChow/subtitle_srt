1
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,200
The evidence I have

2
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
Is much more than that.

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,360
Yellow gambling drugs

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
You can do either.

5
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
To make you never turn over.

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,320
therefore

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,200
You'd better not mess with me.

8
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,320
Don't mess with President Huo.

9
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,480
It's all my fault.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,880
I confess.

11
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,720
but

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,440
I was forced to.

13
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,640
President Huo.

14
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,440
Miss Lin,

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,360
Please.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Leave me alone.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,280
Xiaoxiao

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,320
My good sister.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Please help me.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
So Fenfen

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,800
You really stole the money.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,440
To frame me on purpose?

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
I know I was wrong.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,160
can

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,400
I have no choice.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,200
If you can't get the money,

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
He will beat me to death.

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Miss Liu,

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:10,840
people

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,680
There are many ways to die.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
You have plenty of chances.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
You can try it.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
Xiaoxiao

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
Please help me.

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,360
Please help me.

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,280
Mr. Huo,

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,160
This matter

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,240
Can I handle it myself?

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,240
You handle it.

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,800
Can you do that?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Alright, Xiao Xiao.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
About yourself.

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,600
You can handle it yourself.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Fenfen

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,240
I know.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,560
Sometimes,

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,160
You hate me a little bit.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,960
but

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,320
I really have

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,560
As a good friend.

51
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
You brought me food.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,840
When the manager scolded me,

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,160
You would hide with me.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Mr. Huo said

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,240
friend

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,000
Like the stars on the sky every day.

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,600
But I have very few friends.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
therefore

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
They are as precious as stars.

60
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
But now,

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
You're not my friend anymore.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,120
Fenfen

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,520
Leave.

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,280
it doesn't matter

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,920
Xiao Xiao,

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,520
There will be more in the future.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
A more precious friend.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Mr. Huo,

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,920
Xiaoxiao

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,480
to be sorry

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,080
I got the wrong person.

72
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,720
Miss Lin,

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,040
Why are you here?

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,120
Where is my Xiao Xiao?

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
You're suddenly ill.

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Has been unconscious for three days.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Xiao Xiao,

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Because I was too worried about you.

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
And fainted from crying.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Now he's in the hospital.

81
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,080
what

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,840
Xiao Xiao,

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,160
How could it be?

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Ms. Meng will take care of her.

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,400
If you go there like this,

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Will delay her treatment.

87
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,480
I'll let you know if there's any news.

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,120
Don't worry.

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,760
You're right.

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,920
I didn't think it through.

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,520
Meng Guo didn't come back

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
And sent me to the hospital.

93
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,720
To keep it a secret.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,360
I can't take down the platform myself.

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,360
Miss Lin,

96
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,960
You've got it now.

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
My biggest secret

98
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
Stay here and take care of me.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,600
I should thank you.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,320
President Huo.

101
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,240
If you want to thank me,

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
How about being sincere?

103
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,440
Huo Yunting

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Marry me

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Do you know?

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,960
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Miss Lin,

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,080
I appreciate it.

109
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
How many times did you help?

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,320
But this is the credit.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,280
It's not enough.

112
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,160
Let Huo Yunting

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Sell yourself.

114
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm not selling myself.

115
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a strong alliance.

116
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
If I am right,

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,000
Huo Fenglei

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
To unite the United States.

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,720
Dawson Company

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,520
And went short.

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
The stock of Huo Group

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,800
And my participation

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,320
To a great extent,

124
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
To stabilize the shareholders.

125
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,240
And the market's mood.

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,880
To support the Huo family.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,320
therefore

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,960
I sincerely advise you

129
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Think about marrying me.

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,120
Of course

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
That's not the most important thing.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
It's all for Ming Xiao.

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,920
For Xiao Xiao,

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,840
What do you mean?

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Frankly, President Huo,

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
I really admire you.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,760
I also know

138
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
You love Ming Xiao Xiao.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,720
So,

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,880
I don't want to force you.

141
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
But as you can see,

142
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,880
It's only because of the illness,

143
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
I was unconscious for a few more days.

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Ming Xiao Xiao,

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
You can cry and pass out.

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,080
She's so simple-minded.

147
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
Once I identify you,

148
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
You are her whole world.

149
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,640
If it's a short time,

150
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
Your condition continues to get worse.

151
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,760
even

152
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,960
to die

153
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,240
What will happen to her?

154
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,080
She can afford it.

155
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,040
Such a heavy blow?

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
When the world

157
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,360
No one else

158
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Love her as you do.

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,640
To protect her,

160
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,040
She will only be

161
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Even more miserable.

162
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
It's better to end it as soon as possible.

163
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,000
Timely stop.

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,560
Maybe she cried and cried.

165
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
I was taken care of by Lang Feng for a period of time.

166
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
And then recovered?

167
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,840
I won't.

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
Even without me,

169
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,960
Her life after that,

170
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,960
And live a happy life.

171
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,960
happy

172
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
Huo Yunting

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,680
Can you...

174
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Don't be so selfish.

175
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
The deeper you love now,

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,840
From now on, her heart

177
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
The deeper the injury will be.

178
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
As a woman,

179
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm more capable than you.

180
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,960
Imagine her feelings.

181
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,240
Huo Yunting

182
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Marry me.

183
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,600
Let Xiao Xiao go to treat him early.

184
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,240
I will help you.

185
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
I just want to

186
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Mrs. Huo's reputation.

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,520
We're married to the outside world.

188
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
Is not really getting married.

189
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,240
you

190
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
Since you didn't betray your heart,

191
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,160
It can be used

192
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
Continue to love that girl.

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,680
Isn't it good?

194
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,520
perhaps

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
And set her free.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,240
Is the real love.

197
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,080
Miss Lin,

198
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,320
Thank you for helping me last time.

199
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,040
Thank you for

200
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,440
To escort me home.

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,200
Mr. Huo said

202
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,160
You should treat those who have helped you

203
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,640
And be grateful.

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
therefore

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,520
I saved it specially.

206
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,800
This candy is for you.

207
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,800
It's so sweet.

208
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,800
Xiaoxiao

209
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm here to pick you up today.

210
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
To talk to you about something.

211
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,880
Alright.

212
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,880
What's wrong?

213
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,680
However

214
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
It seems that

215
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Not back.

216
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,520
The way to Mr. Huo's house?

217
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,760
Xiaoxiao

218
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,200
From now on,

219
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,760
You will move to

220
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
My other apartment.

221
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,560
Your brother Long Feng lives there too.

222
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
You will be happy.

223
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,040
but

224
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,480
Mr. Huo and I are now

225
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,400
And live together.

226
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm so happy.

227
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,560
I don't want to move.

228
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,680
Let's stop talking.

229
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,760
Now,

230
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Very, very much.

231
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,600
To see Mr. Huo.

232
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
Since he fell ill last time,

233
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,440
I haven't met him yet.

234
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,200
Let's go.

235
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,120
MingXiaoxiao

236
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
Huo Yunting is getting married.

237
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,240
You can't stay with him anymore.

238
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
It's not that fast.

239
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
Mr. Huo and I

240
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
You're still in a relationship.

241
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,000
We're going first.

242
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
Take wedding photographs

243
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
And pay the bill.

244
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
To get married again.

245
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,200
You are being paranoid

246
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
I'm the one who married Huo Yunting.

247
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm the bride.

248
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,920
therefore

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,800
You must leave him.

250
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,040
You lied to me.

251
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
Mr. Huo said that.

252
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,680
He wants to marry me.

253
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,720
We are going to have a lot of babies.

254
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Will have a home.

255
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Will be very happy.

256
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,880
MingXiaoxiao

257
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Don't look at those lies.

258
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,040
The children's fairy tales, okay?

259
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,160
It's here.

260
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
The prince has no Cinderella.

261
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,520
Only the princess

262
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,960
And that princess can only be me.

263
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,760
you

264
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,360
You're not even Cinderella.

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
A longer sentence.

266
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
You can't explain it clearly.

267
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,400
How can I be Mrs. Huo?

268
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,760
Are you good enough for Huo Yunting?

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,720
I won't listen.

270
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160
You're wrong.

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,080
Mr. Huo is still at home.

272
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Wait for me.

273
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,240
Miss Lin,

274
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,200
I will never

275
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't want to see you anymore.

276
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
Look at us.

277
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
She looks like she's going to take wedding photos.

278
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,000
A newly married couple.

279
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,240
You're not even Cinderella.

280
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
A longer sentence.

281
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,200
You can't explain it clearly.

282
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
How can I be Mrs. Huo?

283
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
Are you good enough for Huo Yunting?

284
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,560
I won't.

285
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,600
Xiaoxiao

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
You should trust Mr. Huo.

287
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,600
Yes

288
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,240
Ask him about it.

289
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,560
This is Miss Lin.

290
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,480
A custom-made wedding ring.

291
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
She was buying a banquet.

292
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,560
Wedding photos, honeymoons,

293
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,600
Has been completed.

294
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,960
I don't have to worry about it.

295
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,800
She's very thoughtful.

296
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,520
But after that,

297
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Don't forget the procedure.

298
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,280
As long as I release

299
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,920
That's enough information.

300
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,200
although

301
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,480
You've reached an agreement.

302
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,200
But boss,

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,560
Are you really going to

304
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,280
Is Lin Xi getting married?

305
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,120
that

306
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,280
What about Xiao Xiao?

307
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,960
Xiaoxiao

308
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm sorry to her.

309
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
Mr. Huo, what's wrong with you?

310
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Why are you

311
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
To marry someone suddenly.

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Did I do something wrong?

313
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,200
To make you angry.

314
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,680
It's been a long time.

315
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
I really miss you.

316
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,360
Ting Ting.

317
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't be angry, okay?

318
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
We agreed that

319
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,560
To get married.

320
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
A lot of cute babies.

321
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,120
Don't regret it.

322
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,040
My Xiao Xiao.

323
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
I really hate myself.

324
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,880
but

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm really sorry.

326
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Love is not an easy thing.

327
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm really fed up.

328
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Enough.

329
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,920
What do you mean?

330
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,080
Namely

331
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,040
I hate your meaning.

332
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,080
You are stupid and stupid.

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
I don't want to play with you anymore.

334
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,520
MingXiaoxiao

335
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,280
Let's break up

336
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,160
Mr. Huo,

337
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,640
Open the door.

338
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,560
I know I'm stupid.

339
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,840
But I will definitely

340
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
I will study hard.

341
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
To get better.

342
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,160
Don't be disgusted.

343
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,040
How are you?

344
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,120
What Miss Lin can do,

345
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,840
I can study hard.

346
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
As long as you teach me,

347
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
I will definitely learn it well.

348
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,480
MingXiaoxiao

349
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,840
Leave.

350
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,720
I won't see you again.

351
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,920
Mr. Huo,

352
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,480
I told you,

353
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
I won't leave you.

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,040
If you don't open the door,

355
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,840
I've been here all the time.

356
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
Until you come out to see me.

357
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,840
My little fool.

358
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,160
If possible

359
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,560
I wish I could

360
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,680
To marry you.

361
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,720
but

362
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
I don't have the chance.

363
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,560
You're really cruel.

364
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,640
See?

365
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,000
And fell asleep.

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,760
You don't care.

367
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,880
I still feel sorry for you.

368
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Give her the food.

369
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm not hungry.

370
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,320
Xiaoxiao

371
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Xiaoxiao

372
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,280
Wake

373
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Get up and eat something.

374
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
No more.

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not hungry.

376
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,960
Let me sleep for a while.

377
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,760
The floor is cold.

378
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Why don't you sleep in the room?

379
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm not going.

380
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
I'm waiting for Mr. Huo.

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,360
Meng Guo.

382
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,240
Leave.

383
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,280
Mr. Huo,

384
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
You finally opened the door.

385
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,160
Can I...

386
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,680
Don't dislike me.

387
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,160
I know I'm a little stupid.

388
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,280
But I know

389
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,000
I have

390
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,720
How much I like you.

391
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,480
Can I...

392
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Don't break up with me.

393
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,240
Xiaoxiao

394
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,360
You've grown up.

395
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,760
Without me,

396
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,160
That's why...

397
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
And become a better person.

398
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,120
And live a happier life.

399
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,920
therefore

400
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,360
We should act like

401
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
Mature adults.

402
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
And break up peacefully.

403
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Say goodbye.

404
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
Little pig.

405
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,440
It's so hard to be in love.

406
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,320
But what should we do?

407
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
I really like Mr. Huo.

408
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,040
I hope he will come out later.

409
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
I can understand when I see you.

410
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,680
I can make money.

411
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,720
You can be like an adult.

412
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,960
Live a good life.

413
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,720
MingXiaoxiao

414
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,920
It's useless.

415
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,640
Why are you here?

416
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't want to see you now.

417
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,120
Hurry up and leave.
