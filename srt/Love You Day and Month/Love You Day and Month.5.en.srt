1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,760
Longfeng

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,880
The other only knows how to study.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,680
A brat.

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't quite understand what you mean.

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,280
I know.

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
As a new intern,

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
I must have many

9
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Where progress is needed.

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,160
but

11
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,520
It's not as bad as you said.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
You want to tell me

13
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,280
You're the president of the Student Union.

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Outstanding graduates.

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
I have these titles.

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,320
Not to be worth a hair

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,400
I know.

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,840
People say you're

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
The best in the school.

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
A good student.

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
But in my opinion,

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,680
You're a coward.

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
A coward without creativity.

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,640
Even the girl you like

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I dare not fight for it.

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,560
you

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,480
How do you know?

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,960
Who do I like?

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,680
wrong

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,440
Mr. Lin,

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,480
You investigated me.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,200
Don't be surprised.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
I have many ways.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,640
means

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Is far beyond your imagination.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,680
But that's not important.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
No matter what kind of person you are,

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Since I chose you,

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,120
that

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,600
Your good day.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,280
Is coming.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,320
Longfeng

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,240
To be my personal assistant.

44
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
To be driven by me.

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,040
MingXiaoxiao

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,680
It's yours.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,760
Mr. Lin,

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,080
I don't know

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,880
What can I do?

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
I can be your special assistant.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,360
but

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
If you take Xiao Xiao,

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
To negotiate with me.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,760
Sorry, I can't.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Ming Xiao Xiao,

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,760
To climb the high branch.

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
She and the Huo Group

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,240
President Huo.

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,160
Is ambiguous.

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
If you want Ming Xiao Xiao

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
Back to you.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,120
and

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,680
And get another treatment.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,840
It's a good job.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
Then cut the crap.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Listen to me.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
Are you really fine?

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,240
It's okay. Why are you here?

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,760
Are you feeling well?

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Didn't you see it?

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,760
I don't know.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,200
You really care about me.

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes?

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
Second Uncle, he's old.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,720
I won't lock you up.

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
To let you out.

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
It's useless.

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Go ahead.

79
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Why are you here?

80
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,800
before

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,960
How can I find you?

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,920
There's no sign of him.

83
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,520
Now I'm anxious and anxious.

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
To urge me here.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,320
I really think I'm a delivery boy.

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
You're always on call.

87
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
It's nothing serious.

88
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,080
I want you to send a message.

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Open the record.

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,480
Listen carefully.

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,400
Meng Guo.

92
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
What do you mean?

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,800
You're here.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,720
It's nothing.

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,640
But you have to think about it.

96
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,400
Your mother.

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,880
To take care of a partially disabled person.

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,080
And cancer patients.

99
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,840
It's not easy.

100
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,000
but

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
The situation of our family.

102
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,080
Is a bottomless pit.

103
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
You can't fill it out.

104
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:09,960
Hum

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,000
Meng Guo.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
What do you mean?

107
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,280
You're here.

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,160
It's nothing.

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,480
But you have to think about it.

110
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,360
Your mother.

111
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,040
To take care of a partially disabled person.

112
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,320
And cancer patients.

113
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
It's not easy.

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,920
but

115
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,640
The situation of our family.

116
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Is a bottomless pit.

117
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,720
You can't fill it out.

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,880
Hum

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,200
Don't worry about this.

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,560
After all, my father

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,520
Second Master of the Huo Family.

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,280
For so many years,

123
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,200
In the Huo family,

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
You won more than that.

125
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,040
money

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
From now on,

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,440
The most worthless thing.

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,120
Go back and tell me.

129
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,920
Behave yourself.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Vice President of Huo Group.

131
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,320
There's only one more.

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Without him,

133
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,600
As for you,

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
If you don't want to be

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
A place of confinement.

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
To a high-walled power grid.

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,120
I'll never...

138
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
To appear here.

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,680
Boss

140
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,680
What's wrong with you?

141
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
You're always absent-minded.

142
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
The corners of your mouth are still rising.

143
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Is it the spirit?

144
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,440
What's wrong?

145
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
What can I do?

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,200
She's from the company.

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,880
Those trifles?

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Work hard.

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,880
Don't watch me.

150
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280
Then I know.

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
Are you worried about the company?

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,200
That's why I was so distracted.

153
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
But Xiao Xiao has been

154
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,960
Are you absent-minded?

155
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Not only that,

156
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,800
I've been working with her

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
Mention your name.

158
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
She reacted strongly.

159
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,960
You know,

160
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
What is the reason?

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,840
what

162
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,920
You know,

163
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,400
What's wrong with Xiao Xiao?

164
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,320
She didn't want to

165
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Do you hear my name?

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
Boss, you have exposed yourself.

167
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:20,920
Say it.

168
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,080
Are you...

169
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
And fall in love with Xiao.

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,920
Okay, Meng Guo.

171
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,960
How dare you lie to me?

172
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,280
I was wrong.

173
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,800
Then make up for it.

174
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,320
How about this?

175
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
You asked me to look for him.

176
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,160
About Xiao Xiao.

177
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,320
Just now,

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Forget about it.

179
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,040
That's more like it.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,760
Are you asking me

181
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Fall in love with her.

182
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,240
actually

183
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
I don't know.

184
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,760
What do you like?

185
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,760
perhaps

186
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
I just feel sorry for her.

187
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,960
The same as me.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
And become a man.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Alright

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,560
When did you

191
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
So as to be enlightened.

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,320
Boss

193
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,560
This is an acquisition plan.

194
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
The Lin family's plan

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,040
I need your signature.

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,520
Once the signal is released,

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
There will be a good show.

198
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,000
The Lin clan moved to Huo Feng Lei.

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,400
It's cost-effective.

200
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:21,880
Correct!

201
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
The stray cats outside

202
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Have you bought the cat litter?

203
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,400
Make it clear with the property management.

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,600
It's my adopted cat.

205
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't drive them away.

206
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
I've already arranged it.

207
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,280
It's rare for you

208
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Be gentle and thoughtful once.

209
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
I must cooperate actively.

210
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,560
What are you thinking?

211
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm old.

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
For health,

213
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,200
So I want to be more virtuous.

214
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,680
Brother Meng.

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,200
Mr. Huo,

216
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,200
I saw it outside.

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,120
There are so many beautiful cat houses.

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
The kittens have a home.

219
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,800
Xiao Xiao, I'm glad you like it.

220
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,040
These cat houses

221
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,280
But Mr. Huo chose

222
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,480
I picked it up in one night.

223
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,480
You're so picky.

224
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,920
Really

225
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Mr. Huo,

226
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
It's you who gave the kittens

227
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
A gift?

228
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,360
You're so kind.

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I just picked it up.

230
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,560
You can have a look.

231
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
That cat is your favorite.

232
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,840
On its cat badge,

233
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,320
And engraved your name.

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,200
Boss

235
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
You'll be spreading dog food.

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Be careful, okay?

237
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm a single dog.

238
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
I want to live two more days.

239
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Rats, screw you

240
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,840
Go to work.

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Xiaoxiao

242
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
We meet again.

243
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
Why are you carrying so many things?

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,720
Let me help you.

245
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
Pretty sister, it's you.

246
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,040
Thank you.

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,240
you're welcome

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,760
It's you.

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
These things

250
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
It's available in the park every day.

251
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,560
And the housekeeper sent them to you.

252
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Why are you taking it yourself?

253
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
Mr. Huo,

254
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,600
he

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't like strangers.

256
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,440
Go home.

257
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,920
and

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,560
He's a picky eater.

259
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
His requirements for ingredients

260
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,720
Are different.

261
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,080
Others

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,040
I don't know.

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,240
therefore

264
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Or me?

265
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,600
Pick them yourself.

266
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,640
It's better.

267
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,040
So you and Mr. Huo

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,600
Are you close?

269
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,800
Should

270
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,360
That's good.

271
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:27,760
but

272
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,240
His temper

273
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,160
So weird.

274
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,680
sometimes

275
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,640
He will.

276
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm very happy.

277
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,600
Sometimes suddenly,

278
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,200
Super angry.

279
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,320
but

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm giving in to him.

281
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
Because Brother Meng said

282
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,040
That Mr. Huo

283
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
She's not well.

284
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
mind

285
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
It's not good.

286
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
therefore

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,880
I want to help him.

288
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,720
And love him.

289
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
You're really a good girl.

290
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,360
No wonder Lang Feng likes you so much.

291
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,520
sister

292
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,360
You know Brother Long Feng?

293
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,000
That's right.

294
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
We are very good friends.

295
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,120
Really?

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,000
Now?

297
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,320
You are also my good friend.

298
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,440
that

299
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
I can

300
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,360
To visit you often?

301
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,280
MingXiaoxiao

302
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,760
Buy a vegetable.

303
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,360
Why is it so long?

304
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,040
I thought

305
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,440
You were kidnapped.

306
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,480
Come here.

307
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,200
Mr. Huo,

308
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
I made a new friend.

309
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,600
You can make her

310
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,560
Are you coming to our home?

311
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
It's a bit messy at home.

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,280
not as good as

313
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Let's go to the beach.

314
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,840
Are you going to the beach?

315
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
But your body

316
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,320
Let's go secretly.

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
I won't tell Meng Guo.

318
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,600
Mr. Huo and Xiao Xiao are really close.

319
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,360
She looks

320
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
But she's not like a nanny at all.

321
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,480
This is my private affair.

322
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Miss Lin,

323
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
You can tell me what you want to say.

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,800
I received a letter

325
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,720
For the acquisition contract.

326
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,240
Simply put,

327
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Thank you, President Huo, for

328
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
To help the Lin clan.

329
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
So I offered to help.

330
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
The evidence in it is on you.

331
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,480
To deal with Huo Feng Lei and his son,

332
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
I think I can help.

333
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
Thank you for your kindness.

334
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
But these things

335
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
Meng Guo can handle it himself.

336
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,960
Don't worry, Mr. Huo.

337
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
I brought this today.

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,600
Not to make you appreciate it.

339
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,960
Huo Feng Lei and his son offended me.

340
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm

341
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
Has always held a grudge.

342
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,480
therefore

343
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
We share a common hatred.

344
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,480
Of course

345
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,120
I know.

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:58,960
The Huo family.

347
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Are not good at anything.

348
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,600
but

349
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
I'd rather believe you.

350
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,480
I admire you more.

351
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Don't mind.

352
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,760
Once and for all,

353
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,560
Be cold-shouldered

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,640
I really appreciate it.

355
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,480
Miss Lin's taste

356
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,440
But I hope you can focus your energy

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
Focus on the cooperation between the two families.

358
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,520
Also

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,160
Please don't be alone in the future.

360
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
To chat with Xiao Xiao outside.

361
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,000
Her idea is simple.

362
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
It's easy to

363
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,680
As good friends.

364
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,120
If one day,

365
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Was really kidnapped.

366
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
That would be bad.

367
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,640
Pretty sister.

368
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,080
I picked up a lot of beautiful shells.

369
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,800
Can I give it to you?

370
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
It's really beautiful.

371
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,960
Thank you, Xiao Xiao.

372
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,080
I know, Mr. Huo.

373
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,760
I'll put together a list of

374
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,400
Of the Lin Group.

375
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,760
Inside the top secret information sent.

376
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,720
Looking forward to cooperation.

377
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,240
5

378
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,200
4

379
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,680
3

380
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:00,880
2

381
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,400
1

382
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
The son of a bitch's Meng Yue

383
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Come out.

384
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,520
Meng Guo.

385
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Boss

386
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,040
Come out now.

387
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,600
As you expected,

388
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,480
They're really here.

389
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,640
Go and have a look.

390
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,800
You came back here?

391
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,960
Should be more than...

392
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,240
Lord Huo is a fool.

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,280
good

394
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,000
Second Young Master.

395
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,920
Why are you here?

396
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,960
Is there anything wrong with the company?

397
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,360
The son of a bitch's Meng Yue

398
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,040
Are you trying to fool me again?

399
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,800
You gave Huo Yunting

400
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,520
What's the wind?

401
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,560
Why is he suddenly

402
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,360
Fire our father and son.

403
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,800
Where did he get those?

404
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,720
A mess of evidence.

405
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,520
I think you're tired of living.

406
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,280
That's it.

407
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,480
Shut up.

408
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,440
Meng,

409
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,080
Second Uncle hasn't seen Yun Ting for a long time.

410
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,280
Thank you.

411
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,960
Let me know.

412
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:46,880
please

413
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,960
Huo Yunting, what are you?

414
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,920
The Crown Prince.

415
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,720
Be quiet.

416
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm talking to the chairman.

417
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,320
Talk about work.

418
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,760
What's the big deal?

419
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,280
Thank you, Second Uncle.

420
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
To come here.

421
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,200
Yunting.

422
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
You two brothers

423
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,760
Breaking bones and tendons.

424
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,280
I used to fight a lot.

425
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,640
It's okay.

426
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Why are you taking it suddenly?

427
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,760
The company is talking about it.

428
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,480
I'm a veteran of three dynasties.

429
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
She's old.

430
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,360
It's useless.

431
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
You can forget about me.

432
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,240
But the Crown Prince is your real brother.

433
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,960
You did such a great job.

434
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
I went underground.

435
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
But how can I be with the Huo family?

436
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,040
My ancestors, my forefathers.

437
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Second Uncle.

438
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,480
It's not you.

439
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,480
For so many years,

440
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
How can you speak and act?

441
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,720
You are so fake.

442
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,440
Why would I do that?

443
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,840
Didn't Lord Huo tell you why?

444
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Or maybe

445
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
You made it before.

446
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
Those disgusting things.

447
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,720
You really treat others

448
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
Can't you find any evidence?

449
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
Listen to my advice.

450
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
If you don't want to be sad,

451
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,480
You can retire early.

452
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,320
Find a place where there's no one.

453
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,440
Take care of yourself.

454
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,600
And raise a fart.

455
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,880
All my father's assets

456
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,960
Are frozen by you.

457
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,520
Enough

458
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,720
Huo Yunting

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,320
everything

460
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
To give yourself a way out.

461
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,880
If I

462
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,800
I won't leave it.

463
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,600
You will regret it.

464
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
I would never...

465
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,360
Meng Guo.

466
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,160
Second Uncle's gray account in the Caymans

467
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,160
And the assets of all the mistresses.

468
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,360
Have you found out everything?

469
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,240
yes

470
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,520
All the evidence

471
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,480
Has been recorded.

472
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
The bad guys will be punished eventually.

473
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,360
Yunting

474
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:46,840
you

475
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
What do you want Second Uncle to do?

476
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,000
So that you can spare me.

477
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,280
Or

478
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,280
Kneel down.

479
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,120
To give me and my dead

480
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
Mother, please acknowledge your mistake.

481
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,880
perhaps

482
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm softhearted.

483
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,720
Huo Yuanting

484
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,400
I didn't kill you last time.

485
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
You're lucky.

486
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,880
Master Huo.

487
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,160
Let go

488
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
What are you talking about?

489
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,240
Let's go.

490
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Huo Yunting

491
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,520
Don't forget that

492
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,440
A lean camel.

493
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Bigger than Ma.

494
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,320
No matter what,

495
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm also your second uncle.

496
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,200
Our uncle and nephew

497
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
Just give it a try.

498
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,840
Huo Yunting

499
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,160
Wait for me.

500
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,560
Boss

501
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,800
Is this revenge?

502
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,080
Everything has just begun.

503
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm waiting to see

504
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,480
The day they went to hell,

505
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,840
By the way, Meng Guo,

506
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Get me James.

507
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,320
As soon as possible.

508
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,520
A comprehensive pre-treatment physical examination

509
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,320
For a physical examination.

510
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,280
treatment

511
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,320
Boss

512
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,680
you

513
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,520
You want to open it?

514
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,840
What's the fuss about?

515
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
I've almost recovered.

516
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,400
I just want to have a physical examination.

517
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,720
Instead of being kidnapped by Ming Xiao,

518
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Why don't I go on my own?

519
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
The power of love is great.

520
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,120
What are you talking about?

521
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,760
What? Am I wrong, boss?

522
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,560
Between you and Xiao Xiao,

523
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,960
is or isn't

524
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,520
Are you right?

525
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,400
And then I hit you.

526
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:15,840
Alright.

527
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,480
I won't talk about it.

528
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,640
Stop it, alright?

529
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,760
You're too late.

530
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
Huo Yunting's entire internal organs

531
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,720
Is very weak.

532
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,680
Even with my treatment,

533
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,480
There is only a 5% chance of success.

534
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,040
money

535
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,160
From now on,

536
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,440
The most worthless thing.

537
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,120
Go back and tell me.

538
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Behave yourself.

539
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,280
Vice President of Huo Group.

540
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,320
There's only one more.

541
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Without him,

542
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,600
As for you,

543
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,840
If you don't want to be

544
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,880
A place of confinement.

545
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,360
To a high-walled power grid.

546
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,120
I'll never...

547
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
To appear here.

548
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,680
Boss

549
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,680
What's wrong with you?

550
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,880
You're always absent-minded.

551
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
The corners of your mouth are still rising.

552
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,320
Is it the spirit?

553
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,440
What's wrong?

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
What can I do?

555
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,200
She's from the company.

556
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,880
Those trifles?

557
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,680
Work hard.

558
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,880
Don't watch me.

559
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,280
Then I know.

560
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,400
Are you worried about the company?

561
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,200
That's why I was so distracted.

562
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,720
But Xiao Xiao has been

563
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,960
Are you absent-minded?

564
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,600
Not only that,

565
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,800
I've been working with her

566
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Mention your name.

567
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,000
She reacted strongly.

568
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,960
You know,

569
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,280
What is the reason?

570
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,840
what

571
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:52,920
You know,

572
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,400
What's wrong with Xiao Xiao?

573
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,320
She didn't want to

574
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,160
Do you hear my name?

575
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,400
Boss, you have exposed yourself.

576
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:58,920
Say it.

577
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,080
Are you...

578
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,920
And fall in love with Xiao.

579
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,920
Okay, Meng Guo.

580
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,960
How dare you lie to me?

581
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,280
I was wrong.

582
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,800
Then make up for it.

583
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,320
How about this?

584
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,400
You asked me to look for him.

585
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,160
About Xiao Xiao.

586
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,320
Just now,

587
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,000
Forget about it.

588
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,040
That's more like it.

589
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,760
Are you asking me

590
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,520
Fall in love with her.

591
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,240
actually

592
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,960
I don't know.

593
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,760
What do you like?

594
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,760
perhaps

595
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,240
I just feel sorry for her.

596
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,960
The same as me.

597
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
And become a man.

598
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,600
Alright

599
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,560
When did you

600
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
So as to be enlightened.

601
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,320
Boss

602
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,560
This is an acquisition plan.

603
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,200
The Lin family's plan

604
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,040
I need your signature.

605
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,520
Once the signal is released,

606
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
There will be a good show.

607
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,000
The Lin clan moved to Huo Feng Lei.

608
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,400
It's cost-effective.

609
00:36:59,680 --> 00:36:59,880
Correct!

610
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
The stray cats outside

611
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Have you bought the cat litter?

612
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,400
Make it clear with the property management.

613
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,600
It's my adopted cat.

614
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,000
Don't drive them away.

615
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,520
I've already arranged it.

616
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,280
It's rare for you

617
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Be gentle and thoughtful once.

618
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,800
I must cooperate actively.

619
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,560
What are you thinking?

620
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,080
I'm old.

621
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,080
For health,

622
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,200
So I want to be more virtuous.

623
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,680
Brother Meng.

624
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,200
Mr. Huo,

625
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,200
I saw it outside.

626
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,120
There are so many beautiful cat houses.

627
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
The kittens have a home.

628
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,800
Xiao Xiao, I'm glad you like it.

629
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,040
These cat houses

630
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,280
But Mr. Huo chose

631
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,480
I picked it up in one night.

632
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
You're so picky.

633
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,920
Really

634
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,480
Mr. Huo,

635
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,520
It's you who gave the kittens

636
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,360
A gift?

637
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,360
You're so kind.

638
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
I just picked it up.

639
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,560
You can have a look.

640
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
That cat is your favorite.

641
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,840
On its cat badge,

642
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,320
And engraved your name.

643
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,200
Boss

644
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,760
You'll be spreading dog food.

645
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Be careful, okay?

646
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,360
I'm a single dog.

647
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
I want to live two more days.

648
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,160
Rats, screw you

649
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:09,840
Go to work.

650
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,520
Xiaoxiao

651
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,000
We meet again.

652
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,000
Why are you carrying so many things?

653
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,720
Let me help you.

654
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,240
Pretty sister, it's you.

655
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,040
Thank you.

656
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,240
you're welcome

657
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,760
It's you.

658
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,400
These things

659
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
It's available in the park every day.

660
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,560
And the housekeeper sent them to you.

661
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,800
Why are you taking it yourself?

662
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,920
Mr. Huo,

663
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,600
he

664
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
Don't like strangers.

665
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Go home.

666
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,920
and

667
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,560
He's a picky eater.

668
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,720
His requirements for ingredients

669
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,720
Are different.

670
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,080
Others

671
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,040
I don't know.

672
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,240
therefore

673
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,520
Or me?

674
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,600
Pick them yourself.

675
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,640
It's better.

676
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,040
So you and Mr. Huo

677
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
Are you close?

678
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Should

679
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,360
That's good.

680
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,760
but

681
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,240
His temper

682
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
So weird.

683
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,680
sometimes

684
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,640
He will.

685
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,920
I'm very happy.

686
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,600
Sometimes suddenly,

687
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,200
Super angry.

688
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,320
but

689
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm giving in to him.

690
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
Because Brother Meng said

691
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,040
That Mr. Huo

692
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
She's not well.

693
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,800
mind

694
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
It's not good.

695
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,760
therefore

696
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,880
I want to help him.

697
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,720
And love him.

698
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
You're really a good girl.

699
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,360
No wonder Lang Feng likes you so much.

700
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,520
sister

701
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,360
You know Brother Long Feng?

702
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,000
That's right.

703
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
We are very good friends.

704
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,120
Really?

705
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Now?

706
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,320
You are also my good friend.

707
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,440
that

708
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,200
I can

709
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,360
To visit you often?

710
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,280
MingXiaoxiao

711
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,760
Buy a vegetable.

712
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,360
Why is it so long?

713
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,040
I thought

714
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,440
You were kidnapped.

715
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,480
Come here.

716
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,200
Mr. Huo,

717
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
I made a new friend.

718
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,600
You can make her

719
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,560
Are you coming to our home?

720
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,240
It's a bit messy at home.

721
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,280
not as good as

722
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,480
Let's go to the beach.

723
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,840
Are you going to the beach?

724
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,560
But your body

725
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,320
Let's go secretly.

726
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,600
I won't tell Meng Guo.

727
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,600
Mr. Huo and Xiao Xiao are really close.

728
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,360
She looks

729
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,720
But she's not like a nanny at all.

730
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,480
This is my private affair.

731
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,160
Miss Lin,

732
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,760
You can tell me what you want to say.

733
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,800
I received a letter

734
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,720
For the acquisition contract.

735
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,240
Simply put,

736
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,800
Thank you, President Huo, for

737
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,960
To help the Lin clan.

738
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,480
So I offered to help.

739
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,120
The evidence in it is on you.

740
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,480
To deal with Huo Feng Lei and his son,

741
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,680
I think I can help.

742
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,800
Thank you for your kindness.

743
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
But these things

744
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,600
Meng Guo can handle it himself.

745
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,960
Don't worry, Mr. Huo.

746
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,120
I brought this today.

747
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,600
Not to make you appreciate it.

748
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,960
Huo Feng Lei and his son offended me.

749
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,840
I'm

750
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,240
Has always held a grudge.

751
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,480
therefore

752
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
We share a common hatred.

753
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,480
Of course

754
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,120
I know.

755
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:36,960
The Huo family.

756
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,840
Are not good at anything.

757
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,600
but

758
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,320
I'd rather believe you.

759
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,480
I admire you more.

760
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,520
Don't mind.

761
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,760
Once and for all,

762
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,560
Be cold-shouldered

763
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,640
I really appreciate it.

764
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,480
Miss Lin's taste

765
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,440
But I hope you can focus your energy

766
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
Focus on the cooperation between the two families.

767
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,520
Also

768
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,160
Please don't be alone in the future.

769
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,440
To chat with Xiao Xiao outside.

770
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,000
Her idea is simple.

771
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,720
It's easy to

772
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,680
As good friends.

773
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,120
If one day,

774
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Was really kidnapped.

775
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,720
That would be bad.

776
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,640
Pretty sister.

777
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,080
I picked up a lot of beautiful shells.

778
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,800
Can I give it to you?

779
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,400
It's really beautiful.

780
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,960
Thank you, Xiao Xiao.

781
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,080
I know, Mr. Huo.

782
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,760
I'll put together a list of

783
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,400
Of the Lin Group.

784
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,760
Inside the top secret information sent.

785
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,720
Looking forward to cooperation.

786
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,240
5

787
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,200
4

788
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,680
3

789
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:38,880
2

790
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,400
1

791
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,320
The son of a bitch's Meng Yue

792
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,480
Come out.

793
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,520
Meng Guo.

794
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,600
Boss

795
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,040
Come out now.

796
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,600
As you expected,

797
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,480
They're really here.

798
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,640
Go and have a look.

799
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,800
You came back here?

800
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,960
Should be more than...

801
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,240
Lord Huo is a fool.

802
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,280
good

803
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,000
Second Young Master.

804
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,920
Why are you here?

805
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,960
Is there anything wrong with the company?

806
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,360
The son of a bitch's Meng Yue

807
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,040
Are you trying to fool me again?

808
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,800
You gave Huo Yunting

809
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,520
What's the wind?

810
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,560
Why is he suddenly

811
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,360
Fire our father and son.

812
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,800
Where did he get those?

813
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,720
A mess of evidence.

814
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,520
I think you're tired of living.

815
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,280
That's it.

816
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,480
Shut up.

817
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,440
Meng,

818
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,080
Second Uncle hasn't seen Yun Ting for a long time.

819
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,280
Thank you.

820
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,960
Let me know.

821
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:24,880
please

822
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,960
Huo Yunting, what are you?

823
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,920
The Crown Prince.

824
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,720
Be quiet.

825
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,400
I'm talking to the chairman.

826
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,320
Talk about work.

827
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,760
What's the big deal?

828
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,280
Thank you, Second Uncle.

829
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,200
To come here.

830
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,200
Yunting.

831
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
You two brothers

832
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,760
Breaking bones and tendons.

833
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
I used to fight a lot.

834
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,640
It's okay.

835
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
Why are you taking it suddenly?

836
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,760
The company is talking about it.

837
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,480
I'm a veteran of three dynasties.

838
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,960
She's old.

839
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,360
It's useless.

840
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,680
You can forget about me.

841
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,240
But the Crown Prince is your real brother.

842
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,960
You did such a great job.

843
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,240
I went underground.

844
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,560
But how can I be with the Huo family?

845
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,040
My ancestors, my forefathers.

846
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,040
Second Uncle.

847
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,480
It's not you.

848
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,480
For so many years,

849
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,320
How can you speak and act?

850
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,720
You are so fake.

851
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,440
Why would I do that?

852
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,840
Didn't Lord Huo tell you why?

853
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,680
Or maybe

854
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,320
You made it before.

855
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,440
Those disgusting things.

856
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,720
You really treat others

857
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,920
Can't you find any evidence?

858
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,600
Listen to my advice.

859
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,680
If you don't want to be sad,

860
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,480
You can retire early.

861
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,320
Find a place where there's no one.

862
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,440
Take care of yourself.

863
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,600
And raise a fart.

864
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,880
All my father's assets

865
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,960
Are frozen by you.

866
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,520
Enough

867
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,720
Huo Yunting

868
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,320
everything

869
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
To give yourself a way out.

870
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,880
If I

871
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,800
I won't leave it.

872
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,600
You will regret it.

873
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,800
I would never...

874
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,360
Meng Guo.

875
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,160
Second Uncle's gray account in the Caymans

876
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,160
And the assets of all the mistresses.

877
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,360
Have you found out everything?

878
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,240
yes

879
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,520
All the evidence

880
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,480
Has been recorded.

881
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,480
The bad guys will be punished eventually.

882
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,360

You're lucky.

895
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,880

00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,440
A lean camel.

Bigger than Ma.

903
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,320
No matter what,

904
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,440
I'm also your second uncle.

905
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,200
Our uncle and nephew

906
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,840
Just give it a try.
