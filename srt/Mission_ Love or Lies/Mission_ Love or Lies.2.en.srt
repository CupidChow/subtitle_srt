VibeBerry Studio

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,680
Be patient. We'll be able to go home soon.  Be patient.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,320
Don't you know, junior, that this area is a blind spot?

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,160
Miss Patty could be in danger.

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,320
I'll come help you in a moment.

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,440
A fashionista like Miss Patty should know how to wear this.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
I came to teach you massage, so you can massage me.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm really enjoying this.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,640
Go, go, go

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,920
Ploy, Peerachada Khunrak as Achi

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,000
Punch, Naphassanan Kalaphan as Patty

12
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,880
Tian, Atcharee Buakhiao as Alice

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,840
Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
Here, massage.

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,120
Do it the way I taught you.

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,520
Use more pressure.

17
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Like that.

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,040
Now you're finally being a bit useful.

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
Since you've been here, this is the first day I've seen you be useful.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,200
Harder.

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh, I see.

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,360
After the recent assault incident,

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
Birom's face looks much brighter today,

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,280
and he says he's ready to answer all questions.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't worry too much, Miss Patty.

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,560
Soon you'll be able to go back and see your father.

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Thank you.

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Seeing news like this,

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Miss Patty must be stressed, right?

30
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,520
Yeah.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,440
But it's okay.

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,960
I understand the various situations well.

33
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,280
If any day you're suffering and can't bear it, want to vent,

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,240
Miss Patty can talk to Chama anytime.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Because Chama listens with the left ear and it goes right through the right ear immediately.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,640
I forget in a second, I won't hold it against you.

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,840
(Laughs)

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,960
You're so cute.

39
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,240
I guess only Miss Patty would say something like that.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Really?

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, the person who wants to be praised never praises me at all.

42
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,920
Who? Achi?

43
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,040
Chama always tries to be good to Achi,

45
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,480
but Achi never pays attention to Chama at all.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
It hurts to talk about it.

47
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,080
Where are you going?

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Shh...

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What happened?

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,720
I saw something. I'm going to check it out.

51
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,560
Should Chama come with you?

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
No need.

53
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Chama, stay in this room. I'll be back.

54
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
Won't be long.

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,960
Achi.

56
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Yes, it's me.

57
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,800
Hey, why are you grabbing me?

58
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,360
Go after that woman first, quick. I don't know where she went!

59
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Why are you holding me?

60
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,280
Let go!

61
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
Why are you grabbing me?

62
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,600
I told you to be quiet.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Hey! Which way did she go? Huh!

64
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Let go!

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
Hey, I said let go.

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,680
If you don't let go, I'm going myself.

67
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,800
You... why are you kissing me?

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Because you wouldn't stop talking.

69
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,720
The person you should be catching is that one, not me.

70
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,120
Still... still haven't learned your lesson.

71
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
What are you doing here anyway?

72
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Ow.

73
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
- Ow
- Miss Patty

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
What's wrong?

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
I feel dizzy.

76
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,240
I think I got too much dew on me.

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
Are you okay?

78
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,760
Then sit down and rest for a bit.

79
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,640
I'll be right back.

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,040
Miss Patty, stay right here, don't go anywhere.

81
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
Crazy.

82
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
Kissing like that.

83
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,320
What the...

84
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Someone saw me.

85
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Huh! What did you do to get caught?

86
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
I don't know.

87
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,520
Get in the car first. We'll talk in the car.

88
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,360
Ow.

89
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,520
How did you let them see you, Pop?

90
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,520
I don't know. I didn't know there'd be someone there.

91
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,040
You're so unprofessional.

92
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I think you're going to get us killed, Pide.

93
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't think we'll die.

94
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,120
But if they trace it back to you, we'll die together for sure, Pop.

95
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
What should we do?

96
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
First, we need to go back and tell the boss.

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Hmm.

99
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,760
What kind of crazy person kisses like that?

100
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,600
Sigh~

101
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,840
Go, let's go back to the room.

102
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
Oh!

103
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Where did she go?

104
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
I told her to wait here. So stubborn.

105
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Are you okay?

106
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Not really.

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey, can't we move in together?

108
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,600
I've said it many times already, but they won't agree.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,400
I don't know what to do either.

110
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,440
I feel really bad.

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,080
It's inconvenient to do anything. Like I'm being watched all the time.

112
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Really.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,760
Yeah.

114
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
She likes to spy on us, always watching.

115
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
Don't know what to care about.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Is Miss Patty badly hurt anywhere?

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm fine now.

118
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
Miss Patty!

119
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Here you are. I've been looking everywhere.

120
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,160
Alice, where have you been?

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
Do you know Miss Patty was outside alone just now?

122
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,080
How could you let her out of your sight?

123
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,400
It wasn't Alice.

124
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,680
It was you who left me and let me be alone.

125
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Lucky that Alice found me and brought me here.

126
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,360
I see.

127
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
Then... I apologize.

128
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Let's go, Miss Patty. I'll take you.

129
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,720
No need. I'll have Alice take me.

130
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,840
Oh!

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,920
Achi!!!

132
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
What are you doing?

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
Here she comes again, that annoying girl.

134
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,440
Sigh~

135
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,000
I saw they have a fitness center here, so I was going to invite everyone to work out,

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,240
and have Alice teach some self-defense techniques.

137
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,840
That junior?

138
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,638
Sponsored by Pro Fresh Milk

139
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,638
Convenient, finally some relief.

140
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:35,018
- I have to win an Oscar this year
- Sure

141
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:42,588
Sigh, so comfortable.

142
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:47,238
Isn't every room the same? Same bed.

143
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:52,798
Not the same, because this is Achi's bed and pillow.

144
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,078
Both fragrant and softer too.

145
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:01,528
This pillow has Achi's scent.

146
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,958
Then can I take it to cuddle in my room?

147
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:07,328
Then what will I sleep with? Think before you speak, Chama.

148
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:14,308
And you're lying here playing around. Aren't you going back to take care of Miss Patty?

149
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,578
No. Maybe later.

150
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:22,638
This is called neglecting your duties.

151
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:27,448
Aw, it's rare that I get to be alone with Achi.

152
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,378
Can't I have just a bit more time?

153
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:30,948
But...

154
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,268
Alice is here too, why are you overthinking?

155
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:42,538
Hey Achi.

156
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:44,528
I think we should sit and talk.

157
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,578
Hey, what's this?

158
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:48,958
Come on.

159
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:54,208
Ever since I met you, I haven't had a proper serious talk with Achi even once.

160
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:12,228
Why does this room look so spacious and airy? It feels comfortable being here.

161
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:14,788
Really?

162
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:16,538
Yes.

163
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:19,948
Plus the room design is even better.

164
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:24,458
That's why staying in this room feels comfortable,

165
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,748
not stuffy like that room.

166
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,138
Wait.

167
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,498
But aren't all the rooms the same?

168
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:35,238
Or maybe the stuffiness isn't about the room,

169
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,328
but something else.

170
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,028
Yeah, makes sense we've been together so long.

171
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:43,218
What kind of person? The more we're together, the more annoying.

172
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,768
Why does heaven like to tease me so much?

173
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,058
Really.

174
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,638
Why won't heaven let me be alone with Achi?

175
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,238
We work together all the time though.

176
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:57,728
It's duty.

177
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:00,918
I'm a bodyguard, I have to be with the bodyguard.

178
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,388
Hey~

179
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:06,128
What kind of bodyguard has no manners, speaks badly?

180
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,498
Doesn't respect coworkers at all.

181
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:12,128
Even though I'm junior, doesn't mean you have to suppress me like that.

182
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,638
It's too bad.

183
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:17,198
Come on, be patient a little longer.

184
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,328
Soon we'll be able to go home.

185
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:22,098
How much longer do I have to endure?

186
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,438
Oh, come here.

187
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:25,828
Just a little more.

188
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,408
I can't stand it much longer.

189
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,528
Please, be patient.

190
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,188
When will this mission end soon?

191
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,908
I prefer visiting you at home.

192
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,058
Bored?

193
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:45,268
Yes.

194
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,898
If Achi wasn't here, I wouldn't come.

195
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,178
If you could work with someone you like, you'd be very happy, right?

196
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:54,488
Yeah.

197
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,828
Very, very much.

198
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,828
Chama.

199
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,278
You see that I work very hard, right?

200
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:08,338
And I'm very serious about work. Barely have time to go anywhere.

201
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,508
You could say I'm crazy about it.

202
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:15,508
Then if you want to work with someone you like and have plenty of time,

203
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,048
why don't you try hitting on Alice?

204
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,818
I think she doesn't care much about work. She probably has lots of time to do other things.

205
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:31,398
Someone like that, if she had someone she liked, she'd probably be crazy in love, interesting to watch.

206
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:32,618
You should try.

207
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,368
Why are you saying this, Achi?

208
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,508
You're looking down on my love.

209
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,288
I'm not okay with this.

210
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:47,708
What do you see me as?

211
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,898
I'm not a thing, not a vegetable, not a fish,

212
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,508
that you can just pass on or give away to anyone easily.

213
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,118
Chama.

214
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,408
You forgot your shoes.

215
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,348
What the hell? Weird person.

216
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:49,328
P'Natee, are you sure

217
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:52,378
that no one knows we're here?

218
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:56,308
Of course. Why? What happened?

219
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,548
Well, yesterday at 8 PM,

220
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,108
I went out to patrol around the rooms.

221
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:05,648
I saw someone sneaking around suspiciously.

222
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,458
Really? A resort employee?

223
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:11,878
Probably not.

224
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,118
Because if it was really a resort employee,

225
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,928
when I walked toward them, they wouldn't have run away from me.

226
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:19,448
That's what I'm thinking.

227
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:22,838
So now, what should we do next?

228
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:24,958
Should we move immediately?

229
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,108
Wait a minute, don't.

230
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,328
Let me investigate the facts first to be sure, then I'll tell you.

231
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:35,658
What the hell? Still being complacent?

232
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,328
Not okay at all.

233
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:43,998
What if something dangerous happens to Miss Patty?

234
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,788
Come on, follow my orders.

235
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:48,308
Don't do anything yet, understand?

236
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:50,798
Acknowledged.

237
00:17:51,128 --> 00:17:52,398
But don't be slow.

238
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:55,238
Because if it's really a criminal, I won't let them get away.

239
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:09,948
Want to go to the fitness center?

240
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:12,918
Where are you guys going?

241
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:19,758
Oh, there you are. Thought you disappeared.

242
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,328
Why didn't you tell me you were going somewhere, junior?

243
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,458
You know, if something happens to Miss Patty,

244
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,068
can a bodyguard like you handle the responsibility?

245
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,218
We weren't going far.

246
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:40,218
I saw they have a fitness center here,

247
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:44,898
so we were going to work out together, and have Alice teach some self-defense techniques.

248
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,538
Huh! Have who teach?

249
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,668
That junior?

250
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,458
Yes, and what will you do about it?

251
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:57,988
You can barely take care of yourself, how can you teach anyone?

252
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,428
Why can't Alice teach me?

253
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:03,998
I know Alice well, and we've been together a long time.

254
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:09,638
Don't forget... yesterday Alice was the one who helped me.

255
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,408
Achi, don't you remember?

256
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,898
Better not. I don't trust her.

257
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:21,418
I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

258
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:24,588
As for that junior, go teach Chama over there.

259
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:27,958
Where's Chama?

260
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,518
I'll go get her.

261
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,608
Wait here, don't go anywhere.

262
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:36,838
What now?

263
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,398
It's okay. Stay calm. I'll handle it.

264
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:44,458
Okay.

265
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:48,898
Chama! Chama!

266
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:55,978
What is it, Achi?

267
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,468
Go change. We're going to the gym.

268
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,638
Why? I'm not going.

269
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,388
Come on.

270
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,478
Let's go to the gym. We'll be late.

271
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:19,168
Why the rush? The gym isn't going anywhere.

272
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,998
Hurry. Alice is going with Miss Patty first.

273
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,078
So what?

274
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:26,378
What's wrong with Alice going with Miss Patty first?

275
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:29,048
Nothing.

276
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:32,858
I just want to finish teaching the self-defense techniques,

277
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:35,028
so I'll have time to do other things.

278
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:37,988
Come on, Chama.

279
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,278
Go change. Quick, go.

280
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,088
Go change. We're going to the gym.

281
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,548
I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

282
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,118
And you, junior,

283
00:20:58,668 --> 00:20:59,798
you go teach Chama.

284
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:03,648
Why won't Achi teach me?

285
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,878
It's all the same whoever teaches, Chama. Go.

286
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:10,838
Let the junior teach. She can teach too.

287
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:13,168
Ah, you're taking Chama.

288
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,978
And Miss Patty, I'll teach Miss Patty myself.

289
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:21,108
Okay.

290
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:24,028
Go teach far away. It's distracting.

291
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:25,478
This way.

292
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,858
We'll use this machine.

293
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,818
Engage your core a bit.

294
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,458
First position is...

295
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,268
Next we'll learn shooting.

296
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,798
Person or buffalo?

297
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:47,498
Working hard there.

298
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:09,346
Sponsored by Loft Bangkok Hotel

299
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,246
CANALIS Airport Hotel

300
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,136
Hold here, Miss Patty.

301
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:20,616
Here.

302
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:22,896
Hold tight.

303
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,516
- Yes
- And sit up straight.

304
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,346
And engage your core a bit.

305
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:30,486
Correct.

306
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,516
Adjust the weight a bit.

307
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,426
One more time.

308
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,946
Now let's try lifting this one.

309
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:51,196
Mm.

310
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:05,876
I think it might be locked.

311
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,566
Hold here, Miss Patty.

312
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:15,256
And lift yourself up.

313
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:20,526
Here.

314
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:24,956
Lift, lift. 1, 2.

315
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,766
Yeah, this one.

316
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:32,456
Wow, you're quite strong.

317
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:34,156
Ow.

318
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,696
This machine hurts the abs too.

319
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,106
The treadmill should be easiest for us.

320
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:43,326
Then should we try that side?

321
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:44,736
Okay.

322
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:50,216
Pretty good.

323
00:23:58,486 --> 00:23:59,716
Let's try this one too.

324
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:07,436
This one isn't locked.

325
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:10,086
Try, try this one.

326
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:13,886
Then I'll go try it.

327
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,766
That one's locked.

328
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:20,826
Like this?

329
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:24,716
Oh, it... should definitely be unlocked now.

330
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:30,476
Then... let's start.

331
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:34,026
How is it? Okay?

332
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,596
Okay.

333
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:49,256
First position is...

334
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:51,566
Like this.

335
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:02,736
Eh, I don't think that's right, Alice

336
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:04,566
Really?

337
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,756
Uh, like this?

338
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,606
Oh yes. Yes, that should be right.

339
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:14,256
Okay.

340
00:25:23,716 --> 00:25:26,876
But to be safe, better hold on.

341
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:29,646
Yes.

342
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,646
Alice.

343
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:42,256
I think we should get something to drink instead.

344
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,416
Seeing them is really irritating.

345
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:49,206
Yeah.

346
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:06,706
The order.

347
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:09,706
One matcha latte, one Thai tea less sweet,

348
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:12,686
and one latte, and one fresh milk.

349
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:15,576
All with Pro Fresh milk please.

350
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,346
Okay.

351
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:27,266
We use Pro Fresh milk, ready-to-drink fresh milk, for every perfectly balanced menu item.

352
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:31,116
This milk will enhance the flavor making the drinks even more delicious.

353
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:34,256
Fragrant, rich, easy to foam, smooth fine foam,

354
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:35,706
and stable for a long time.

355
00:26:54,006 --> 00:26:55,776
I told them to practice. Where did they go?

356
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:58,836
Chama and I went to get drinks for them.

357
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:00,986
Doing good gets no recognition.

358
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:03,986
When you're not the favorite, everything you do is wrong, right?

359
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:09,596
Here, Miss Patty's Thai tea less sweet.

360
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:11,376
Thank you.

361
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,446
Here, Pro Fresh milk for senior.

362
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,476
I'll take this coffee instead.

363
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:20,376
Eh!

364
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,436
And the milk, you drink it.

365
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:24,606
Drink lots so you'll grow fast.

366
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:27,056
How can that be? That cup is mine.

367
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,866
Chama, didn't you say senior likes milk?

368
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:37,866
Mm, refreshing.

369
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:44,526
Hmm.

370
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,676
It's delicious too.

371
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,316
Drink lots.

372
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:51,916
Go shower now.

373
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:53,956
Are you going to sleep like that?

374
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:55,486
Alice.

Next we'll learn shooting.

380
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,274
Uh... wait a moment.

381
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,854
I need to use the restroom.

382
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:43,924
Sure, go ahead.

383
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,684
Alice will take me to the restroom.

384
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:48,164
Right, Alice?

385
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,584
Go. Let's go to the restroom first.

386
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:58,444
Sigh, so tired.

387
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,214
Are you going to the restroom too?

388
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,284
No, I don't need to at all.

389
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:06,374
I'd rather stay with Achi.

390
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,504
Achi-Chama, Chama-Achi.

391
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,534
Ow!

392
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:20,634
I'm so tired and I still have to practice shooting.

393
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:25,374
Person or buffalo? So diligent.

394
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:29,774
And next is shooting practice.

395
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,374
What am I going to do?

396
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:35,524
I know.

397
00:29:36,104 --> 00:29:39,734
We don't have to focus on accuracy, we'll focus on looking good.

398
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:42,384
Alright.

399
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:44,204
Go.

400
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:49,024
Kahr MK9 pistol.

401
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,484
9mm Micro Compact.

402
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:54,504
We chose this one because it's the smallest,

403
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,584
convenient to carry, and just the right weight.

404
00:29:57,954 --> 00:29:59,874
Four gun safety rules:

405
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:02,364
1. Check the weapon every time.

406
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:04,494
2. Watch where the barrel points.

407
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,874
3. Keep finger off the trigger.

408
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:10,614
And 4. Be certain every time you shoot.

409
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,484
Wait.

410
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:17,084
Everything I just said, this gun,

411
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:19,264
is not it.

412
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:20,434
Oh!

413
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:24,064
For safety, today we'll use this gun.

414
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,314
Oh.

415
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:36,174
Here, aim at the target and squeeze.

416
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:42,654
Wow, so good, Achi! Hit the target perfectly.

417
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:45,814
Holding the gun looks so cool too. Amazing.

418
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:47,914
I'll shoot one more time for you to see.

419
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:53,224
Hit again.

420
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:54,534
Achi is so good.

421
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,024
Your turn, junior.

422
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:03,934
I think we shouldn't waste time.

423
00:31:03,934 --> 00:31:06,164
Should we shoot together?

424
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:11,624
Come on, Miss Patty. I'll teach you.

425
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:13,484
Oh, okay.

426
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:18,334
Go ahead.

427
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:22,534
Very good, Miss Patty.

428
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,414
Hit the target perfectly.

429
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,174
- Want to try?
- Try.

430
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:33,054
Try it. We're bodyguards.

431
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:37,414
Wow, beautiful form.

432
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:39,944
But the target is over here.

433
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:44,284
Oh, it's okay. We'll practice gradually.

434
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:45,844
Try again.

435
00:31:45,844 --> 00:31:47,794
Let me try, let me try.

436
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,484
Achi, help teach me.

437
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:50,364
Ow!

438
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:53,624
Chama.

439
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,324
Try again. It's okay.

440
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:05,434
I'm sorry, boss.

441
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,484
I told you, didn't I, to be careful?

442
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:12,744
Boss,

443
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,944
but I was being careful the whole time.

444
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:16,964
Careful my ass.

445
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,594
Almost got caught, and you're still arguing with me?

446
00:32:21,114 --> 00:32:24,954
I always told you to watch from far away, don't let them catch you.

447
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:29,934
Your only job is to report to me. Absolutely forbidden to show your face to them.

448
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:33,264
But you messed up, so now what do you want me to do?

449
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:36,634
Boss, boss.

450
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:40,214
I promise, next time it won't happen again.

451
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:47,414
If next time you disobey orders again, you won't make it to the police,

452
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:51,124
because I'll send you to the underworld instead.

453
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:54,644
Yes, boss.

454
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:09,584
Go shower now.

455
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:11,644
Are you going to sleep like that?

456
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:13,654
Alice.

457
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:23,934
Not dead yet. Still breathing.

458
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,664
Why sleeping so deeply?

459
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:48,714
Hey!

460
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:51,244
What the hell?

461
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:56,114
Such a burden. Help out, will you?

462
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:07,444
- PIDE
- Huh!

463
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:09,884
I think I want to quit.

464
00:34:11,034 --> 00:34:11,884
Hey!

465
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,714
Why?

466
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,224
I've been trying my best,

467
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:21,284
but the boss keeps scolding me, always scolding me.

468
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,124
Pop,

469
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:30,284
if you mess up work, you just go to jail.

470
00:34:31,454 --> 00:34:32,354
You won't die.

471
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:35,744
You know what the boss is like.

472
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:41,544
If you go against the boss, he'll kill you.

473
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:48,964
Can't get off the tiger's back once you're on.

474
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:56,684
Go, let's go back to the boss.

475
00:34:58,694 --> 00:34:59,474
Let's go.

476
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:13,604
Achi.

477
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,624
What is it, Chama?

478
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:20,554
Why did you wake up so early?

479
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:25,874
Well... I wanted to open my eyes and see your face first thing.

480
00:35:27,484 --> 00:35:28,544
Really?

481
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:35,404
Did you go running alone? Where's the other bodyguard?

482
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,254
Should be awake. Probably showering.

483
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:42,524
Then if you don't have anything else, I'm going.

484
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,504
Wait, wait, wait!

485
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:47,024
What now?

486
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:49,864
Um... well...

487
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:52,324
Miss Patty wants to eat in her room today.

488
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,214
Why?

489
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:57,554
Probably tired from yesterday.

490
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:00,544
Then bring her congee too.

491
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:03,334
Sure, I'll arrange it.

492
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:04,904
But...

493
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:08,684
I'm free to eat at the dining room with you.

494
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,344
Don't you need to stay and look after Miss Patty?

495
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:13,664
Well, she's in her room.

496
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,624
But we're working, Chama.

497
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:20,724
I think you should eat in the room with Miss Patty. It's safer.

498
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:27,184
But... I want to eat with you, just the two of us.

499
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:30,694
But I come to see you often anyway.

500
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,694
You never come to see me at all.

501
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:37,434
Know-it-all.

502
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,564
Then I'm going.

503
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:50,454
Hey!

504
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,554
It's late. Still not awake?

505
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,744
Junior, are you going to sleep all day?

506
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,074
I said you can wake up now.

507
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,894
Not waking up? Fine.

508
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,084
Hey, get up!

509
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,554
It's late.

510
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,074
Why is your hand hot?

511
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:19,394
Hey!

512
00:37:23,314 --> 00:37:24,674
Your body is burning up.

513
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:26,094
Alice.

514
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:38,324
Here.

515
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:41,184
Thank you.

516
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:44,414
Where are Achi and Alice?

517
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:45,674
Haven't they come yet?

518
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:47,154
Oh, they're in the room.

519
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:48,664
Oh!

520
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:51,044
Usually they should be taking care of us, right?

521
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:53,234
And it's already time.

522
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:55,184
Why so late?

523
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,194
Should be late.

524
00:37:57,194 --> 00:38:01,124
And it's probably just Achi coming to look after us today.

525
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:05,374
Why? Where's Alice?

526
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,934
Alice is really sick. Very feverish.

527
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:14,794
Achi just called to tell Chama, to have Chama look after Miss Patty first.

528
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:18,914
Where are you going?

529
00:38:19,204 --> 00:38:20,834
I think I'll go see Alice.

530
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,504
Shouldn't you eat first?

531
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,484
No, I want to go now.

532
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,474
Achi, wake up.

533
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,664
What happened to my clothes?

534
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,354
Well...

535
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:13,484
Try to think carefully.

536
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:19,074
During this time, who have you been with that makes you feel special or happier than before?

537
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:24,814
Hey Achi! Why did you grab my hand and...

538
00:40:24,814 --> 00:40:26,684
touch your breast?

539
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:29,054
Are you crazy? I wasn't thinking anything like that.
