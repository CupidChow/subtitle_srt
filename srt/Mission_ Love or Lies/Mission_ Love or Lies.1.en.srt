VibeBerry Studio

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
Would you like a massage, darling?

3
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Do you like it?

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,560
I knew about you all along.

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,360
Who sent you here?

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,360
You won't escape anyway,

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,840
because I've planted time bombs all around this house.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,760
Well, before we die,

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,640
let's have some fun together.

10
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
Dream!

11
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
Hey, it's already 7:30.

12
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,080
Dreaming again?

13
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,920
When will it become real?

14
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,640
Oh no, it's already 7:30!

15
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,800
Better get to work.

16
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Let's go, let's go to work.

17
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,560
Give me a kiss to brighten my day like in the dream.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,160
Let's go to work. Hurry up!

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,920
Ploy, Peerachada Khunrak as Achi

20
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Punch, Naphassanan Kalaphan as Patty

21
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,840
Tian, Atcharee Buakhiao as Alice

22
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,840
Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

23
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Hello.

24
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,080
Are you Achi?

25
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
We're ready. Shall we go now?

26
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Hey, you.

27
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,480
You.

28
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
Hey, you.

29
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm sorry, I didn't get much sleep.

30
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm ready. I've prepared the room for you.

31
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,640
Please come in.

32
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,120
After the recent assassination attempt,

33
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,840
this morning, Miss Praepanrai Siwatchaponlaglai, Patty,

34
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,040
the daughter of Sire Phirom, along with her close bodyguard,

35
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
has returned to Thailand.

36
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Plain-clothes police have escorted her to a safe location.

37
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,800
Police Lieutenant Colonel Natee Veerachakul,

38
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,120
or Inspector Tee,

39
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,360
revealed to reporters that he wants everyone to feel at ease.

40
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
"Everyone can rest assured because the police department

41
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
is taking very good care of and protecting Patty.

42
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Right now, she's staying at a place

43
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,200
provided by the police department, under complete protection and security."

44
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
You two don't need to worry.

45
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,000
Especially you, Patty. I will protect you to the best of my ability.

46
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
How long do we have to stay here?

47
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,280
Until the situation improves

48
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,080
and the police can arrest the criminals who attacked your father.

49
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,200
Patty, don't worry.

50
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,680
You will be safe and return home to your father.

51
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
Keep it down a little.

52
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
Show some consideration. This is Miss Patty.

53
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,520
You two should rest. I'll go check the security outside.

54
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,320
Hello, P'Tee.

55
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
How is it?

56
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Everything's fine. Just arrived at the hotel.

57
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,840
What about  Patty? Is she being difficult?

58
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,880
Not at all.

59
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,560
Everything's fine. She's not as troublesome as you said.

60
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
Really? That's strange.

61
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,960
But she's beautiful, right?

62
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Very beautiful.

63
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,920
The atmosphere here is getting better. Otherwise, it would be so boring.

64
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,640
Hey, don't talk like that. I've already made plans, don't worry.

65
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll send someone to stay with you so you won't be lonely.

66
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,920
Who?

67
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't tell me...

68
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes, Chama. Come on.

69
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,080
Can we change people?

70
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,600
If she comes, it'll be chaos.

71
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,720
Come on, I don't think anyone else is more suitable than her.

72
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Suitable for what?

73
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,240
If she comes, will probably...

74
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Hey, another call. That's all for now, Achi. I'll call tomorrow.

75
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,920
P'Tee! P'Tee!

76
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,480
Achi!

77
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,040
Here already, you troublemaker.

78
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,760
I missed you so much! We haven't seen each other in so long.

79
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,120
How did you get here, Chama? How did you know I was here?

80
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,960
I followed my heart.

81
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,040
Wherever there's Achi, there's Chama.

82
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,640
Achi-Chama, Chama-Achi.

83
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Let me remind you that this place isn't as comfortable as home.

84
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,040
You can still go back now. I give you permission.

85
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Oh, come on! I made the effort to come find you.

86
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Two heads are better than one, right?

87
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
Well, okay, fine.

88
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
If you want to stay, stay.

89
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
But let me say this first: don't cause any trouble here.

90
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,440
Otherwise, I'll send you straight back home, no matter what.

91
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Okay, understood.

92
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,440
Chama will be Achi's best assistant, I promise.

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,280
This is Chama.

94
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
Hello.

95
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Hello.

96
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Chama will help take care of this mission.

97
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,880
If there's anything I can help with, just let me know. I'll do my best, don't hold back.

98
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440
Don't overdo it, Chama.

99
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,800
There's nothing more for today.

100
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
Patty must be tired from traveling. Let's all go rest.

101
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Wait a minute.

102
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
Are you telling all of us to sleep cramped together in this tiny room?

103
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't think so.

104
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,680
No.

105
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,520
There's another room prepared here. We'll split up 2-2.

106
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,160
Then I'll sleep with Patty.

107
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,480
Then I'll sleep with Achi.

108
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
No.

109
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
There's a room specifically prepared for bodyguards.

110
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,600
You must sleep with me, Alice.

111
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
And you, Chama,

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,960
you must stay and watch over Miss Patty in this room.

113
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,920
Oh!

114
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,748
Sponsored by Nom Pro Fresh

115
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,988
This bodyguard room is pretty big too.

116
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,508
I thought it would be as small as a mouse hole.

117
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,708
We're here to work, not as victims.

118
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,708
We should sleep comfortably.

119
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,708
Well, Patty's room is right next door.

120
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:35,148
Great, I can visit easily.

121
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:37,748
I think I'll go take a shower.

122
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:39,508
What business do you have going in there?

123
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:40,748
Nothing.

124
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:42,148
Are you sure?

125
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,428
Mm-hmm.

126
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,148
Hey, Chama.

127
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:01,708
Tonight, you sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the sofa.

128
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,308
Oh no, I'll sleep on the sofa.

129
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:18,868
Ouch!

130
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:26,268
Ouch!

131
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:34,428
No need, I'll get it myself.

132
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,508
I don't know if my head is cracked.

133
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:44,908
Ouch! Does it hurt?

134
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,188
Let me blow on it for you.

135
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,428
Hey, your head is just as red.

136
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,588
What kind of person has such a hard head?

137
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:42,308
You, hey you.

138
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:43,868
What?

139
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:47,028
Can you get me the pajamas from my bag?

140
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:48,988
Ew!

141
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,628
What? Can't you help a little? No consideration at all.

142
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:56,308
Come on, why don't you wrap a towel and come get it yourself?

143
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:58,108
I'm not your servant.

144
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,628
I don't know how to wrap a towel.

145
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,948
What kind of crazy person doesn't know how to wrap a towel?

146
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,868
Someone like me.

147
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,388
Hurry up.

148
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,748
If you don't get it for me, I'll just strip and go get it myself.

149
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,268
Wait, wait, wait!

150
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,788
Please, calm down.

151
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,548
I'll get it for you.

152
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,068
Hurry up.

153
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:26,748
Just a second.

154
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,868
Here, take it.

155
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:39,308
Take it.

156
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:40,988
And get dressed properly.

157
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:43,548
Why?

158
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,308
We're both bodyguards, what's there to be embarrassed about?

159
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:49,548
I don't like seeing other people's stuff.

160
00:15:54,668 --> 00:15:55,268
Ugh!

161
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,268
So annoying. No privacy at all.

162
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,508
Hello, Phirom.

163
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,028
Inspector Tee, please sit.

164
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,788
Have you eaten anything?

165
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:14,548
Not yet, sir. But it's okay.

166
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:18,828
I wanted to come update you about Patty first. I was worried you'd be concerned.

167
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,668
Is everything alright?

168
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,548
Right now, everything is going according to plan.

169
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:26,108
Patty is in a safe location.

170
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:29,228
She's well protected by uniformed police. You can rest assured.

171
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,868
Has she caused any problems for the team?

172
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:33,428
None at all.

173
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:37,868
According to my subordinates' reports, Patty is quite obedient and sweet.

174
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:39,588
She's not at all like what you described.

175
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:40,828
That's good.

176
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,588
What about the criminals? Any progress?

177
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,468
We're currently tracking the leads.

178
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,308
I have enough evidence to trace back to the source.

179
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,308
I guarantee we'll close this case for certain, sir.

180
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:59,708
If it's as you say, that would be good.

181
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:05,468
As for me, I don't know if I'll die today or tomorrow.

182
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:08,548
I'm only worried about my daughter.

183
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:11,668
Patty only has me.

184
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,228
I just want her to live happily in Thailand, that's all.

185
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,868
I understand, sir. I give you my word

186
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:25,428
that I will bring the criminals to justice in this case, absolutely.

187
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,388
Drinking water.

188
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,428
Thank you.

189
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,308
Have some water first.

190
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,828
Stay and have dinner with me before you go.

191
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:40,268
Thank you, sir.

192
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,268
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

193
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:48,308
You're welcome.

194
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:00,868
Sigh...

195
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:03,708
The atmosphere here is quite nice.

196
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,228
Better close things with P'Tee.

197
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,628
Otherwise, they'll say we're unprofessional.

198
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:24,308
P'Tee, what are you doing?

199
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,548
Asleep yet?

200
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,828
Probably already sleeping.

201
00:18:31,348 --> 00:18:35,988
I'm so jealous. Getting to sleep comfortably at home. Sigh!

202
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,788
Not yet, but almost.

203
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:46,748
Yeah. Everyone's about to sleep here.

204
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,228
Really? Why aren't you sleeping yet, Achi?

205
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,868
Can't sleep. Probably because it's a different place.

206
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,788
I met with Phirom today.

207
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,908
How did it go?

208
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:04,028
Just reported about his daughter arriving safely at the accommodation as usual.

209
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,028
What do we need to do tomorrow?

210
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:10,348
Nothing yet. Just waiting for orders.

211
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:13,268
If there's anything urgent, I'll call and let you know.

212
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,268
Understood.

213
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,908
Sigh! One day down.

214
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,468
Hello, viewers.

215
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,108
We're now with Inspector Natee Veerachakul.

216
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,948
What's the current situation?

217
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:35,748
The current situation is this:

218
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:38,268
After Phirom was attacked

219
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,828
after serving as chairman of the anti-drug campaign,

220
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:43,948
the police department hasn't been sitting idle.

221
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:47,788
We're trying to find evidence and rushing to catch the criminals for punishment as quickly as possible.

222
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,828
I understand Minister Phirom is very worried about his daughter.

223
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:56,028
The police department has taken her to a safe location

224
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,548
and is providing 24-hour protection.

225
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,628
Don't worry.

226
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,948
Hey, are you going to be in the bathroom much longer?

227
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,548
You must be turning into a prune from all that bathing.

228
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:22,308
Wait a sec, almost done, almost done.

229
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,588
I'm counting to 5.

230
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:28,148
If you're not out, I'm not waiting anymore. Fair warning.

231
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:31,108
One.

232
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,268
Two.

233
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,228
- Three.
- Done, done!

234
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,308
So slow!

235
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:51,148
In this condition, they wouldn't call this "done."

236
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57,908
Seriously, how did you pass training?

237
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:02,148
You're so slow. How can you take care of anyone?

238
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:05,468
I really feel sorry for Miss Patty having to be with someone like you.

239
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,868
Look, I can manage.

240
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,308
Don't act like you're a burden.

241
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:16,708
I just finished training. I need to gain experience first, naturally.

242
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:19,828
Who's going to be perfect from birth? Try to understand a little.

243
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,508
So unlucky to have to work with someone like you.

244
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:25,668
Well...

245
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:28,108
I'll get better on my own.

246
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,188
Then you can teach me.

247
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:35,188
Why should I be the one to teach someone like you?

248
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:38,948
We're on the same team. We should help each other out.

249
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,188
Try to have some consideration in what you say.

250
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,108
I can help you.

251
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,108
But since you came after me and I came first,

252
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,828
you have to call me Senior.

253
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,828
Come on, try saying it.

254
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:55,308
Senior.

255
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:58,508
I can't hear you.

256
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:02,508
Senior, Senior, Senior!

257
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:04,068
Clear enough?

258
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:07,868
Very good.

259
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:12,828
But I'll call you Junior.

260
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:15,748
Call me whatever you want.

261
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:19,868
Just remember,

262
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:25,308
when I tell you to do something, you have to do what I say.

263
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,028
I forgot one more thing.

264
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:40,868
I'm very tough.

265
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:44,068
Prepare to take the impact,

266
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,148
Junior.

267
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:47,748
Yes.

268
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:51,748
Um, the thing is...

269
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,108
How do I wear this outfit?

Oops! Coffee.

273

Wait! Where are you going?

274
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,376
Can't I have coffee first, Senior?

275
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:54,896
We haven't done any work yet. How can you drink coffee?

276
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:57,816
Patty won't mind.

277
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:03,976
Look, Patty must be very nice to you to let you behave so badly.

278
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,616
With another boss, you'd have been fired from the first moment.

279
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,216
That's too much, Senior.

280
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,216
It's not too much.

281
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,456
Seriously, are you really a bodyguard?

282
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:15,696
Oh well...

283
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:17,176
It's just today.

284
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:20,576
Normally I work well every day. Patty always compliments me.

285
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:22,936
Wait.

286
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:26,376
I think I'll make spaghetti for Patty.

287
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,856
Um, Senior, do you know how to cook?

288
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,376
It doesn't look that hard.

289
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,736
Then make some for me too. I'll go sit and wait.

290
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:38,936
Sure, go ahead. You're in the way.

291
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:19,536
Done.

292
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,056
Oh, this.

293
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:23,056
Wow!

294
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,096
It looks really good.

295
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:28,896
And it's delicious too.

296
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,616
Then I'll try it.

297
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:43,936
It's so delicious!

Chef-level skills!

299
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:47,896
Of course.

300
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:04,976
How do I wear this shirt?

301
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:09,776
Where does this strap go?

302
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:13,816

Chama.

305
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,376
Can you come in for a moment?

306
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:29,856
Um, the thing is...

307
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,336
How do I wear this outfit?

308
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:34,256
Uh...

309
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:40,056
Patty, I think you're wearing it inside out.

310
00:26:41,176 --> 00:26:42,056
Inside out?

311
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:45,496
Let me help you.

312
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:46,776
Mm-hmm.

313
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:50,356
You need to turn this around to the back.

314
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,896
This strap goes around the neck.

315
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:38,896
All done.

316
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:42,816
Is it done?

317
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,016
Thank you.

318
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,896
By the way...

319
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:51,136
When you bought this, didn't you ask the shop how to wear it?

320
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:53,456
Oh.

321
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,736
I think I forgot.

322
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:00,976
Forgot?

323
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:06,616
But a fashionista like you should know how to wear it.

324
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:10,896
Never mind.

325
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:13,936
I'm hungry.

326
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:15,696
Let's go find something to eat.

327
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:17,176
Mm-hmm.

328
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:23,456
Are you up?

329
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:27,616
Yes, and already dressed.

330
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,296
Good.

331
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:30,656
Food is ready.

332
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,936
You can bring Patty to the dining room.

333
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:36,336
Okay, okay. We were just about to walk over.

334
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,416
See you in the dining room.

335
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:39,936
Mm-hmm.

336
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,416
Hey!

337
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:46,136
I forgot to message P'Tee. Better report in.

338
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,416
P'Tee, what are you doing?

339
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,856
Right now at the hotel, we're having a meal.

340
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:08,056
Wow, the vegetables here are so fresh.

341
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:09,896
They must grow them themselves for sure.

342
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:14,176
Ew!

343
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:16,576
But there are no tomatoes.

344
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:18,896
Senior, do you know?

345
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,816
In foreign countries, tomatoes are very sweet.

346
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,576
Abroad, they're considered fruit.

347
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:30,256
But I don't know why when they're in Thailand, the taste is sour and strange.

348
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,856
I don't like them at all. Ew.

349
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:40,736
Here, eat.

350
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:43,016
I don't want it. Ew!

351
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:47,376
You know, ever since I started eating solid food, I've hated tomatoes the most.

352
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:51,336
Are you going to disobey my order, Junior Bodyguard?

353
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,056
I don't want it.

354
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:56,176
You have to eat.

355
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,376
Don't disobey orders.

356
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:06,456
Just this much.

357
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:10,496
Chew it. Don't spit it out either.

358
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:18,176
Hey, this way, this way.

359
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,976
Then teach me how to give a massage, Senior.

360
00:30:21,856 --> 00:30:23,536
Go, go, go.

365
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,484
Achi!

366
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:08,484
Did you wait long?

367
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:15,324
I'm so hungry. My stomach's growling.

368
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:17,284
Let's see what there is to eat.

369
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:18,324
Let's go.

370
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:21,284
How are you? Can you manage?

371
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,404
I'm fine, don't worry.

372
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:26,044
Is it strange sleeping here?

373
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,244
Well... I couldn't sleep well.

374
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,164
I think the bed here is too hard.

375
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:31,964
Really?

376
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:35,524
Be patient. Soon you'll be able to go home.

377
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:38,684
If there's anything, tell me right away, understand?

378
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:41,044
Okay.

379
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,364
Don't worry. I'm very comfortable.

380
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:46,164
Mm-hmm.

381
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,364
What are you doing here?

382
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:57,764
Don't you know, Junior, that this is a blind spot?

383
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:00,604
Patty could be in danger.

384
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,644
It's okay, don't blame Alice.

385
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:07,724
I was the one who brought her here.

386
00:32:08,044 --> 00:32:11,524
I wanted to ask her something, but now it's settled.

387
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:13,484
I'm hungry.

388
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:17,164
Let's go eat. Come on.

389
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:28,404
Achi!

390
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:38,364
Patty, wait at this table. I'll go get food for you.

391
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,484
Okay.

392
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:42,644
Where are the others sitting?

393
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,884
I'll go sit at that table.

394
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:47,324
Why do we have to sit far apart?

395
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,004
Come sit and eat together.

396
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,324
- But...
- No buts.

397
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:53,804
It's better to sit and eat together.

398
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:56,404
Patty doesn't want to sit and eat alone.

399
00:32:56,884 --> 00:33:00,084
Hey, Alice, come sit next to Patty.

400
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,804
And Chama, sit next to Achi. Okay?

401
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:04,044
Yes, as you wish.

402
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,204
Then Patty, wait at the table.

403
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:10,644
It's okay. Patty can take care of herself.

404
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:14,724
Chama's hungry. Let's go get food.

405
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:18,044
Right, me too, Chama. Let's go.

406
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:28,684
Okay, okay, okay.

407
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,004
Hello, Pin.

408
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,764
Hello, Inspector.

409
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:34,604
Let me hang up first.

410
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:38,524
How are the kids doing?

411
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:40,004
They're fine, Pin.

412
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:42,764
What a relief.

413
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:46,524
If anything happens, please help take care of them.

414
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,804
I'll take good care of them, don't worry.

415
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:54,284
Inspector Tee!

416
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:57,004
How long have you been here? What are you doing here?

417
00:33:57,324 --> 00:34:00,964
I saw Pin standing here, so I came over to say hello.

418
00:34:00,964 --> 00:34:04,124
I was going to go inside to see you after finishing talking with Pin.

419
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:07,004
Have you finished talking?

420
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:09,484
Or should I wait inside the house?

421
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:14,884
We were just casually catching up a bit, nothing much.

422
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:18,484
Then let's go inside.

423
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:19,724
Alright.

424
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:22,004
Yes, let's go.

425
00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:25,564
It's hot outside. It's cool and comfortable inside.

426
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,284
I'll have someone serve water in a moment.

427
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,244
Thank you. Then I'll go in first.

428
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:30,764
Okay.

429
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:43,204
Here, here, here.

430
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:47,404
Can you manage?

431
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:48,644
Thank you.

432
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:52,364
So you won't be hungry, you know.

433
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,884
Try this one too.

434
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:01,884
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

435
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,364
It's all over your face. Come here.

436
00:35:15,164 --> 00:35:15,924
Aren't you hungry?

437
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:18,964
It's okay. Patty, you eat first.

438
00:35:20,804 --> 00:35:21,884
Achi, you can eat this.

439
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:25,604
You go ahead and eat, Chama.

440
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:26,964
There's plenty more.

441
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:45,804
Hello, viewers.

442
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:47,844
Meet Mick on today's noon news.

443
00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:50,764
Recently, Phirom Siwatchaponlakai,

444
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:54,004
or the famous politician we know well as "the cat with nine lives,"

445
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:57,484
has gone to give a statement to the police for the second time

446
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:59,964
following the recent assassination attempt.

447
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:02,884
Today, Phirom looks much brighter

448
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:04,884
and said he's ready to answer all questions

449
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:07,764
to make the police's work as smooth as possible.

450
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:17,804
Where are you going?

451
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,204
I'm bored.

452
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:24,044
So I thought I'd go see Patty.

453
00:36:24,524 --> 00:36:27,324
Why? Let her rest.

454
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:29,884
It's so boring.

455
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:32,164
Sitting here with nothing to do.

456
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:34,084
What are you doing, Senior?

457
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:37,804
I'm checking the news.

458
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,324
And how is it?

459
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:40,924
Nothing much.

460
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:43,684
Hey, are you free, Junior?

461
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,324
Come give me a massage.

462
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,364
My neck really hurts. I think I slept wrong last night.

463
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:51,444
Is this part of the mission?

464
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:52,644
Yes.

465
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,324
I told you already,

466
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:58,404
when Senior tells you to do something, Junior has to do it.

467
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:00,444
But I don't know how to massage.

468
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,164
It's not hard. Come here.

469
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,724
Come massage me. My neck hurts so much.

470
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:12,164
Okay.

471
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:15,084
Hey, use more force.

472
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:17,804
That's as hard as I can go.

473
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:20,244
What kind of bodyguard are you? Is that all the strength you have?

474
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,564
I don't know how to massage.

475
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:24,644
This way, this way.

476
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:27,404
Then teach me how, Senior.

477
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,244
Okay, let me show you.

478
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:37,204
Come on, Senior, I'm ready to learn.

479
00:37:38,364 --> 00:37:41,324
Look, when you massage, you have to do it like this.

480
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:43,444
Put some force into it.

481
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,924
What about the arms, Senior?

482
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:48,284
Come on, how hard can it be? Look.

483
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:51,564
How's that?

484
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:55,684
When you massage, you have to do it like this. Then I'll feel less tired.

485
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:57,764
Oh, what if...

486
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:02,084
Senior gets a headache? How do I massage that?

487
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:03,804
- Here, right?
- Yes, yes.

488
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,444
Look, just massage like this.

489
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:08,524
How's that?

490
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:11,484
Hey Senior, can you do my back a bit more?

491
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,924
Hey, that's not right.

492
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:17,804
I'm here to teach you how to massage, for you to massage me.

493
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:20,004
I was really enjoying it.

494
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,524
Go, go, go.

495
00:38:57,804 --> 00:38:58,684
Where are you going?

496
00:38:58,804 --> 00:38:59,444
Shh...

497
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,524
P'Natee, are you sure

498
00:39:02,044 --> 00:39:04,644
that no one knows we're staying here?

499
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:17,884
How much longer do I have to endure this?

500
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:19,884
I'm starting to not be able to take it anymore.

501
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:22,364
Please be patient.

502
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:24,724
Alice!
