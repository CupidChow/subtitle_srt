00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Hey Achi, what are you doing?

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,840
I just want you to notice that when you touch me,

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,840
do you still feel butterflies like when you first got close to me?

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
Think about it carefully.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,920
During this time, who have you been with that makes you feel special or happier than before?

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,960
When you're quiet, not talking, not being annoying,

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,640
you're actually quite cute.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm getting charmed.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,200
What? You want to go home?

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,640
Please, Achi.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,680
Please, Achi.

Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Alice, are you okay?

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,360
I think you should wait here. We won't be long.

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,720
No, I'm fine now. I feel better.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,560
Let me go with everyone. Please.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,280
Let Alice go too. That way my father won't worry.

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,800
I'll break the rules to help you just this once, Patty.

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,160
Thank you.

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
I promise I won't cause you any trouble,

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,960
and I won't ask you for anything again.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,960
But we don't have much time. You need to be careful too.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go. Get in the car.

29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,080
Why is senior so kind?

30
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Well... we work on the same team, so we have to take care of each other.

31
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
I see.

32
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Dad.

33
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
How are you, sweetheart? Are you doing well?

34
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm fine.

35
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
How's everything?

36
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,720
I miss you so much. How are you doing?

37
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm in the car right now, heading to see you at home.

38
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
Really?

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,520
Will it be dangerous?

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
No, it won't.

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,680
I just want to see your face for a moment, then I'll come right back.

42
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,520
Wait for me at the main gate, okay Dad?

43
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,480
See you, Dad.

44
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Okay.

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
Inspector Tee.

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,480
My daughter is coming home today.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,280
But she probably won't stay long, just a quick visit.

48
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Please don't scold her.

49
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
Because I really miss my daughter too.

50
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

51
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Patty!

52
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,200
Dad!

53
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,720
I've missed you so much, sweetheart.

54
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
I've missed you too, Dad.

55
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,920
How are you?

56
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm doing well.

57
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Take care of Patty.

58
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,920
Dad!

59
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,240
Dad!

60
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
Chama, watch Patty.

61
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,000
Dad!

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,600
Hey! Patty!

63
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,280
Dad, wake up!

64
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Dad, wake up!

65
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,760
Wake up, Dad. Listen to me.

66
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad, don't leave me, Dad.

67
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,760
Dad!

68
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Dad!

69
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Dad!

70
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
Get up!

71
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,760
Go!

72
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Your father is dead.

73
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
Do you want to die with your father?

74
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Come!

75
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,720
Let go! Let go!

76
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Go!

77
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,880
Go! Go!

78
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,400
Alice!

79
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,480
Hey!

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Hey!

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,320
Patty!

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Breaking news, viewers.

83
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,840
Mr. Phirom Siwatchaponkonkai,

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,280
a famous former politician, was shot while talking to his daughter,

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,080
and died instantly at the front of his house.

86
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,400
At the same time, the same CCTV camera
captured an unlicensed vehicle,

87
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,600
and a man in black grabbed Patty and her friend's arms and forced them into the car away from the scene.

88
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,920
This incident is considered a brazen act that shows no fear of the law.

89
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,240
We can't wait any longer.

90
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,600
We need to do something now.

91
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
I understand.

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,320
But we can't just rush in randomly.
There are only two of us.

93
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,320
Yeah, that's true.

94
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,360
We don't know how many of them there are.

95
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,280
Right.

96
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,480
We need to plan this carefully. Otherwise, both of us will die for sure.

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,440
But we should hurry.

98
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm afraid it might be too late.

99
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,200
If we delay, who knows what might happen.

100
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,400
I really want to know who they are.

101
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
I can't figure it out at all.

102
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,240
I don't know either.

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Normally, Mr. Phirom didn't have any enemies.

104
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,760
And Miss Patty never mentioned anyone her father didn't get along with.

105
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,880
What?

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Mr. Phirom and Miss Patty?

107
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Sigh...

108
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Sit down!

109
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
If you have something to say, say it.

110
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,880
Please don't be angry at us. It was necessary.

112
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,760
Besides, I didn't want Miss Patty to be in danger either.

113
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,160
So I had to do this.

114
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm such a disgrace as a detective.

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,760
Don't you know that impersonating Miss Patty like this is extremely risky?

116
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
You're literally putting yourself on the line.

117
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Why wouldn't I know?

118
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,920
You must really love Miss Patty.

119
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Yes.

120
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
I love her very much.

121
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
Like a real younger sister.

122
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,640
So when you were here, you've been helping Miss Patty all along.

123
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,360
Yes.

124
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Well, thinking about it, you two are quite similar.

125
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
So we almost got caught?

126
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,240
Yeah, especially that Miss Patty. What kind of bodyguard talks like that?

127
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Annoying. So annoying.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,120
Annoying. Annoying.

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,760
Yeah.

130
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,200
But someone around here secretly fell in love with her, right?

131
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,760
You know?

132
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
Yeah, I could feel it.

133
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,160
Whatever. Forget it.

134
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,800
I think I've figured out a plan for how to help those two.

135
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,960
Really?

136
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,840
Tell me.

137
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,960
You lead.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
I'll follow.

139
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
Let's do this.

140
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm ready.

141
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm ready too.

142
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:53,246
Supported by Pro Fresh Milk

143
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,728
What do you want? Americano?

144
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:00,788
I prefer it with milk.

145
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:05,272
Then I recommend this menu. Just add this milk and it's guaranteed to be delicious.

146
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,733
We use Pro Fresh milk,

147
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:13,158
which can enhance the flavor of coffee very well.

148
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:16,158
It froths easily and has a smooth, mellow taste.

149
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:34,771
Mmm.

150
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,775
It tastes so professional.

151
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,358
That good?

152
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,668
Can I have one cup, please?

153
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:45,728
Ready.

154
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,819
Let's go.

155
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,402
You should wait here.

156
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,760
No, I'm going with you.

157
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:12,628
We don't know how dangerous it is ahead or what we'll encounter.

158
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,868
Staying here is safer.

159
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:16,623
But we already talked about this.

160
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:18,354
I want to go.

161
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,739
But I'm a police officer.

162
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,244
I have to protect everyone.

163
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,838
But you can't do this job alone, Achi.

164
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,672
Don't forget that I'm a national-level shooting athlete.

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,914
If you want to succeed, you need me there.

166
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:33,613
- But...
- Don't "but" me.

167
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,061
And don't worry.

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,390
I've been through this kind of thing before. I know what I'm dealing with.

169
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,642
And another thing,

170
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,453
I also want to protect my younger sister and the person I love.

171
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,225
Okay.

172
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,061
Let's go then. Let's do this!

173
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:59,091
I think if we keep going straight, we should be there.

174
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,394
Yeah, good thing you know the way.

175
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:06,737
Yeah, really lucky that they didn't know Patty had her phone with her.

176
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,398
Did you worry so much that you had to put a GPS on her?

177
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,221
Well, just in case.

178
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,242
Is Patty's life really that dangerous?

179
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,948
You could say that.

180
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,790
And it's really sad too.

181
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:22,969
Why?

182
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:28,598
Well, she wasn't even 10 years old in Thailand when her mother died.

183
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,853
Just one day later, she had to go abroad for safety.

184
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,846
And when she came back to Thailand, she still had to hide.

185
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,653
Yes.

186
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:40,846
But I think Patty seems fierce.

187
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,703
She's fierce to hide her weakness.

188
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:45,781
Really?

189
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:48,257
Really. When she was there,

190
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:51,562
whenever she talked to her uncle on the phone, she would sit and cry alone every time.

191
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,328
Let's go.

192
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,314
I don't know what it's like inside.

193
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,139
Looking at the condition, it's probably been abandoned for several years.

194
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,870
Um, should we split up?

195
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:07,078
Okay.

196
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,128
I see an entrance on one side. I'll go that way.

197
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,524
I'll go this way.

198
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,741
Okay. Got it.

199
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm ready.

200
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:19,328
I'm ready too.

201
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:20,638
Don't be careless.

202
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,728
You too.

203
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:22,638
Let's go!

204
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,655
Hey! Wait a second.

205
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:27,958
I promise that if we both survive this, I'll set you up with Miss Patty.

206
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,878
Okay, thanks.

207
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:33,141
But if you like someone, tell me. I'll play matchmaker for you.

208
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,038
Okay.

209
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,112
- Go!
- Good luck.

210
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,258
Oh.

211
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:04,468
Officer Tee.

212
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,198
Did you come to help Chama and Patty too?

213
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:08,778
Yes.

214
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,928
I'm sorry, officer.

215
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,078
For taking Patty out without telling you.

216
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,198
And causing all this trouble.

217
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,368
It's okay.

218
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,128
But I'm not just sitting around doing nothing.

219
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,578
Let's finish this matter first.

220
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,228
Then you can punish me however you want.

221
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:23,758
I'll accept all responsibility.

222
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,558
Okay. Don't overthink it.

223
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,538
I'll go ahead first.

224
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:33,118
Wow, how long has no one been here?

225
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:46,708
Achi!

226
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:47,908
Achi!

227
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:49,378
Achi!

228
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,468
Achi!

229
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:51,018
Hey!

230
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:51,878
Achi!

231
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:52,668
What the hell is this?

232
00:16:53,238 --> 00:16:55,018
Patty, Chama.

233
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,418
Aunt Pin.

234
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:02,968
What the hell is this?

235
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,928
Well, awake now, darling?

236
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,418
Officer Tee.

237
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,848
Yes, it's me.

238
00:17:10,358 --> 00:17:11,498
Or...

239
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:15,378
It's exactly what you're thinking. You're right.

240
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:18,968
How could you do this? You're a police officer!

241
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,058
Yes, I'm a police officer.

242
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:23,718
So what?

243
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,398
You're despicable.

244
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,068
You can't say that.

245
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,168
Actually,

246
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:33,858
I just needed to deal with that old man Phirom and his daughter. That's all.

247
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:37,838
But because of your nosiness, getting involved,

248
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,158
everything got out of hand.

249
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,738
I'm putting you where you should be.

250
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,238
If you hadn't interfered like this,

251
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,968
Pin and I would have closed this job a long time ago.

252
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:55,958
Why did you do this?

253
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:57,948
How can you be so stupid?

254
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,848
It's because of money. What else would it be?

255
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:04,488
Is that all? Isn't that too simple?

256
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:05,388
Yeah.

257
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:07,238
Yes, that simple.

258
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,428
What a waste that I loved and respected you like a real brother.

259
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,558
If you want to blame someone,

260
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,938
you should blame your father.

261
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:19,928
He didn't love his children equally. He lied, he cheated.

262
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,378
In the end, he loved his biological child like you more than me.

263
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,058
He took me in just for show.

264
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,938
I don't even get to use the family name.

265
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,628
Think about it.

266
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,658
Don't talk about Dad like that.

267
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,438
He's your father too.

268
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,058
Stop fighting, you two.

269
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,068
Let's start the game.

270
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,448
I don't want to be slow. I don't want to stay here long.

271
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:50,008
Dad is already dead. What more does Mom want?

272
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:50,858
Hmph!

273
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:55,718
You too. Hard to kill.

274
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:03,228
I sent thugs to kill you abroad so many times, but you always survived.

275
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:08,478
But today, you probably won't survive.

276
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,358
What did Dad and I do to upset you so much that you'd do this?

277
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,828
You want to know? I'll explain it to you.

278
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:31,058
Do you know that before your father got with your mother,

279
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:33,988
he was with me first?

280
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,438
Your father said he loved me so much.

281
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:41,528
Asked me to wait 3 months,

282
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,968
and he'd bring elders with a million-baht dowry to propose.

283
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:49,538
In the end, before the month was over,

284
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:56,188
he went and married Lady Ravi, your mother.

285
00:19:58,468 --> 00:20:01,518
Is your mother prettier than me? No.

286
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:05,708
Better than me? Not at all.

287
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,808
Do you know what the difference was?

288
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:10,928
She had money.

289
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,708
She had honor.

290
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,608
She had dignity.

291
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,358
Plus, she was a politician's daughter.

292
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:21,818
That's why your father left me.

293
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:28,888
He left me to give birth to a daughter alone

294
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:31,828
in a shabby rented room.

295
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:33,498
A daughter.

296
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:36,298
Yes.

297
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:38,528
I remember.

298
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,128
I struggled.

299
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,048
I called your father.

300
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:47,488
Just asked him to help with a little child support.

301
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,438
But your father never answered.

302
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,558
I went to his workplace.

303
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:58,808
Security chased me away like a pig, like a dog.

304
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,468
Hmph!

305
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:03,618
But after your mother died,

306
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:07,328
he came running to me right away.

307
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:12,638
A daughter.

308
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:14,318
Don't tell me...

309
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,138
A daughter.

310
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:23,258
Yes.

311
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:27,418
The daughter who grew up until now

312
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:30,008
is Alice.

313
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:34,998
The person you've been hooking up with all this time, Patty.

314
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,438
That Patty must die.

315
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:08,116
Sponsored by Loft Bangkok Hotel

316
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,954
CANALIS Airport Hotel

317
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,704
Did you come alone, Achi?

318
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:20,662
Yeah, alone.

319
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,049
I don't believe you.

320
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:26,380
Normally that Patty girl likes to come with her servant.

321
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,849
Where's that other one?

322
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:31,773
If she came, you'd see her. Do you see her?

323
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,176
Are you talking about Alice?

324
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,599
Yes.

325
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,594
I thought she'd definitely follow.

326
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,390
But Alice is my daughter.

327
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,816
But Pin's daughter doesn't act like a daughter at all.

328
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:47,340
She's on the enemy's side.

329
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,691
Think about it, Pin.

330
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:51,316
Right now our plan is almost successful.

331
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,609
Pin is about to have billions.

332
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:56,157
Would Pin allow anyone to ruin our plan?

333
00:22:58,536 --> 00:22:59,268
Never.

334
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:02,413
But can I talk to her myself?

335
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,266
Fine.

336
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,700
But if she ruins our plan,

337
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:10,704
I can't guarantee your daughter's safety, Pin.

338
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,281
Hey, you two.

339
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,811
Go check if anyone followed us.

340
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:23,188
Yes, Boss.

341
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:29,768
Are you okay, Chama?

342
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,516
Patty, I'm scared.

343
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,291
Don't be scared.

344
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:40,194
We'll get home safely for sure. Trust me.

345
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,561
Will anyone come to help us?

346
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,116
Yes.

347
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,434
I think Alice is probably here somewhere.

348
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:48,788
Alice won't get caught, right?

349
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,018
No way. Alice is incredibly skilled.

350
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,900
She won't get caught and will come rescue us safely for sure.

351
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:18,916
Mom.

352
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:31,136
The situation is normal, Boss.

353
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:33,003
No strangers entered the warehouse.

354
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,030
How is that possible?

355
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,127
Are you two sure?

356
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,668
Positive, Boss.

357
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,700
We two checked every corner.

358
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,209
Alright then.

359
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:47,394
If there's nothing, you two go do your duties.

360
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,916
Yes, Boss.

361
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:03,618
Alice.

362
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:08,422
It must be Alice for sure.

363
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:21,180
P'Tee

364
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:22,291
P'Tee

365
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:28,801
Don't, Mom.

366
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:31,331
That's enough.

367
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:35,487
Alice, you, back off.

368
00:25:35,716 --> 00:25:36,759
I'll kill her.

369
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,449
No, I won't back off.

370
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:45,251
I'm begging you, Mom. Don't do anything more wrong.

371
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:49,782
Get out. Or I'll shoot you too.

372
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,201
Go ahead, Mom.

373
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,916
If Mom doesn't see me as a daughter,

374
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:57,845
then Mom can shoot me.

375
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,637
Are you threatening me?

376
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:02,540
I'm not threatening.

377
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,401
I'm begging you, Mom.

378
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:10,241
Please.

379
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,925
Would you really die for her?

380
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:18,826
I'm your mother. You should be on my side.

381
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:25,470
How can I be on your side when you're doing something wrong?

382
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:32,178
I'm your daughter. Shouldn't I be the one to change your mind?

383
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:36,963
Never.

384
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:43,125
That Phirom hurt me. He has to pay.

385
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:48,224
But Mr. Phirom is already dead, Mom.

386
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:52,847
But everything I did, I did for you, Alice.

387
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,868
He took everything from you.

388
00:26:57,226 --> 00:27:01,660
Everything should be yours. You should hate them.

389
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:06,844
But when Mom was with Mr. Phirom, weren't you living comfortably?

390
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,769
What more do you want?

391
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,154
Haven't you had enough?

392
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:14,643
No.

393
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:16,496
I'm not satisfied.

394
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:20,721
I'll take every baht, every satang.

395
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:23,938
That Patty must die.

396
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,944
Mom!

397
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:34,296
Mom!

398
00:27:34,818 --> 00:27:35,542
Mom!

399
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:38,620
No, Mom!

400
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:40,973
Mom!

401
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,066
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

402
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:50,534
I'm fine. I'm okay.

403
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,194
Mom.

404
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,453
I'm sorry for hurting everyone.

405
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,626
And I have to apologize to you too, Achi.

406
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:03,003
What are you talking about?

407
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,129
If I hadn't done this,

408
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:09,917
I might not have found out who was really behind this case.

409
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:12,321
Did it have to go this far?

410
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,967
You don't understand, Achi.

411
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:15,786
Anyway,

412
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:19,209
I'm going to call the police and an ambulance first.

413
00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,022
My mother is dead.

414
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,974
I have no one left.

415
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,683
I have no one left. I have no one left. I have no one left.

416
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:32,054
I have no one left. I have no one left.

417
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,201
Don't say that.

418
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,512
You still have me.

419
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:41,344
Alice still has Chama.

420
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,291
From now on,

421
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:54,569
wherever there's Alice, there will be Chama.

422
00:28:57,908 --> 00:29:01,234
And what's your purpose for coming back this time?

423
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:03,247
Well, I have to...

The case has been closed successfully.

429
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:39,794
For the major national news story,

430
00:29:39,804 --> 00:29:41,397
where criminals in black clothing

431
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:45,608
on motorcycles ambushed and shot Mr. Phirom Siwatchaponkonkai to death,

432
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:47,999
last night after the incident,

433
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:50,471
Police Captain Natee, or Inspector Tee,

434
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:53,844
led patrol forces to investigate and track down

435
00:29:53,854 --> 00:29:56,046
the hiding place,

436
00:29:56,056 --> 00:30:00,277
and found that the criminals had kidnapped Patty and her close friend

437
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:03,271
to an abandoned warehouse in Pathum Thani.

438
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:08,534
In the end, all the men in black along with Mrs. Pin Saengchan Thanluan, the new wife,

439
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:10,656
were captured by Inspector Tee, who suspects that

440
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:15,376
Mrs. Pin Saengchan Thanluan was likely the one who ordered everyone killed

441
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:18,492
hoping for the family inheritance of over a billion baht.

442
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:19,764
About Patty.

443
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:22,871
She hasn't gone back abroad yet. What are you going to do?

444
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:28,888
Don't worry. It's not over yet.

445
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:32,454
Because I have a second plan waiting for them.

446
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,176
Want to know what the plan is?

447
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:36,349
I do.

448
00:30:49,713 --> 00:30:52,025
- Hello.
- Hello. Checking in?

449
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:53,700
Yes, room 601.

450
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:56,677
May I have your ID card or passport, please?

451
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,578
- Hello.
- Hello. Checking in?

452
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:02,404
Room 602.

453
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:04,324
Sure, may I have your ID card or passport, please?

454
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,225
Chama!

455
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:07,616
Achi!

456
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:13,267
Tell me, what are you doing here?

457
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,246
I came to take care of business.

458
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:18,277
Does Chama have to report everything to Achi?

459
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,107
But,

460
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:24,340
did Achi come here to meet someone?

461
00:31:25,212 --> 00:31:26,079
No.

462
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:28,206
I just came to hang out.

463
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,044
You look very free.

464
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,111
But you,

465
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:35,881
you didn't come here to secretly follow me, did you?

466
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,201
No way.

467
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:39,949
I don't like you anymore, Achi.

468
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,467
So stop being so confident.

469
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:43,852
Gosh!

470
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:53,182
And why are you making that pouty face? What's wrong?

471
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:54,601
Heartbroken?

472
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,841
What heartbreak?

473
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:58,976
But,

474
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,349
have you seen Alice?

475
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:03,313
Well... I've seen her a bit.

476
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,584
Really? Where?

477
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:08,951
And Achi, have you seen Patty?

478
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:11,364
No, I haven't seen her at all.

479
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:14,745
It's been so long. Don't you miss each other at all?

480
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,867
My heart is completely broken.

481
00:32:21,945 --> 00:32:22,690
Achi!

482
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:24,959
Achi!

483
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:27,184
Achi!

484
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,349
Hello, Achi.

485
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:32,492
Alice, sit down first.

486
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:43,620
What is Alice doing here?

487
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,555
Well... came to see Chama.

488
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,542
A little reserved, that's okay.

489
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:59,650
And did Alice come alone?

490
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,389
No.

491
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:05,785
I came with Chama.

492
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,399
So what about you two?

493
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,774
Are you dating now?

494
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:22,462
Well... I think so.

495
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,029
Um, Achi, want to have dinner together?

496
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:31,869
No thanks, I can smell the romance.

497
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,286
Then... shall we go?

498
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,376
Yeah, I'll go first, Achi.

499
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,161
Enjoy your meal.

500
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,397
May I sit with you?

501
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,355
Senior.

502
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:22,993
Junior.

503
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:31,759
From now on...

504
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:35,984
Wherever there's Alice, there will be Chama.

505
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,644
Chama-Alice.

506
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,584
Alice-Chama.

507
00:34:46,555 --> 00:34:47,431
Fine.

508
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:41,014
So in this story, I was the one who got fooled from start to finish?

509
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,896
Huh! Who fooled you?

510
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:48,784
Alice or Chama?

511
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:50,959
I'll deal with them for you.

512
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:53,304
You.

513
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:54,715
Huh!

514
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:56,332
Me?

515
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,384
No way.

516
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:00,631
Yes.

517
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:05,284
So what was your purpose for coming back this time?

518
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:09,532
Well... to see you.

519
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:16,384
Then... let me ask one more question.

520
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:21,313
Do you love me, or are you deceiving me?

521
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,237
Well, I have to...

522
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,500
Love you!

523
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,915
Please don't be angry at us.

524
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,707
We had to do it this way.

525
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,060
Yeah, it was necessary.

526
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,044
It's my fault.

527
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,479
I misspoke.

528
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:02,534
Please.

529
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,624
How did you feel just now when you confessed your love and she caught on?

530
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:12,784
I thought that all this time...

531
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:15,246
I've been playing it cool. It wasn't that obvious, was it?

532
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:18,224
Even though my look might not be ladylike,

533
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,675
Chama, you watch Patty. I'll be right back.

534
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:22,993
Wait!

535
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,022
What just fell?

536
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:33,911
A gun!

537
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,871
I saw it earlier. It fell down.

538
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,437
Fell down to the butt.

539
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,395
Nobody cares at all.

540
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:45,460
Move, move, move. Didn't hit. Didn't hit.

541
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:46,075
1, 2, 3!

542
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:54,555
You can be loose about it.

543
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,490
It's like... and the pose is quite cool actually.

544
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,037
And I'm really going to wear these shoes too.

545
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:02,749
Should you take these? No, no.

546
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:15,244
Go.

547
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:17,452
Alice finally arrived. You took so long.

548
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:19,410
Slept and dreamed twice before waking up.

549
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,224
So chill.

550
00:40:21,225 --> 00:40:23,170
I don't even know how to sleep anymore at this point.

551
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:25,024
