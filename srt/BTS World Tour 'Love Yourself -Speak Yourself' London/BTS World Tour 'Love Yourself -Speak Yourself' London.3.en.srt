1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,512
<Heading to London
where the European tour will begin>

2
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,347
<Nom>

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,150
What's on the menu?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,219
Figs! <Using Namjoon as a guide to choose what to eat!>

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,054
<Going in>

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,589
Figs, figs!

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,758
Namjoon, are you going into the book?

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,694
The only thing I can have is the steak!

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,263
Have the steak!
<Namjoon's pick>

10
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,597
<Okay! Got ya!>

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:35,602
<Some have chosen sleeping over eating>

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,910
<After hours of good sleep>

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,013
<SUGAR works on his music!>

14
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,583
<Jung Kook is hungry after waking up>

15
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,685
<Om nom Nom nom>

16
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,390
Jung Kook!
Feed me some snacks!

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,760
- Huh?
- (Comfy) Feed me some snacks. <Seokjin has become one with the cozy chair>

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,262
<It's super yummy~>

19
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,331
<Synchronizing>

20
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,770
Here comes a shrimp snack. Try and catch it. <Snacks
are precious Jung Kook is being super generous>

21
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,106
Hobi, catch.
<Catch it if you can!>

22
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,076
<Catching and eating snacks
while lying down>

23
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,445
It fell on the floor.

24
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,980
No more! You can't catch it!

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,048
Yes, I can.

26
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,683
<Second attempt!>

27
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,820
Stealing right away.
<But that's my precious...>

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,255
I was going to be very upset, j-hope.

29
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,091
<A hard-won crisp tastes better>

30
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,293
I have *chip!
<What a good news>

31
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,962
We can eat it now, j-hope.

32
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:35,929
- Take my hand.
- Do you want it now?

33
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,865
- Can I get my *chip please?
- j-hope! <So happy...!>

34
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,834
Do I have the upper hand now?!

35
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,703
J-hope!
<Dizzy>

36
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,706
What will you do for me? <Gathering
in front of the man of power>

37
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,608
<Doing the flower cup hands>

38
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,044
I won't do anything!

39
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,548
<i>*chip is crazy good.
<A bag of chips has made B TS happy></i>

40
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,916
Taste of Korea!

41
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,417
It's good because we're sharing.

42
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,019
It's good.

43
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,054
It feels like we're on a school trip!

44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,297
<Feeling like excited boys on a school trip,
B TS arrived in the UK, the mecca of pop music!>

45
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,770
Is this Wembley?

46
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,608
We're now in Europe where you injured your leg
(during the last year's tour), Jung Kook!

47
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,043
I'll make up for last year!

48
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,545
<Excited>

49
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,651
<Wembley Stadium greets BTS>

50
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,153
<Finally in Wembley!>

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,121
It's huge.

52
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,061
It's different from what I saw on TV. It's smaller than I thought.
<Seeing it in person The stadium is smaller than expected...!>

53
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,865
- Our standard...
- Our standard must have gone up. <Our expectation is raised by all the huge venues we've seen!>

54
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,800
It's huge.

55
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,770
It's like two
PM right now!<It's actually 8pm The sky is still bright like 2pm>

56
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,372
I mean, I can't believe it's 8:10 right now.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,743
"KORE"''s pretty. Tell us about what you're
wearing. <Tell us about the pretty KORE jacket!>

58
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:03,183
This "KORE" jacket was a gift
j-hope got me from America.

59
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,455
The detail... This decoration on the pocket
is the eye. <Perfect down to the details!>

60
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,423
Really?

61
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:14,227
As soon as I saw it, I knew it
belonged to Jin so I bought it.<I must get this! Jj-hope knew at a glance that Jin would like it>

62
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:19,666
I'll be wearing this all the time while we're
in Europe. <KORE will tour Europe with Jin>

63
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,201
"KORE"!

64
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,238
<Jung Kook is busy
capturing Wembley with his phone>

65
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,908
<Prank mode ON>

66
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,079
<Jung Kook hasn't noticed>

67
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,281
<Glance>

68
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,052
<How come you are there?>

69
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,027
Even if the sand glitter cracks, <The original
lyrics: Even if the sandy ground cracks>

70
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,395
What? What?

71
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,697
- What? what?
- What's glittering? <Calling for an encore What's glittering...?>

72
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,701
No matter who harasses this world <The original
lyrics: No matter who shakes this world>

73
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,671
<The original singer likes
the recreated lyrics>

74
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,440
What? Who harasses this world?

75
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,512
<The rehearsal begins with "Dionysus">

76
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,953
<Half excited, half nervous
B TS stands on the stage of their dream>

77
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,260
Oh, really? <Q. How did you react to
the news of you going to Wembley?>

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,463
That's what I thought...
That's what I said, I think.

79
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,865
I was like, "We are?”

80
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,633
"Wow! Why?"

81
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,438
"Will there be that many ARMY?" <V
couldn't believe so many ARMY would come>

82
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,574
I guess I just couldn't believe it.

83
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,614
I was really excited because Wembley is my dream
stage. <SUGAR was very excited for Wembley>

84
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,082
Are we really going there?

85
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,852
I didn't even think
(that we could go to Wembley).

86
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:50,157
I wouldn't dare think of it
out of embarrassment.

87
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,893
I tend to do bad
when I'm nervous.

88
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:59,432
So I thought I should relax a little.

89
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:03,069
It wasn't just like,
"B TS has come so far."

90
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,106
<i>B TS.. How far are we going...?</i>

91
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,377
That's what I thought
and I was really excited.

92
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:19,052
At the time, the movie "Bohemian Rhapsody” was really popular.
<Heard the news when "Bohemian Rhapsody" was in the theaters!>

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,958
I heard the seats
were sold out.<BTS has become the 12th artist to sell out Wembley>

94
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,729
We took another step up.
We've come so far.

95
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,232
We're loved so much.

96
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,801
Those thoughts crossed my mind.

97
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:40,340
We're going to a really huge stadium. I'll see how huge
it is myself. <Jin wanted to see how huge Wembley is>

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,008
That's what I thought.

99
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,947
The moment I was impressed was
when we first arrived at Wembley.<It started to feel when he arrived at Wembley>

100
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,283
We're here.
We are here at last.

101
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,354
<During the rehearsal Namjoon's
new customized MIC has arrived!>

102
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,392
- It's different.
- Namjoon's looks so cool! <Not too happy because the head and the decoration color look different>

103
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,595
- I think it should be darker.
- It's so cool!

104
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,429
It'll be okay.

105
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,433
Let's see. Do you like it?
<Came to see the new MIC>

106
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,501
Shouldn't the colors match?
Yours and mine.

107
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,370
- It doesn't match.
- Mine doesn't match either.

108
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,906
Yours didn't match from the beginning.

109
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,075
- Maybe because this part is changed.
- Give us music please.

110
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,309
Then would you switch with me?

111
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,077
Nope!

112
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,311
- Then... Just the head?
- I like it!

113
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,280
<Aww T_T>

114
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,855
<The group rehearsal
ends with "FIRE">

115
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,427
<Moved on to rehearse "The Truth Untold">

116
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:48,041
<Jimin is worried about his voice>

117
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,018
<Good job!>

118
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:03,957
<Can't play music due to the time limit policy
They'll have to rehearse with their in-ears>

119
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,694
<Taehyung wants to rehearse
some more>

120
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,363
<Snooping>

121
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,202
I can hear the music!
I'll dance the choreo!

122
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,042
<] think he did this here?!>

123
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:29,249
<Taehyung gets the feeling of "Euphoria"!>

124
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:37,424
<No problem flying on my own!>

125
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,499
<Jungkook's "Euphoria” never gets old>

126
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,307
Would you be able to do that?

127
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,575
<Serious>

128
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,844
I guess I could.
But I don't want to...!

129
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,747
Isn't it amazing that he does
that? <Amazing how he does that>

130
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,848
I'd be terrified.

131
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,152
<Jungkook finished
the rehearsal without music>

132
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:13,960
It's huge. It's really huge. <Wembley
looks even bigger off the stage>

133
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,130
It looks even bigger from here.

134
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,836
<The last song to rehearse tonight is "Love">

135
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,507
<RM thoroughly checks out
the improved AR effects>

136
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,178
<Please look forward to the show tomorrow!>

137
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,514
It's about time
we'd be performing "MIC Drop".

138
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,349
But the sun hasn't gone down yet!

139
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,617
Really?
<Whoa>

140
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,553
I wish it wasn't
too bright during the medley.

141
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,356
The days are so long here.
<Take a good rest and see you tomorrow!>

142
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,592
Bye!

143
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,399
<The members each picked
a question related to a song>

144
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,668
I think I look the coolest when I'm rapping. <"DOPE" Q. In
which performance did you think you looked the coolest?>

145
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,405
I feel most like myself
and think I'm cool

146
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:03,610
when I'm rapping and casually
having fun with people without choreo.

147
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,412
Well?

148
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,550
I'm really cool in all of them!

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,419
I can't just pick one.

150
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,723
It'd be cool to perform on grass in the middle of the day. <"DOPE"
Q. What would you do if you can plan an unusual show with ARMY?>

151
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,260
I would also like
to perform in a park.

152
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,962
I want to perform
in a small venue someday

153
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:28,234
sitting down like this or just standing.

154
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,303
I'll definitely do it someday.

155
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,572
Please come join me.

156
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,575
A god who eats, sleeps and does nothing all day.
<"Dionysus" Q. Which Greek god would you be?>

157
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,312
I always wanted to be like him.

158
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,449
You live only once so how cool
would it be to live like that?

159
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:48,388
There are gods like
Apollo and Zeus but,

160
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:53,960
I don't think I can
live up to such great gods.

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,196
I'd live a life in sloth.

162
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:01,234
When the audience cheer when I'm up on stage. <"Dionysus” Q.
Dionysus is the god of ecstasy, when are you most ecstatic?>

163
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:06,139
When I was a trainee,
someone said this in a lecture.

164
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,376
"If you don't know the feeling,
you really don't know. Only a few do."

165
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,747
"That's what we go on stage for,"
he said.

166
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,451
I didn't know either but now I do.

167
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,186
I go on stage for that feeling.

168
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,189
<"Mikrokosmos" Q. If you could
name a planet, what would it be?>

169
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,492
Probably SUGAR?
<SUGA all the way>

170
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,428
SUGAR 333!
<With an identification number>

171
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,898
I like the number 3, so three of them...
<Triple what you like!>

172
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,034
To survive in space, <"Mikrokosmos" Q. What are
three things you'd bring on a trip to space?>

173
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,239
I'd bring something like
an emergency escape pod.

174
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:44,277
I saw "Iron Man" starve so emergency
food. <Learned from indirect experience>

175
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:49,616
And maybe a camera.
Even in an emergency

176
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:53,153
I would have something
to show people when I come back.

177
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,121
<"Mikrokosmos"
Q. Which member would you bring to space?>

178
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,391
Well...
<Thinking hard>

179
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,928
I might need some muscle
so Jung Kook?

180
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,632
Home! <"Wings" Q. Where would
you go right now if you had wings?>

181
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,535
I want to make a quick trip home.

182
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,271
I'd lie on the sofa with my dog,
<True relaxation>

183
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:15,108
munching on snacks and watching TV.

184
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,245
It's not much
but it makes you feel so much better.

185
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:24,584
I think it feels more precious because I stay abroad so much.
<Small things you get to appreciate more while staying abroad>

186
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,153
Small things make me very happy.

187
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,156
I hate
all bugs!<I|WingSll Q. Which bug are you the most scared of?>

188
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,427
I wish they will just
go away from me.<Bugs, please don't go near Hobi>

189
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,264
I really want to say it's our members
<"Anpanman" Q. Who is your superhero?>

190
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,699
and our fans.
<Jimin's heroes are the members and ARMY!>

191
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,270
I am not lying, I really mean it.
<I'm not just saying!>

192
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:49,342
I was knocked down so many times
but I don't remember

193
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:54,080
anyone giving me courage or
staying by me so I can keep going.<Before meeting the members and ARMY>

194
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,052
But that's what I get from
the members and the fans.

195
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:05,892
I thought that I want to be
my own hero from now on.

196
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,395
I've always said I want to teleport. <"Anpanman"
Q. Which super power would you want?>

197
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:14,667
I should take better care of myself
like work out but I can't.

198
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:20,840
And I tend to get weak when I'm in the plane.
<Long-haul flights make Jilin feel exhausted>

199
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,277
If I could teleport, I wouldn't need to worry
about that. <Teleportation will solve everything!>

200
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,478
So...

201
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,349
I could go abroad
and back to Korea really quickly.

202
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,284
Saving time.

203
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,753
Like I always say, my dad! <"Boy With
Luv" Q. Who was your childhood hero?>

204
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:40,526
Heroes make you go,
"WOW!"

205
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,230
And even small things
they do look so cool.

206
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,368
I was raised by my grandmother
and my dad used to come every weekend.

207
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:55,575
In his car, he had
a box of coins for toll fees.

208
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,280
He'd grab a handful of coins and say,
"Taehyung, here."

209
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,082
It made me so...
<Young Taehyung: "My dad is the best!">

210
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:09,188
I believe I'm here thanks to
his support and encouragement.

211
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,792
The members and my family! <"Boy With Luv" Q. What kept
you going when you wanted to give up on your dream?>

212
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:18,531
When I was a trainee,
I experienced a slump.

213
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:24,537
I even wanted to quit
being a trainee.

214
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,308
And they gave me so much courage.

215
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:35,415
And for the first time, I told my dad
that I didn't want to be a trainee.

216
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:40,386
I cried telling him it was too tough.

217
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:44,090
"You don't have to do it
if you don't want to."

218
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,227
"I support you with all my heart whatever you
do." <Dad believed in Taehyung and supported him>

219
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,330
That's what he told me.

220
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,199
And it gave me so much strength.
<His quiet support helped me so much>

221
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,436
Age? <"Best Of Me" Q. What do you
think makes you the best among B TS?>

222
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,071
Age?
<I'm the youngest...>

223
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,139
I don't know.

224
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,809
I'm not trying to brag but...

225
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,678
I guess I'm...
<Hesitant>

226
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,849
Born with many talents.

227
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,020
I'm not bragging. It doesn't mean I don't try. <You
are the golden baby who is good at everything!>

228
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,755
Please don't hate me.

229
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,360
There are two things. I learned one of them only recently. <"Best
Of Me"” Q. What are the important things for a good performance?>

230
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,197
(Before the show,) we always go,
"BANGTAN BANGTAN BANG BANGTAN".

231
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:31,003
But a concert isn't something
we can do on our own.

232
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,873
And not all the staff
can come together but,

233
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:39,812
if just a few from each field could
come together, say what they think,

234
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:44,851
and shout out the slogan together,
it'll make a difference.

235
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:49,422
Teamwork is important!

236
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,158
And the other thing is the noise!

237
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,395
Before going on stage,
I take out my in-ear.

238
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,330
On one or both sides
so I can hear the shouting.

239
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,300
That sound really pumps you up.

240
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,239
So it's important
to listen to the noise before I go.

241
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,947
<ARMY filling the whole area around Wembley
from early in the morning>

242
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,253
I purple you!
<Seokjin dyed his own hair purple>

243
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,755
I think you are the star of the night.
You'll have to do a good job.

244
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,556
I purple you!

245
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,124
You are the star of Wembley.
<Proud>

246
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,993
- You're the star of purple.
- The Star Wem?

247
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,632
Jung Kook is feeling great today.

248
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,533
Because I'm in Europe!

249
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,934
<Huh...?>

250
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,602
Did you say New York?

251
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,370
Europe

252
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,738
<What about Europe?>

253
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,940
I couldn't perform
last year in Europe!

254
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,775
Oh...!

255
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,111
- Don't shower while you're in the UK.
- Jung Kook, you won't stretch, right? <Showering + stretching is banned for Jung Kook in the UK>

256
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,846
I'm not going to get hurt.
Don't you worry.

257
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,818
Jung Kook got injured so we tried to fill in
for him, <Already been a year since the injury>

258
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,853
then I got a strained muscle, right?

259
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,889
I pulled my muscle during "FAKE LOVE" and couldn't
perform on TV. <Now they can talk about it with a smile>

260
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,891
- We went on without Jung Kook and Jilin.
- A pulled muscle!

261
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,426
I really can't get hurt!

262
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,295
I have unresolved issues
with Europe!

263
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,197
I felt so bad back then...

264
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:08,267
That was our greatest crisis without Jung Kook and Jilin.
<Felt the absence of the two in "The Graham Norton Show">

265
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,369
I tried to do it alone...

266
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:16,476
I still think "IDOL" at the Graham Show is the greatest
crisis we've faced. <Still feel dizzy thinking about it>

267
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,276
That was really...

268
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:22,215
But people said...
It was like a new edition or something!

269
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,816
Such performance...

270
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,984
Jilin & Jung Kook Edition!

271
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,719
They've never seen such a performance
(where Jilin and Jung Kook aren't there)!

272
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:33,459
It worked out in the end but it was no joke back
then. <The rest tried so hard to fill in for the two>

273
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,763
We're a team so if any one of us isn't there, <Q. How do you
feel to be back in London where you got injured after a year?>

274
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,433
I don't think we can give out
the same synergy and energy

275
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,402
no matter how hard the rest try.

276
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:51,010
I got injured back then... and was less than perfect.
<Jung Kook felt really bad for the sub-par performance>

277
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,613
It always troubled me.

278
00:16:54,046 --> 00:17:00,620
I want to make up for what I couldn't do for the fans at the time.
<Jung Kook wants to make up for last year by trying harder on stage>

279
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,658
So I can give them good energy.

280
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,129
<Getting ready for the press conference!>

281
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,401
I'm in trouble, I feel too sick!
<Jin is getting ill>

282
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,804
<Hobi is ready!>

283
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,941
I'm already tired.
<Already tired T-T>

284
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,414
<Trying to fill up energy from fruits>

285
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,887
<How to enjoy fruit
It tastes even better when you share!>

286
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,626
<BTS in suits
Taking pictures before the press conference>

287
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,234
Oh, I'm hungry!
I should've had the cocoa spread! Oh, seriously!

288
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,201
Oh...!

289
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,037
I should've had the cocoa...
<Namjoon, shh!>

290
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,872
<A good boy>

291
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,640
Is cocoa spread that important?
<Kidding>

292
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,975
Of course it is!

293
00:17:55,975 --> 00:18:00,079
Carbs are important!

294
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,215
<From all over the world
About 100 reporters at the press conference>

295
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,853
We'll enjoy it
and do our best as always

296
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,690
to write a new history of B TS
in this historic place.

297
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:17,029
<Questions poured in
since Wembley has great significance>

298
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,534
No one could have imagined it! <Q. How do you feel
about being the 12th artist to sell out Wembley?>

299
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,469
No one in the world...

300
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:27,173
No one among the 7.5 billion population
would have thought it.

301
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,509
I'm surprised and pleased.

302
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,945
It's only possible

303
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,549
thanks to the fans
who come to see us.

304
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:41,787
So we kept talking about
how thankful we are.

305
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,824
Sometimes, I'm terrified.

306
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,961
"Are we able to
walk down this path?"

307
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,031
"Can we walk down this path?"

308
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:58,871
"How blessed are we
to have these amazing shows”

309
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:04,677
"and be loved by so many people?”
We always think this.

310
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:11,550
People around us emphasized
the significance of going to Wembley.

311
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,121
So I was very nervous.

312
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,323
I think I was especially nervous
on the first day of the show.

313
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,527
But I tried not to think
that it's any different.

314
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,296
After all, they are our fans
(coming to the show).

315
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:29,468
As soon as I heard the question, I thought of "forever".
<Q. Which modifier do you want to see before "B TS"?>

316
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,771
Forever B TS.

317
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,474
Nothing can last forever.

318
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,412
But I'd like to think we'll last forever
so that's why I want that.

319
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,447
Forever B TS!

320
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:46,485
I think I want to see "always".

321
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,286
Always.

322
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,756
Rather than being "the first" or "the best",

323
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:58,531
I think it's better
to stay together for always.

324
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,302
"Of course B TS!"

325
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,871
I would like to
see something like that.

326
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,375
I just want us before us,

327
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,013
instead of being something
someone else has already done.

328
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:21,654
I hope it's like,
"B TS, going the right way."

329
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:26,192
To be honest, I don't think
modifiers really matter now.

330
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:29,495
I think it's good enough

331
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:33,299
if our fans want to see
our show "just because it's B TS".

332
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:39,138
For example, people say "innovative",
"the first", "B TS did it again”.

333
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,142
But that doesn't mean
we are not good anymore

334
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:47,012
if we don't get to do things
for the first time in the future.

335
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,848
Instead of "something” B TS,

336
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:53,819
I hope we are just B TS. <Jimin wants
"B TS" to mean something on its own>

337
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:59,391
I hope we'll be a team
that has the meaning on its own.

338
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,095
People call us
"the Beatles of the 21st century.

339
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:12,805
It's an incredible honor and I'm grateful
to hear that. <We're honored and grateful>

340
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:19,011
But I still want to be just B TS instead
of the Beatles of the 21st century.<But Jung Kook wants to be just BTS>

341
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:25,684
B TS like no other!

342
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,187
I want to be something new.

343
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,422
New people!

344
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,560
B TS as sort of its own brand

345
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,165
so people will know
"B TS" as just "B TS".

346
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:43,803
We say to a good dancer,
"You're like Michael Jackson."

347
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,840
We say to a good singer,
"You're like so-and-so."

348
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,575
You're like B TS.

349
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,811
B TS like B TS.

350
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,912
The first B TS.

351
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,713
The B TS of the 21st century.

352
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,581
Something like that.

353
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,285
Cute... B TS!

354
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:05,357
I wish our cuteness is highlighted.
<Let the world know how cute B TS is!>

355
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,327
But you can't know unless you're a fan. <Finding
someone cute is the ultimate level of affection>

356
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,762
So I guess it'd be hard
for the outsiders to call us that.

357
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:15,568
The guys are cute so it'd be nice to highlight their
cuteness. <Every one should know how cute the members are!>

358
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,337
Me?
<Q. When do you think you're cute?>

359
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,675
I'm not really cute...

360
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:28,314
If I went around smashing things
people won't like that

361
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,182
I don't think I'm cute.

362
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,418
Maybe when I'm eating.

363
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,520
When I'm stuffing myself...!

364
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,156
If I have to say it!

365
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,793
I can't wait!
<I'm too hungry to wait any longer!>

366
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,627
All right!

367
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,563
Do you eat the crust?

368
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,798
Do you eat the crust?

369
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,999
I don't!

370
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,234
I don't like it either.
<Me neither!>

371
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,502
You're just like me.
<The two have the same taste>

372
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,604
Sometimes I eat it though.

373
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,808
I rarely eat it!

374
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,611
I won't eat it
since you don't eat it!

375
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,379
Should I have the chocolate spread or the strawberry
jam? <Chocolate spread vs. strawberry jam>

376
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,147
Strawberry jam.
<Taehyung's pick is the strawberry jam>

377
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,450
But that's too sweet!

378
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,885
You don't know a thing!

379
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,153
Going with strawberry jam? No, I'm in the mood for the chocolate today.
<Namjoon chooses the chocolate spread he's been craving from earlier>

380
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,990
I can't have anything
an hour before the show.

381
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,091
It's just a slice of bread.

382
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,994
Give me the crust.
<j-hope likes to eat the crust!>

383
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,830
I feel so weak.

384
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,866
I need to fill up my energy.

385
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,003
<Dollop of the spread>

386
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,707
<Lots of the strawberry jam for Taehyung'!>

387
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,511
So good.
<Already so good'!>

388
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,181
<Big bite>

389
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:46,525
<ARMY has come in to the stadium
and now waiting for the show to start>

390
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,663
No problem with the medley? Jump a lot during the
medley. <The final discussion before the show!>

391
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,964
Let's have fun today.

392
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,966
The sun is still up
so you've got to move a lot.

393
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,302
We'll have to try harder
since the sun is still up.

394
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,338
When we're on stage,

395
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,574
we can still see who is singing.

396
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,411
Why don't we try not to pass by
in front of the person... <Delicate>

397
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,046
Of course!
That's just sensible.

398
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:07,980
Have I done it?

399
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,815
J-hope did it...

400
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,450
<Huh>

401
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,584
Just sensible.

402
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,955
During "Best Of Me", I had about this much
<What happened during "Best Of Me"...!>

403
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,890
distance to the end
when I was singing.

404
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,592
And j-hope passed by
in front of me.

405
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,196
I'm sure we're all being careful.

406
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,532
We try not to pass by the center, of course
since the camera's rolling.

407
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,434
I'm sure it's the same for everyone.
<Let's try and be a little more careful!>

408
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,969
Let's be more careful.

409
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,603
I'll be more careful.

410
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,873
There are so many cameras.
<Taking a break after the discussion>

411
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,675
Say something to the cameras.
An official announcement.

412
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,810
Please explain yourself.

413
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,245
Why did you
dye your hair purple?

414
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,382
The reason why I dyed my hair purple is,

415
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,385
I saw a character called Phantom while I was playing Poke() game
on my phone. <Jin's purple hair was inspired by a game character>

416
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,686
Phantom is strong.

417
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,154
I really liked that it's purple.

418
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:49,822
Okay!

419
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,591
Let's try again.

420
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,060
<Back to stretching>

421
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,228
Huh?

422
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,398
Someone spilled the strawberry jam!

423
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,333
Before... Taehyung was there...

424
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,036
Agh, ah, uh, ahh, oh!

425
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:08,140
<Hahaha
An attack of the strawberry jam>

426
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,044
Taehyung!

427
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,248
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but...
<The strawberry jam prince has something to say!>

428
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,049
I love you...

429
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,817
- Taehyung, you're so cool!
- I love you too.

430
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,786
Familiar tone just for today.

431
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,287
Namjoon, I love you!

432
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,722
You think you're so cool?

433
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,692
Taehyung, you're so cool.
<Taehyung can do anything he wants!>

434
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,294
Jin will be the star of the night.
<Excited>

435
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,130
- Jin will do a good job.
- He looks so cool today.

436
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,266
- Seokjin, I purple you!
- Purple!

437
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,202
What if purple water
drips down from his hair?

438
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,704
I purple you!

439
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,339
He's going to end up like Thanos.

440
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,576
<The show is about to start>

441
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:50,382
<The mood is already heated up>

442
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,187
Let's be global!

443
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,688
BANGTAN! BANGTAN! BANGBANGTAN!

444
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:05,130
<All ready to go on stage>

445
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,074
<ARMY's loud cheer welcomes
B TS to the stage>

446
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,710
<The first show in Wembley finally starts>

447
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,288
<Opening the show
with a strong performance>

448
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:35,561
We're finally having a stadium tour
here in Wembley!

449
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,404
<Wembley is filled with heat
from the opening performance>

450
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,179
It's hot in here!

451
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,017
I wasn't feeling well today
but I feel better on stage.

452
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,821
<The solo performances begin
with j-hope's "Just Dance">

453
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,291
Wembley, let me hear your voice! Let's go!

454
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,938
<The mood is even hotter
with the wave summoned by Hopeseidon>

455
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:24,409
<After j-hope's refreshing performance,
it's "Euphoria” time>

456
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:33,252
<Jung Kook takes over the sky of Wembley
looking all relaxed>

457
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,257
<ARMY ~ See you soon!>

458
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,861
<Jimin appeared on stage
in the bubble ball for "Serendipity"!>

459
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:47,366
<But the bubble ball didn't pop
on time, never happened before>

460
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,337
I wasn't really flustered and I just thought, <Q. Weren't you
flustered when the bubble ball didn't pop during "Serendipity"?>

461
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,339
Should I tear it open to get out? <Jimin
thought about how to keep the performance going>

462
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,542
Should I stay seated,
or should I stand up?

463
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,544
I quickly thought of those things.

464
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,312
I decided to stay seated.

465
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:04,349
Because my head will touch the ball and it won't look pretty. <Kept
singing while sitting down to avoid touching the bubble with his head>

466
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,817
So I stay seated thinking,

467
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,188
"Maybe I'll rip it open
when I have to go down."

468
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,123
The director was watching me.

469
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:15,327
So I waited thinking
he'll solve this issue.

470
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,229
If this was before,

471
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:20,766
I would've panicked
and stopped singing.

472
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:27,573
<Jimin could've panicked
but finished it calmly like a pro>

473
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,912
I'll be good!
Today I'm...

474
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,049
Full of confidence!

475
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,651
- Good luck!
- Fighting!

476
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,023
Are you ready for Love?
<Here comes Namjoon!>

477
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:51,630
<A heart for ARMY
RM's performance is "Love" itself>

478
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:04,076
<Although we speak different languages
our love is the same!>

479
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,314
<The climax of the show
Now doing the Title Medley>

480
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,196
<BTS goes on
without sparing themselves>

481
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,834
Shows can't always be perfect.

482
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,669
Today's show won't be perfect either.

483
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:36,875
I don't think we'll ever do
a perfectly flawless show.

484
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:42,481
I wanted to release everything
for this concert.

485
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,583
So I just poured myself out.

486
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,818
I had a lot in me.

487
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,991
<After pouring out all the energy,
B TS gets ready for the next performance>

488
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,594
Ah, I'm exhausted.

489
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,063
I got carried away today.

490
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:05,370
<After the medley, V goes on to perform
"Singularity" without a break>

491
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:12,277
<No one can tell he's tired from
V's delicate expressions>

492
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:23,121
<And now "FAKE LOVE" starts>

493
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:40,172
<Finally catching their breath
behind the stage>

494
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,914
<First time performing it in daylight
The audience loved "Singularity" today'!>

495
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,349
Oh, really?

496
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,817
I didn't really like it.

497
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,052
"Singularity” needs to be in the dark!

498
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,856
But as long as the fans like it...
<Taehyung likes what ARMY likes!>

499
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,460
But "Singularity” is the best in the dark.

500
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,864
Why am I so tired?

501
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,434
There's an expression I use
in these situations.

502
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,471
We're losing to ARMY!

503
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,672
We won't lose.

504
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,541
They're having so much fun.

505
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,677
I got carried away.

506
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,546
Why did I?

507
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,251
I'm exhausted but it's so fun!

508
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,386
But something's off.

509
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,989
I feel like I can show more.
<Mr. Passion still feels he can do better>

510
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,592
I will try harder!

511
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,796
It takes more energy
to perform in daylight.

512
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,832
When it's dark, the battle is with myself.

513
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,201
When it's bright,
the battle is with everyone!

514
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,342
<SUGA's "Seesaw" kicks off
with the purple city in the background>

515
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,782
<Seokjin sings along
while heading out>

516
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:04,489
<SUGA presents
his signature relaxed rap>

517
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,395
<The last solo performance
Sweet melody of "Epiphany” starts>

518
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:19,004
<Jin sings in a perfect voice
even though he's ill>

519
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,313
<The purple wave>

520
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,317
<His throat isn't feeling well.
Can Jilin finish "The Truth Untold" stage?>

521
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,858
<Silent
BANGTAN BANGTAN BANGBANGTAN>

522
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:57,976
<Jimin's explosive singing
proves we didn't have to worry>

523
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,248
How come I'm so tired today?

524
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,450
Do you see how red my face is?

525
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,653
It's twice as hard today.

526
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,522
<Q. How would you rate
today's "Seesaw” out of 1007>

527
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:13,058
Out of 100...

528
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:13,992
Maybe 1107?

529
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,561
Usually it's 200.

530
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,630
But I was wound up today.

531
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,167
I really did my best.
<Jimin did his best for "The Truth Untold">

532
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:26,872
Thank you so much
for singing with me!

533
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,140
I hope my voice will be all better tomorrow.
<Hope it will be all better tomorrow!>

534
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:33,545
<The encore starts excitedly
with "Anpanman">

535
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,422
<BTS is happy and not tired
as long as ARMY is with them>

536
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,457
<Hug>

537
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,363
<We can't forget the ARMY Bomb wave!>

538
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,637
Wembley, make some noise!

539
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,708
London always gives me
unforgettable memories.<Including today SUGAR has only good memories in London>

540
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:09,347
Thank you for coming, London, Wembley.
Thank you so much! I love you!

541
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,821
Are you having fun tonight?

542
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:24,696
I recently watched
the film "Bohemian Rhapsody"”.

543
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:30,569
There're a few but Jin's "ay-oh!" was the best.
<Q. The most memorable moment in the show?>

544
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,872
He even pulled it off nicely.
I was surprised.

545
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,974
It seemed like
everyone was waiting for that.

546
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,845
It was like a real life edition of the movie.
<A real life edition of "Bohemian Rhapsody">

547
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,249
I got goose bumps
at that moment.

548
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,384
He did a great job.
<Of course!>

549
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:52,257
It's become a significant scene from our Wembley shows.
<Jin's "Ay-oh”™ has become BTS' another significant scene>

550
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,961
I saw the news articles about it.

551
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:59,431
And there were headlines like

552
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,499
"B TS shouts "Ay-oh" at Wembley".

553
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:06,438
I was unsure to the last moment
if I should shout it or not.

554
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:11,610
I looked up the videos
to memorize the order and all.

555
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:16,214
I was glad that ARMY shouted
it with me. <Thank you, ARMY!>

556
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:21,052
You are so lovely, ARMY!

557
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,658
<Jimin screams "ARMY" instead of "Ay-oh">

558
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,829
I love you so much
from the bottom of my heart.

559
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:41,072
I felt guilty because I couldn't
be in the shows and performances last year.

560
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,277


561
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,081
<BTS' first show in Wembley
successfully comes to an end>

562
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,864
Thank you so much!
One, two, three.!

563
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:06,831
Thank you.

564
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,003
<Sleep tight and see you tomorrow!>

565
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,374
Thank you.

566
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:24,883
I am B TS who performed in Wembley!

567
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:32,157
I took medicines for the cold
and it feels like my body is going to break.

568
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,959
<Looking around>

569
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,796
Where did my glove go...?

570
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,265
<Looking for a glove
I lost at Wembley!>

571
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:44,803
I think I dropped my glove on stage. <Must have
dropped it somewhere while running around excitedly>

572
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,107
I really need it.

573
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,675
Great job, j-hope!

574
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,010
Great job!

575
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,180
I said nothing's different
(at the press conference).

576
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,049
But I guess Wembley does
have a significance.

577
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:03,688
There's certainly something. It's difficult to
explain it though. <The feeling is hard to express>

578
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,757
It was so cool.
Thank you.

579
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,492
Can't believe it really happened.

580
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:11,896
If I die right now, I would have regrets
but I think I have less now.

581
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,201
Wembley is Wembley.

582
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,839
Wembley...
The venue we dreamed of!

583
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,075
I want thank the audience
for enjoying the show.

584
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:29,347
I also thank ARMY who watched it
live from all over the world.

585
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:35,086
We'll go take some rest for tomorrow.
Bye! <See you at the show tomorrow, ARMY!>

586
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:35,987
<Hello>

587
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,823
I was happy today! Thank you!

588
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:39,924
It was really fun.

589
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,861
- Everything aside, it was just really fun.
- It was.

590
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,263
Significance is important too
but it was just so fun.

591
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,700
Hey, you looked so cool when you did
that. <And Jin's unforgettable "Ay-oh">

592
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,669
I was worried if your voice would crack
but it was perfect, for real.

593
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,704
You were so cool!

594
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,439
It was like Freddie Mercury
came back to life!

595
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,574
Seriously, you were like
"Freddie Mercury Jin"!

596
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,809
It was fun...
<A fender bender>

597
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,177
Are you okay?
<Suddenly acting>

598
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,080
Are.You.Okay?
Did.You.Get.Hurt?

599
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,214
<I'm fine...!>

600
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,150
I had so much fun.

601
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,418
It was like Freddie Mercury
came back to life.

602
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,592
I had fun!

603
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,663
I'll do better tomorrow!

604
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,466
<Listening>

605
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,374
Are they singing together?

606
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:41,619
<Jung Kook stops and listens>

607
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,459
It's very moving...

608
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,898
People will think I'm a crybaby...
Oh! Maybe I am already.

609
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,533
<Lingering feelings>

610
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,903
It'll be an unforgettable
moment in my 20s!

611
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,851
<The next morning
B TS arrives at the stadium>

612
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,118
Hello!

613
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,555
Hello!
I'm hungry, so hungry.

614
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,360
<Still haven't recovered from last night>

615
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,095
I'm tired...

616
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,064
Tired...

617
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,534
<Still asleep>

618
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:34,339
I guess I went too hard yesterday.

619
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,041
I'll do my best today as well!

620
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,378
<Stretching>

621
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,551
My whole body is aching from the workout I did after the show last
night. <Amazing fitness Jungkook worked out after the show last night>

622
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:52,156
I did something wrong during the workout and my arm hurt
when I brushed my teeth. <Suffering from sore muscles>

623
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,092
<Half asleep>

624
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,260
Hello.

625
00:39:56,694 --> 00:40:03,301
My position was a bit off
during "Love" yesterday.

626
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:07,672
<For a perfect show
Adjusting the positions for the AR effect>

627
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,208
<Serious>

628
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,847
<Satisfied>

629
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:20,418
<RM has learned the positions clearly>

630
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,489
<Fascinated>

631
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,392
That's fascinating.
<Fascinated>

632
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,861
Here is Doctor Strange! <Doctor Strange
RM came to Wembley in search of Dormammu>

633
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,096
Here's Dormammu!

634
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,734
Mammu! Mammu! Mammu! <Dormammu! Jung
Kook also came for a deal to protect ARMY!>

635
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:43,374
<Next rehearsal is for Jilin!>

636
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,879
<Sat down on the front row!>

637
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,954
<Standing up and being a fan boy>

638
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,570
<Happy>

639
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,044
<Now it's Kkoogi's turn!>

640
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,616
<Jung Kook doesn't know Jilin is here>

641
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,751
<Found him>

642
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,523
<Feeling great!>

643
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,361
<Hey! I'm up here!>

644
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,033
<Jimin made
the flying even better!>

645
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,905
<But... It was not the end of it...?>

646
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,342
<Jung Kook is rehearsing "So What" alone>

647
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,710
<Wow that guy...>

648
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:58,916
<Jimin came back
to watch it from the front row>

649
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,499
<Now doing the sound check
with ARMY>

650
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,877
<BTS gets infinite energy
in front of ARMY>

651
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,828
Love you!
<See you at the show!>

652
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:46,364
Thank you.

653
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:51,903
<Jung Kook is doing push-ups while watching
the mafia episode of "Run B TS">

654
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,007
I think one person is suspicious.

655
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,110
I think Jung Kook is suspicious!

656
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:02,547
- Why? What's your reason?
- Because he isn't saying anything. <Me?!>

657
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:03,915
<Very interesting>

658
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:09,520
<Jung Kook's reaction
is the same as any ARMY>

659
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,858
I think, in the second round! We'll have to kill j-hope!
<j-hope is making a toast while listening to "Run B TS">

660
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,961
Why kill me?

661
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,698
<Carefully slice a banana>

662
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,267
<Place them on the bread covered in jam!>

663
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,736
<Yum>

664
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:32,643
<SUGA is getting ready
eating a tangerine!>

665
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,184
I want to eat tangerines
at a warm place this winter.

666
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,922
On a warm electric blanket.

667
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,158
I can eat a whole box.

668
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,860
Your hands turn yellow!

669
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:56,033
<It's like a festival in the stadium
with ARMY's singing!>

670
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:01,239
<BTS, we're waiting!>

671
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,041
Any issues in the Medley?
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

672
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,477
We could dial down the excitement a little.
<Having the final discussion together!>

673
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,545
That's true.

674
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,615
- But yesterday, it was being live streamed...
- We were excessively excited though. <Everyone was excited excessively yesterday>

675
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,583
- We went too hard yesterday.
- I'll get less excited today.

676
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,286
- You should've seen Jin yesterday.
- Why Jin?

677
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:16,487
It wasn't like this.

678
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,055
- It was something he's never...
- I didn't have time to look around. <Jin's cool gestures on stage really shined last night>

679
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,991
Because, I was going like this,

680
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,059
then I turned around
and Jin was going...

681
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:29,000
For the camera crane,
he was doing gestures like a rapper!

682
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,301
His energy...

683
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,669
SUGAR!
I have something to tell you!

684
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,905
- I did what I always do.
- When you sprayed water,

685
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,807
I was singing my part
here like this.

686
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,511
The water went all over me and it was all on camera. <SUGA
splashed water all over V on the thrust stage last night>

687
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,479
Must have looked cool!

688
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,181
<Let's see if it really
looked cool like SUGAR says!>

689
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,215
I can't say anything to that.

690
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,318
<Taehyung's striking a pose
during "So What">

691
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,287
<Running with a bottle of water>

692
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,660
<Wet>

693
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,296
<Ughh~>

694
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,398
And then, "MIC Drop".

695
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:04,001
"MIC Drop"...
It was so cool yesterday!

696
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:11,475
Hey, Namjoon, about "MIC Drop”, don't you think you come in a bit too
early? <RM & Jin Maybe joined in the "MIC Drop” too early at the beginning>

697
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,578
We don't go in when
j-hope is doing "krrr krrr".

698
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,046
We don't.

699
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,949
- How could you call it "krr krr"...?
- Isn't it "krr krr"? <Krr krr...? Hahaha>

700
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,018
He just said "krr krr"!

701
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,955
I went in to help out "krr krr" but...

702
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,060
<Krr Krr>

703
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:34,098
<BTS is heading to the stage now>

704
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,718
Let's do better than yesterday!

705
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,019
You ready?

706
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,120
We can't do better than yesterday!

707
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,887
Fighting!

708
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,889
BANGTAN! BANGTAN! BANGBANGTAN!

709
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:03,394
<The last show in Wembley
begins at last>

710
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,506
Welcome to B TS WORLD TOUR LOVE YOURSELF,
SPEAK YOURSELF, here in

711
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,576
London, Wembley Stadium!

712
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,713
<Next song, "Wings" starts>

713
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,616
<The fun of being in a stadium, B TS enjoys
the performance as if it's a festival with ARMY>

714
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,784
Before (the stadium tour)

715
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,820
It was more like,
"We've got to show something.”

716
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,890
But then we started
having shows in stadiums,

717
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,495
where the ceilings open and
we can use fireworks and special effects.

718
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,564
I thought,
"This really is a festival.”

719
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:47,972
"It's a show where I communicate
and have fun with the audience".

720
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,809
I love this atmosphere
where we can share our feelings.

721
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:56,347
- I'm ready.
- Stupefy! <We're in the UK! B TS learned magic from Hogwarts>

722
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,417
Firestorm!

723
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,791
<The Medley part
where they promised to dial down>

724
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:21,405
<Poured out all the energy
for the last show>

725
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:29,413
<Completely worn out after the performance>

726
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:41,992
I'm exhausted.

727
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,129
One minute till the next song.

728
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:50,234
<The rap line starts "Tear"
almost right away>

729
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:00,878
<Then, it's the powerful "MIC Drop">

730
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:18,929
The second show in Wembley has finally come
to an end. <Only the encore is remaining now>

731
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:24,201
It's a meaningful place
so it does feel different.

732
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:28,773
Thank you for having fun with us.

733
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,642
I hope we could
come back, Wembley!

734
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,310
I'll not forget this!

735
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,948
I had so much fun
in Wembley today.

736
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,918
Only if I wasn't feeling ill,

737
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,555
I could have had more fun,
so I feel so bad about it.

738
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:49,260
Next time, I'll come back
feeling all well

739
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,030
and do my best!

740
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,668
My dear ARMY in the UK!

741
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,203
Thank you so much.

742
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:04,642
Wembley...
The historic moment ends like this.

743
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:09,613
I believe ARMY and B TS
have written a new history.

744
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,650
It was such a fun show.

745
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:17,188
If I get a chance, I would
love to come back here

746
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:23,561
and reminisce the good times
with our fans.

747
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,729
Thank you so much, guys.

748
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:26,597
Heart!

749
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,568
We've received so much
it makes me think,

750
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:34,572
"Where in the world would I
be able to feel like this?"

751
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:40,711
Let's stay together
until I can give it all back.

752
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,280
Maybe till we're like 90 years old?!

753
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,483
I love you for real.

754
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:50,554
<The "Anpanman" kids cafe
is open in Wembley!>

755
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,160
<Give me!>

756
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,063
<Big bite>

757
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,132
It flew off... <Q. RM is the only voice of reason in B
TS, but did you lose it this time with the sunglasses?>

758
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,435
SUGAR found it for me.

759
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,704
Normally, I try and restrain myself so hard

760
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,206
not to lose control...

761
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,912
I try to avoid becoming a meme.

762
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,482
I have so many memes so it's okay.

763
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,351
I'm thankful in many ways. <Q. What do you
think when you see the members going wild?>

764
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:25,122
I'm like, "Okay... Do all you want.
Fighting, guys!”

765
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,625
And they are cute!

766
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,659
They're cute!

767
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:33,130
<Let's take a look at
the famous sunglasses scene!>

768
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:40,104
<A perfectly Namjoon-Llike ending...!>

769
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:45,109
This feeling, view, ARMY,
my heart is full.

770
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,979
See you there,
in my dream.

771
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:53,217
You are the answer, ARMY.

772
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,955
The answer of all my life!

773
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,393
These two nights were
just more than dreams.

774
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,461
Actually, it was better than dreams.

775
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:09,033
We had fun, right?

776
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:13,070
Thank you so much. I love you, for real.
<Time to sing the last song "Mikrokosmos">

777
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:18,409
<ARMY's surprise event>

778
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,983
At first, I thought we played a wrong track by
mistake. <The members thought it was a mistake>

779
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:28,752
This is a serious mistake.

780
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,689
Is it like a prank?
That's what I thought.

781
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,234
I was really happy
at that moment.

782
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,671
Other guys cried
I teared up too but,

783
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,708
it came to my mind,
"Isn't this a happy moment?"

784
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:55,479
So I just smiled a lot
to take in that happy moment.

785
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,618
I was surprised!
I was surprised and...

786
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,553
It was really something.

787
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:06,023
Hearing "Young Forever"
ring across the stadium...

788
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:09,393
I was so happy
seeing everyone singing along.

789
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:15,532
I was really sad
but very thankful and happy.

790
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:20,170
The path we've been on
wasn't always smooth.

791
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,808
That song was released when we were
having a hard time.

792
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,178
I really wanted to see
that happen before my eyes.

793
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:33,517
"Will this last forever?"

794
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,488
"Will there be another day like this in my life?"
It made me think that.

795
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,658
I'm the eldest of the group.

796
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:44,561
So I tried to control
my feelings till the end.

797
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,330
And we still had to sing the last song.

798
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:58,676
The difficult times of not being
able to perform crossed my mind.

799
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:03,747
I was so sorry
and I had regrets.

800
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:09,453
But they still loved me
and comforted me.

801
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:16,927
Those things got mixed together
and made me cry so hard.

802
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,864


803
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,267
Thank you so much.
One, two, three!

804
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,401
Thank you.

805
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:44,521
<Saying goodbye
with a heart full of gratitude>

806
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,366
We truly love you.
Thank you so much.

807
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,267
We will come back!

808
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:01,538
Thank you and love you! <At Wembley the place
of their dreams, B TS had two successful shows>

809
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:02,940
That was cheating!

810
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,175
I thought we played the wrong track.

811
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,211
- Me too.
- I was like what's wrong?

812
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,747
It was so fun.
It really was fun.

813
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,149
I used to think that

814
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:15,619
I tend to think
too much in concerts.

815
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,587
You may not see it but,

816
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,225
I thought that stops me
from having fun on stage.

817
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,195
During the two days in Wembley,

818
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,597
I had so much fun.

819
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,632
I enjoyed it so much.

820
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,669
Of course I thought about
how I did this and that but,

821
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,405
more than anything,
I really had fun!

822
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,206
Really!

823
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,510
It troubled me that
I can't enjoy the show myself.

824
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,579
But it's just fun now
in Wembley.

825
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:47,618
I hope those who came tonight
felt that they "had fun".

826
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,621
I think that's the most important thing.

827
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,489
It was so fun.

828
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,697
I shouldn't cry any more.

829
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:05,736
I cried too many times.

830
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,574
And ARMY was worried.

831
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:14,711
I really tried hard
not to cry anymore.

832
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:24,855
Wow, it was so moving.

833
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,291
It is really hard
to plan a surprise event.

834
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:30,127
I know because I've been there.

835
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:35,232
It must have been so hard
for that many people to plan an event.

836
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:40,838
I want to say thank you
so much for doing that for us.

837
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:45,108
Seriously... It made me think
how lucky I am to be alive.

838
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,645
I was so happy.
Thank you!

839
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,983
Why do they keep making me cry?

840
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,885
I'm not a crybaby.

841
00:55:55,452 --> 00:56:00,157
There're many things
that ARMY and I just click.

842
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:04,394
That's why I cried.
It's not because I cry a lot.

843
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:10,367
It made me cry
only because it was ARMY.

844
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,502
I'm not a crybaby.

845
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,605
<Sad>

846
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,040
I had no idea about it.

847
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,209
ARMY you're so mean.

848
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,511
You made me cry...!

849
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,182
ARMY, you won!

850
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:35,859
Thank you so much for
coming to our show at Wembley.

851
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:39,263
In fact, the flight tickets
from Korea to the UK were sold out.

852
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,832
I heard it was
really hard to get the tickets.

853
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,067
Thank you so much for coming.

854
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,736
I hope to see you again.

855
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:46,970
Bye!

856
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:51,742
I had so much fun
that my entire body ached after the show.

857
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:56,580
I've received such good energy
thanks to you guys.

858
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,883
I hope we meet again.

859
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:04,054
I was so happy to meet so many ARMY.

860
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:09,393
It has become a beautiful memory
and I never want to forget it.

861
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:15,032
I want to have another show
in Wembley if I get a chance.

862
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,066
Bye!

863
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:22,739
I want to say thank you
for giving me this wonderful life.

864
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,976
I'll keep on working
and upgrade myself

865
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:30,013
and come back to London
and have another great show in Wembley.

866
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,582
I'll be looking forward to that day.

867
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,484
I love you!

868
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,888
Just the fact that
we got to do this tour

869
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:46,496
is an unforgettable thing and an honor,
and it made me very happy.

870
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:50,801
I could bring myself up once again
thanks to you guys.

871
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,769
I really wanted to tell you that.

872
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,804
Thank you!

873
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,671
I love you!

874
00:57:55,138 --> 00:58:00,110
We wouldn't have had the show
if it wasn't for you, seriously.

875
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,013
As B TS, we'll work hard

876
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:07,084
to bring you more joy

877
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:10,754
with good music
and good performance.

878
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,391
And let's all be healthy!
And happy!

879
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,226
The most important.

880
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,394
Fighting!

881
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,430
Wembley was a fun and happy show.

882
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,566
I think that's all I need.

883
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:26,069
I hope the happiness and joy I felt

884
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,239
get delivered to those
watching this DVD.

885
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,276
Please stay healthy, be happy
and make a lot of money.

886
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,378
I love you!
