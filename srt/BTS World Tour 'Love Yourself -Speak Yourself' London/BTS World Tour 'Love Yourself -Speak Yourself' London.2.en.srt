Everybody, jump!

Hey, guys!

18
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,690
Today,

19
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,794
we feel so nice, ARMY.

20
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,363
Did you go swimming?

21
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,932
Did you swim?

22
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,769
You are so lit!

23
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,508
That's right!

24
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:47,514
We're so happy to share
this moment with you, ARMY.

25
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,088
We prepared this song
for you because,

26
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,325
you are the light
to our night.

27
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,631
ARMY, please listen.
Let's go!

28
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:19,579
<Make It Right>

29
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,199
Namjoon, why are you there?

30
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,535
I like to run.

31
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,371
I love marathon.

32
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,474
How are you guys?

33
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,575

00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,321
This is a really unforgettable night.

37
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,997
To remember,
let's have a photo time.

38
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,867
Photo time, guys.

39
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,871
Oh, Wembley.

40
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,207
Photo time with ARMY!

41
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,844

44
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,917
All right!

45
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,185
Okay.

46
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,221
One, two, three!

47

ARMY!

54
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,044
Hey, ARMY!

55
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:28,087
Let's make an ARMY BOMB wave
here in Wembley.

56
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,456
I want it.

57
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,428
You want it?
I want it.

58
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,563
Want it!

59
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,037
Whoa, awesome!

60
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,806
Okay.

61
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,011
Hide your ARMY BOMB and
hold it up when the wave is coming, okay?

62
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,846
Okay.

63
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,915
J, where do we start from?

64
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,450
Starting from...

65
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,557
From front to the back.

66
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,692
ARMY, follow us.

67
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,928
Okay, let's get it!

68
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,863
Are you ready?

69
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,035
Three, two, one!

70
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,737
Let's go!

71
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,906
Come on, hold up!

72
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,440
- Hold it up!
- So fast!

73
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,152
Oh my gosh!

74
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,186
So pretty.

75
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,155
So beautiful.

76
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,189
Okay.

77
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,224
So lit.

78
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,427
They're so, so good.

79
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,764
Okay, so we're going to
do one more time.

80
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,935
We're going to make a circle.

81
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:54,073
From this side
and keep going like...

82
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,045
Okay.

83
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,913
- Okay.
- Got it?

84
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,214
We got it.

85
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,384
- Let's start.
- Ready?

86
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,455
ARMY, you ready?

87
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,091
Okay, let's go.

88
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,863
Three, two, one, go!

89
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,602
Amazing!

90
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:30,142
- It's coming!
- Go!

91
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,747
Come on, come on!

92
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,651
Bloody blimey!

93
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,488
Spot on!

94
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,223
Amazing!

95
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,359
Rainbow!

96
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,460
Beautiful!

97
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,398
Hey, ARMY! You're the best!
You made it!

98
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,836
Hey, guys!

99
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,140
Beautiful!

100
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:06,646
This moment and this feeling
will forever be in my heart.

101
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,384
Really, beautiful!

102
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:21,627
Hey, why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here. Go there.

103
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,729
Okay.

104
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,900
We're going to say
how we felt tonight.

105
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,671
We're going to start from J.

106
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,907
- J!
- That's me.

107
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,512
Okay, UK!

108
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,616
:UK!
J!

109
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,717
Okay.

110
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,454
I'm so happy today.

111
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,629
I hope tonight
means a lot to you.

112
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,970
I can focus on you

113
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,611
especially through
"Mikrokosmos" stage

114
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,087
close and far.

115
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,358
It's hard to say in words but,

116
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,761
you are so lovely.

117
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,200
So thankful,

118
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:41,707
I may burst into tears.

119
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:53,953
I feel blessed because...

120
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,992
I don't cry.

121
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,796
Okay.

122
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,564
ARMY,

123
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:13,038
because not everyone can have

124
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,909
this cherished feelings

125
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:24,950
so you totally changed
my whole world.

126
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,059
Thank you so much.
I love you all.

127
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,047
Are you having fun tonight, ARMY?

128
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:03,022
ARMY, I'm already touched by you.

129
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:11,664
I can't follow all the songs
of my favorite singers,

130
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,034
but you made it, ARMY!

131
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:24,577
I will follow your footsteps.
I love you, ARMY!

132
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,649
I love you, ARMY.

133
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,855
Thank you.

134
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,763
Wow, Wembley!

135
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,001
Make some noise!

136
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,512
Okay.

137
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:05,951
We had a fun show tonight.

138
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,388
Thank you.

139
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,261
What I felt today doing the concert

140
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:19,531
was that your age,
where you're from,

141
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:24,236
none of that matters here at all.

142
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,743
Isn't that the power
of culture and music?

143
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,648
And we need you for that power.

144
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,152
Thank you for having fun with us.

145
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,924
Thank you for bringing
the power together.

146
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,662
Thank you, London!
Thank you, Wembley!

147
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,030
Thank you so much!

148
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,799
Make some noise!

149
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,589
Hey, guys!

150
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,831
London, you're very special to me.

151
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,103
So I feel like

152
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,373
I'm in the Milky Way.

153
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:40,379
This feeling, view, ARMY,
my heart is full.

154
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,321
I wish this moment will never end.

155
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:57,096
This is the last show in London.

156
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,737
I will sing in my dream with you, ARMY.

157
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,506
I promise.

158
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,643
See you there,
in my dream.

159
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,683
We purple you.

160
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,340
Wembley!

161
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,578
Did you have fun today?

162
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,351
I am happy.

163
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:59,358
I have been really
happy for two days.

164
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,562
They were like huge gifts for me.

165
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,635
So I would like to be a better man

166
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:13,472
to give you a lot of gifts.

167
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,480
I will never stop.
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

168
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,018
I will be a better man.

169
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:36,195
And I love you
from the bottom of my heart.

170
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,600
I love you so much.

171
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,073
I'll never forget today.
Thank you and I love you!

172
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,889
Okay.

173
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,660
Wembley!

174
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:17,169
I still can't believe that
we had two shows

175
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:20,172
in Wembley full of ARMY.

176
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:27,479
I was just a little Korean boy.

177
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,285
But now I became

178
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:37,689
someone's love,
someone's pride

179
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:43,795
beyond races, countries
and languages.

180
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,268
It's not easy at all.

181
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,539
So it's amazing
and unbelievable.

182
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,011
Anyway,

183
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:03,448
what I was trying to say is

184
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,153
you are the answer, ARMY.

185
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,161
The answer of all my life.

186
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,968
Thank you for enjoying this show.

187
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:28,006
I really, really love you.
And thank you.

188
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,613
Thank you, Wembley London!

189
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,553
ARMY!

190
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,566
Um...

191
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,804
I'm totally knackered.

192
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:05,077
Sorry, I just wanted to use
all the British expressions I know.

193
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:18,624
These two nights were
just more than dreams.

194
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,859
Actually, it was better than dreams.

195
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:35,140
These two nights would and could
mean so many things

196
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,479
historically, musically, businessly.

197
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:45,817
But more important than that,
I just want to say

198
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,053
that we had so much fun.

199
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,961
We had fun, right?

200
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,302
You know, we surely speak
the same language.

201
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,071
I don't mean English.
I don't mean Korean.

202
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:11,510
Eye to eye, looking at each other,
dancing and vibing together,

203
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,979
that's all we know.

204
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:25,724
I don't know if we could come here
in this big stadium again but,

205
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:31,430
let's have even more fun next year, okay?
Let's have more fun!

206
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:41,440
I just hope these two night were
worth all the waits and all the coming.

207
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,908
Thank you so much.

208
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,376
I love you, for real.

209
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,410
I love you.

210
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,246
Each one of you
have your own light and story.

211
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,883
We can see countless lights
in front of us.

212
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:56,121
ARMY, please hold lights on us
with your mobile phones,

213
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,923
not the ARMY BOMBs.

214
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,492
This is the phone time!

215
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,661
Oh my gosh!

216
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,796
Put your lights up in the sky.

217
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,600
This is the very last song for tonight.

218
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:14,506
And you are the stars of the night
and the light house that leads us.

219
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,741
Thank you so much.

220
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:16,975
Let's go.

221
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,417
And I'm knackered.

222
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,143
This is cheating.

223
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,196
- I had no clue.
- I'm surprised.

224
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:30,976
You can't do this.
This was not on the set list.

225
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,211
I'm touched.

226
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,584
I will never forget this.

227
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,393
We're going to stay young forever, right?

228
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,334
Let's stay young forever together!

229
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,095
We need to say something.

230
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,231
I was surprised.

231
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,666
I was really surprised.

232
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,237
I thought we played the wrong track.

233
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,140
"Young Forever" is really...

234
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,343
It brings me emotions
whenever I hear it.

235
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,218
I wasn't going to cry today.

236
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:57,996
This is why I can't stop loving you.

237
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,500
Guys...

238
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,140
This song...

239
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:16,414
Had brought me a great comfort.

240
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:42,307
Thank you so much
for singing with us

241
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,910
and having fun with us.
I'm happy and I love you.

242
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:59,457
Thank you so much
for making me feel

243
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,193
how happy it is to be alive.

244
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,040
Really, we love London.

245
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,746
We will come back next year.

246
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,419
Cross my heart.
I promise.

247
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:36,227
Thank you for
doing this for us.

248
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,030
We'll never forget this.

249
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,575
Here goes the very last song
for tonight.

250
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,311
Thank you.

251
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:04,289
<i><Mikrokosmos></i>

252
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,200
- We love you!
- One more time!

253
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,738
ARMY, I love you!

254
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,342
London, I love you!

255
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,712
Thank you, guys.

256
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,053
Thank you!

257
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,071
Come on guys, let's smile.
It's a good day.

258
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:27,485
This moment, this night,

259
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:33,057
it will make us stay young forever.
Thank you so much.

260
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,726
One, two, three!

261
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:35,827
Thank you.

One, two, three!

Thank you.

264
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,047
Thank you, London.

265
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,350
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

266
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,152
Thank you, ARMY.

00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,323
Good night, guys.

Second floor, third floor, thank you so much.
See you guys, thank you.

286
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,851
Bye, guys!

287
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,794
Come on.

288
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:58,596
Come over here.

289
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:06,671
London, please make some great noise
for our beautiful dancers.

290
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,005
Make some noise!

291
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,647
Thank you, guys.
One, two, three.

292
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,249
