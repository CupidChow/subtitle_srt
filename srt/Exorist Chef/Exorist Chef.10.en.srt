1
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,680
This is...

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,400
The wedding hall.

3
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,520
To be precise,

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,120
Soon.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,760
Who are you?

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh no.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
It's fine to be the wife of the fortress,

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,720
but this thing

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,800
is too ugly.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,440
Don't touch her.

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,680
Le Xibai.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Master, are you okay?

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
Le Xibai.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,400
Master.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Master!

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
Let go of my master!

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,800
She's so weak.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,680
Who are you to protect her?

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,120
Useless!

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,160
Monster!

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,039
Let her go!

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
If she wants to suppress us,

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,880
it's also my fortress.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,600
Stop!

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,120
Le Xibai.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
What are you doing?

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,440
Do you know I'm a demon hunter?

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Isn't it more impressive

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,479
Isn't that more impressive?

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Hey.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Wait!

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
Brother Monster!

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Actually,

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,240
I already have someone I like.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
That boy just now.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,360
Even if I'm with you,

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
my heart will still be with him.

38
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,680
And we signed a contract.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Once we part, we can't live.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Why?

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,000
Let me ask you.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
what gifts do the bride like?

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,160
I can let you go.

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,040
make a deal with me.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,120
Le Xibai.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
There's only half of the blood.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,520
Why is it so serious?

48
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,880
It should be

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
won't cause such serious damage.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,440
Could it be...

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,160
Like he said,

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,560
The reason he left the boy

53
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,520
Someone wanted to kill him.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,320
Who is it?

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,520
Do your job.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Whether he can live or not

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,160
depends on you.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,240
Le Xibai.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,280
Wake up.

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,280
Master.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,560
Are you okay?

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll kill him.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait.

64
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
He was harmless.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,240
In this way,

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
you can't subdue him.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
What do you mean?

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
He was the son of the county magistrate down the mountain.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
With his childhood friend by the side,

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
We are childhood friends.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Father.

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

73
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,520
But I was so sick.

74
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,120
Yun.

75
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,040
Flowers.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,120
Thank you for being with me

77
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,920
at the most beautiful moment.

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,400
with me

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
into

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Evil.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,200
will convert

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
to

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,640
Beloved?

84
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,840
From now on,

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
he was despised by the world.

86
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,200
and even his family turned him down.

87
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,480
Does he regret it?

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Maybe...

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,720
[she didn't]

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
She lost her memory.

91
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,600
and completely forgot me.

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,560
I dreamed many times

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
I just want her to remember me.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,840
But you have demon aura.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,560
Do you know it will hurt her?

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,720
Yes.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,480
That's why I kept thinking

98
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,680
if I killed the groom,

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
the bride will be heartbroken

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
and be criticized.

101
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,320
I know that too.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
Why don't you help her?

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,640
She's getting married tomorrow.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
So,

105
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
this wedding hall

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
is the place

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,600
is about to get married.

108
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
It's an auspicious day.

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,760
I want to give her the last gift.

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
You are...

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,960
You want me to find the answer to your gift.

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,880
You can do it.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,640
Of course.

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,320
Leave it to me.

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,320
After all,

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
only women know women best.

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,000
So,

118
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,280
we need to help him.

119
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,560
How?

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Give me the gift.

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,920
Congratulations.

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,760
Please come in.

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
Where is this

124
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,960
Where is this

125
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,520
The bride is waiting for makeup.

126
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,440
Come on.

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Follow us.

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Hey.

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,640
Let's go.

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,600
What are you doing?

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Come on.

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
Makeup lady.

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Not bad.

134
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,480
It's love with bread.

135
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,920
That's a relief.

136
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,760
Madam.

137
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,840
Thank you.

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
Please.

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
Why is there a sound of the stove?

140
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Is he a cook?

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Don't talk nonsense.

142
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
God!

143
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,720
Help me!

144
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
With my makeup skills,

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Got it.

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,360
Well...

147
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
Wait outside.

148
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
Yes.

149
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
The material of the makeup lady

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,440
is so special.

151
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,000
This is...

152
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,600
This...

153
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
What is this?

154
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,360
This is...

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,640
foundation.

156
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh.

157
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,480
You're indeed the best makeup lady in all towns.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
It's something I've never heard of.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,640
So gentle and lovely.

160
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,320
That monster

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,320
was once a match for her.

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,280
This...

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,520
It's so heavy.

164
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
Is it thick?

165
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
No.

166
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,720
This

167
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Liu Dao Mei.

168
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Absolutely.

169
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
to overwhelm

170
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,360
the same

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,680
Liuye eyebrows.

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,080
Liuye.

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,760
I love willow.

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,559
Ryu is my favorite.

175
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,720
But this is too...

176
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,559
It's not important.

177
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
You should know your heart.
