1
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,480
This guy

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,160
a nanny.

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
or my exclusive nanny.

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,520
Oh.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,160
I remember.

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Back then...

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,520
Little persimmon.

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
I thought about it for a long time.

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,840
Let's break up.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you for

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
for saving up my experience

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,440
and become a perfect boyfriend.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
When I finally meet her,

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,640
I can seize the chance

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
and give her the best companionship and protection.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
You're a university of love

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,160
for free.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,800
But I didn't write anything about holding hands, hugging and kissing.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,080
Alas.

20
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,240
A demon stayed up all night.

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
It's only 5%.

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,480
Come on.

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Thank you.

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,800
Consider it a farewell to our leader.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,840
One month is not enough.

26
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,640
Not enough.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll cook two more dishes for you.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,960
No need.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,200
Uh.

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
That's enough.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
Without setting,

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
a new persona appears.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,079
She loves pretending to be nice.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,480
Miss.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,240
Why are you so mysterious?

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,560
You're the mysterious one.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,280
Why are you wearing a mask?

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm trying to save my life.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
I don't remember what happened before.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,640
I only remember

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,560
all the demons in the world were after me.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,400
Until one day,

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,360
I was taught by a master.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
The lights are near.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
Follow the light.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,520
is the way home.

47
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,240
After wearing the mask,

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,240
after wearing the mask.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
But there are still dangers everywhere.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
You may die anytime.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,160
You walking energy tank.

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
It'd be strange if a demon could let you go.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
Although my mask is broken,

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,880
but luckily I met you.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
A priest told me

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,680
as long as I follow you,

57
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,640
I can find my way home.

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,840
Go!

59
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,000
Take this!

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,960
Something's coming out!

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,120
You're such a demon hunter.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,440
Stay away from me.

63
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,280
I didn't see what you wrote in the notebook,

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
but my portrait was on it.

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,000
You...

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
like me?

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Let go.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,880
Miss, look.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,720
If you leave alone,

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,480
with no power.

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,280
Why don't we have a company?

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,240
I'll be your bodyguard for free.

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,040
Master.

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,480
Miss.

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,000
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

76
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,240
That man is strong.

77
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll leave it to you.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,079
Miss.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,800
My bag.

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,840
I'll take this.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,640
Wait for me, miss.

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,400
There's demon aura.

83
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,320
Miss.

84
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,360
Why are you running so fast?

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,920
You again?

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,800
You ran so fast.

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Did you find anything?

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Why are you following me?

89
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,600
Look.

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,200
The road ahead is dangerous.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,720
You just need my diagram.

92
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
I miss her.

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
The skill you taught me

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,200
in exchange,

95
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
I can protect you.

96
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
What skill?

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,040
That set of

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,960
to fight demons.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
Food technique?

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,200
You wish.

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
This boy looks delicious.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Will you teach me?

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
The short-lived mandarin ducks.

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,320
Miss.

105
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
Keep an eye on him.

106
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
Huh?

107
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,440
Is that contract

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
really work on me?

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Miss,

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
It does work.

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,800
You almost lost me.

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Huh?

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
It's okay.

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,360
You don't believe me?

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,280
I'll try again.

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,960
Miss.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,880
My hands and legs are getting weaker.

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,840
Oh no no no

119
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm exhausted.

120
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Why don't you go first?

121
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
I'll catch up with you later.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,760
Okay.

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,960
Hurry up.

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
Why are you back?

125
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,120
Isn't it important to hurry?

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
It doesn't matter.

127
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,840
What matters is who you're with.

128
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Hey!

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,960
What are you doing?

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
Put me down!

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,040
Didn't your mom tell you not to hug other girls?

132
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,240
I'll carry you if you're tired.

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,440
Help!

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,640
If I had held her like this back then,

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
the bitterness of love.

136
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,560
Yuanhan.

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
It's time.

138
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,000
This face makes me angry.

139
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,600
You...

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,720
Come here.

141
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Let me talk to you.

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Little NPC.

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm not Little Fox.

144
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,080
My name is Le Xi Bai.

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,640
Le Xi Bai.

146
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
I didn't even come up with a name.

147
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
but I gave myself a name.

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Are you willing to teach me?

149
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Master,

150
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
please accept my bow.

151
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
Hey.

152
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,600
Don't play this trick on me.

153
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Master.

154
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,200
along the way,

155
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,280
along the way.

156
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,640
It's better for us to walk alone.

157
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,800
Besides,

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,840
I know

159
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,440
you want to take me as your disciple.

160
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
Which eye did you see that?

161
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,159
You have many chances to get rid of me along the way.

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
But you didn't.

163
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,400
So,

164
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,720
not only is my master kind,

165
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
he acknowledges me.

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
Am I right?

167
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,880
Yeah.

168
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
If he was eaten by a demon,

169
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,320
the contract will automatically be terminated.

170
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll teach you.

171
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,160
Sure.

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
But you have to cooperate with me first.

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,960
Okay.

174
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
How can I cooperate with you?

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,480
Intelligence.

176
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,600
It's safer there.

177
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,800
Stand over there.

178
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Watch me.

179
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
So easily fooled.

180
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Take off your blindfold.

181
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,920
Wouldn't it be faster for the demons to find you?

182
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,120
Wait.

183
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,159
Take off your stupid eyeshades.

184
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,159
or you can't see clearly.

185
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Go.

186
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Fresh human.

187
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,800
Please enjoy.

188
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,640
Master.
