1
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,680
Help!

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Somebody help me

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
This model face.

4
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,039
I wrote it.

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,360
Hey.

6
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Oh.

7
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,039
I'm Mei Nanzi.

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,640
Thank you for saving me.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,960
My name is Egg.

10
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,520
When did you call yourself my daughter?

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
May I ask who you are?

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,800
Oh.

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,840
Le Xibai.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,240
May I ask

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
What's your relationship?

16
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,360
She is my master.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,640
I'm her disciple.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,080
Oh.

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
I see.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,720
Ah.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,600
Miss.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Are you hungry?

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,840
No.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
None of your business.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,200
Uh...

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,720
Shall we go for supper?

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,120
I'll leave you two alone.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,800
Hey.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,960
It's nothing.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's go together.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
Let him cook.

32
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,200
I didn't expect

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,160
being your disciple is so happy.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,320
I can cook for a fairy-like sister.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,920
Let's go.

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,000
Mei Nanzi Mei Nanzi

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,600
How about

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,520
let me cook for you

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,600
to repay you for saving my life.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,480
Wow.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Wow

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,600
persimmons.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,320
Hush.

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,680
Talk later.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Wow

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,560
So many

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
It's custom-made for your taste buds.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Try it.

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,280
It's delicious.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,280
Really?

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
That's a high evaluation.

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,560
Let me try.

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,360
How can someone be so handsome?

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,880
and diligent?

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
You're still a god when you cook?

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
I love cooking.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,120
If

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
I can cook for my family,

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,840
That's good.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Sorry.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,200
It's okay.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm used to wandering alone.

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Don't touch me.

65
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,920
With all due respect,

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,120
Mr. Bai,

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,320
You are master and disciple with Ms. persimmon.

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
You're too nosy.

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,200
You...

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
When I see you being kind,

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,800
a little

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,160
too enthusiastic.

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
It's okay.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
You're alone.

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,400
Although we are companions,

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
we've been wandering around.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
and had no place to live.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
You...

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
It's okay.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
I don't mind following you.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Stop.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,600
You don't mind?

84
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,320
I do.

85
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,760
No problem.

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,519
Let's do it together.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Be generous.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
He has no place to live.

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
What's wrong with that?

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
You're in a row too.

91
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,040
Three rows are happier.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
What about me?

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,960
It's windy at night.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
Let's go back to our room and rest.

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,159
I'm not eating.

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,320
You don't even care about your mission.

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't believe you won't come back.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Ten seconds.

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Nine.

101
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
Wait for me.

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,960
Le Xibai is such a fool.

103
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,160
Let's see how long you can endure.

104
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
Thank you again for saving me.

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,000
You're welcome.

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
I saw that you're not in a good mood.

107
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
there seems to be

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,360
between you and Mr. Bai.

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Of course.

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,840
a useless disciple.

111
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
As his master,

112
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,800
I really want to be invincible.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Miss persimmon,

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
I studied medicine for a few years.

115
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,480
Yesterday, I saw that Mr. Bai looked pale.

116
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
and his yang energy was fluctuating.

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,960
I'm afraid...

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,480
Now His Majesty has hired a magical weapon to suppress demons.

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,880
it will hurt

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,280
will also be hurt.

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,040
If Young Master Xiao Bai enters the Imperial City,

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm afraid he can't get in.

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,040
I won't be able to get out.

124
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,000
So serious?

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
Miss is busy.

126
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
It's inconvenient to bring Young Master Xiao Bai along.

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,280
How about...

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
let Mr. Bai

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
for a while.

130
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
The tea you like

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
is the same as me.

132
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,120
You even have the same habit

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
Me too.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
persimmons never read.

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,600
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
This is called the Book Realm.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,159
A book is better than a book.

138
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,760
Miss.

139
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,240
It's so interesting.

140
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,120
Tell me then.

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
What do you mean?

142
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
You're mocking a girl.

143
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,200
she's willing to stay with you.

144
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
I think

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,159
there's something special about you.

146
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm so jealous.

147
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Le Xibai.

148
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,280
Don't be too fierce to her.

149
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,840
I'm talking to you nicely.

150
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
I heard everything.

151
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,920
You must be hungry.

152
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll make you something to eat.

153
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,520
I...

154
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,560
I'm hungry too.

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,080
What are you doing?

156
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,200
I didn't mean it.

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,080
What?

158
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Le Xibai.

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,320
What are you doing?

160
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
Why are you still making trouble here?

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
This man is up to no good.

162
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm afraid he's not a demon.

163
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,080
Mr. Bai.

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,560
Your spoon

165
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,000
is quite suitable to be a mirror.

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Le Xi Bai, get out.

167
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
I'll help.

168
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,880
Get out.

169
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,680
Get out!

170
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
He's not a demon?

171
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,240
Miss persimmon.

172
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,120
Let me carry it for you.

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,920
Thank you.

174
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,960
Hey.

175
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,880
What?

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
Help me carry it.

177
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
You're so strong.

178
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,600
You just eat and don't work.

179
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,240
You're being nice.

180
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Just carry it yourself.

181
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,000
Gosh.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
Oh my

183
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,720
Ah.

184
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,400
Are you okay?

185
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
My luggage is too heavy.

187
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
I want to help you.

188
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,880
I didn't expect that...

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
Mr. Bai...

190
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
hit me.

191
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,840
It's all my fault.

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,760
What are you talking about?

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Who hit you?

194
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,200
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,080
I said something wrong.
