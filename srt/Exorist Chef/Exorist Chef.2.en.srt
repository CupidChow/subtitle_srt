1
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Are you okay?

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,320
Miss.

3
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Who dares to take advantage of me?

4
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,200
Miss.

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,600
I saved you just now.

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
What was that light?

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,440
What is this feeling?

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,760
But do you think

10
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,320
feel excited?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,480
Hey.

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,200
My temper.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Centipede demon.

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,720
Wow!

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,640
How did I become stronger?

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
You're really

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,080
You're good.

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,160
What are you doing?

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't touch me.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
I saved you just now.

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,240
You don't have to dislike me.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Who are you?

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,360
Stop pretending to be a hero.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't remember writing this kind of NPC. I'm not a player.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
You're mistaken.

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,039
I'm just a kind person.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,840
By the way,

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,600
Are you okay?

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,560
Stay away from me.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,480
I'll be fine.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,280
Well...

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,360
Where's the centipede demon?

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,680
Come out.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,880
Zhang Wei.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
It's you, you bastard!

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,720
Don't drop anything.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,840
Oh.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
Coffee takes so long.

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,920
You're such a sneaky man.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,320
Why are you blocking me?

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
I can still recognize you even if I turn into ashes.

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,520
Are you okay?

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,079
You hit my wound.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,960
Miss.

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,760
I know where the centipede's flaw is.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Can you

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
help me up?

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,880
Let me help you.

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,079
I'm speechless.

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Huh?

52
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
I think I got milk again.

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,920
Hey.

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,360
Wait.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm so worried.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Miss.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,640
Do you know me?

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,040
No.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,120
I recognize the ashes.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,880
Oh.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
Looks like you still have a grudge.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,320
Cut the crap.

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,080
Tell me.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Where is the opening?

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,720
Look carefully.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
Who got hurt?

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Who didn't get hurt?

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
The centipede didn't attack her.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
Did her closest friend change it?

70
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Chicken skin.

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,560
Okay.

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,400
Hide!

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
Fire is to the God of Kitchen.

74
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,200
All flavors, listen.

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,640
Meal: Golden Crispy Chicken Skin.

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Chicken skin.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,320
It smells good.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,760
Read seeds

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,200
It explodes at the beginning.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm so lucky.

81
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
The first warning of love.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
Never be rigid.

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,279
Don't use labels to identify people.

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Master.

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
Why do you have the Encyclopedia of Demon Slaying?

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
You mean this?

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,360
A master gave it to me.

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
I don't know what it is.

89
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,680
Could it be...

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
this is a combination of two swords?

91
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,120
Suzhen.

92
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,880
Honey.

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
Leader.

94
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Leader.

95
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Leader. Honey.

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Wait for my victory.

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
and have a daughter.

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Honey.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Wait for me.

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll be back soon.

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
Wait for me.

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Honey.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
I’ll be back soon.

104
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
Ever since Leader left,

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,200
he’s been crying all day.

106
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,040
Really

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,560
Show us.

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,160
It's been half a year.

109
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,600
Why are you crying?

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,480
Just pretend to be pitiful.

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,080
I'll always be with you.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,760
Suzhen.

113
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
You've suffered.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,440
I broke my promise.

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,480
I hate you.

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
I hate myself for being unable to do anything.

118
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
Madam is a jinx.

119
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
She killed Leader.

120
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
What a bad luck.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,920
Jinx.

122
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,160
You bastards!

123
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,480
treat your master’s wife like this.

124
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,720
So this is the story of our leader.

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
Maybe

126
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,080
I can only return to the real world after I subdue all demons.

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
The leader became a centipede

128
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,800
to see his wife for the last time.

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Who would have thought

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
he saw his wife being bullied.

131
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,240
In fact, he has been swallowed by the demon aura

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
and lost his nature.

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,800
In the end,

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,400
he just wants to protect the one he loves quietly.

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Seed.

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
Seed

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
It means

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
missing his wife.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,560
Sigh.

140
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
So touching.

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,680
Thank you.

142
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,760
Monster Slayer.

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
You've waited for him?

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
He said

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,560
the little girl you want

146
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
can only be fulfilled in the next life.

147
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Actually,

148
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
when you made fried chicken skin,

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
Before he went on the expedition,

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,200
he liked fried chicken skin the most.

151
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,640
The demons have been taken away.

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,800
After that,

153
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,560
we'll never see each other again.

154
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
What?

155
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,360
I don't remember these scenes.

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,280
My colleague added them.

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
Who is this guy

158
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
Who is he?

159
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040
Miss.

160
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,320
Where are you going?

161
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,400
Don't follow me.

162
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,600
Don't pretend to know me just because you look like him.

163
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,800
Uh.

164
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,400
Player Energy Can.

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,760
It's used for players' energy supply.

166
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,640
But it needs a specific way.

167
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,880
It turns out to be a cannon fodder NPC.

168
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
In the contract,

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,120
Chef PY023.

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
What contract?

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,240
Player chef PY023.

172
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Her life value is perfect.

173
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
Full energy value.

174
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Add a contract now.

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,480
The two parties have reached a demand relationship.

176
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,679
and the ox's life is connected.

177
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
No more than half a mile away.

178
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
Contract Sign Activation.

179
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
intimate physical contact.

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
Not only holding hands,

181
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Hug.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Kiss.

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
This guy

184
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
a nanny.

185
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,120
or my exclusive nanny.
