3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,720
Xinyue!

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,710
Where are you going?

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,870
I'm here to save you.

6
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,440
Don't be afraid.

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
Ling Hao.

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,630
Where is Ling Hao?

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Ling Hao?

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,550
After he brought you back that day,

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,990
he went to Young Master Su's house.

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,630
But he was not
with Young Master Su.

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
I found it a bit strange.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,710
Could it be that he was scolded
by Young Master Su?

15
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,720
Xinyue.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,870
Xinyue, wait for me.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,150
Ling Hao, open the door.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,310
Young Master is not here.

19
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,990
Come back another day.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,670
Ling Hao, it's Du Xinyue.

21
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,550
Ling Hao, sober up.

22
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,910
Young Lady.

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,230
You're the one who's not sober.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
You...

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,870
I know.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,710
I know you are very sad.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,310
So am I.

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
But

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,470
you have to accept reality.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,630
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,190
I only know that Young Master is gone!

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,070
I don't know.

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,150
And I don't care.

34
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Fine.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,190
If that's the case,

36
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,750
I'll go find him myself.

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,750
You stay here and face the reality.

38
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,140
(Xingyue Tavern)

39
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,470
Have you heard?

40
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,950
Someone saved a person
who was injured in an explosion.

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,390
I heard his injury was really terrible.

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,110
We're eating.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,390
Can we not talk about this?

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
Xinyue, where are you going?

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,510
Where is this person you mentioned?

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,990
Not sure.

47
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,670
- Is the injured person here?
- Yes.

48
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,150
He is seriously injured.

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,980
His ears were blown deaf.

50
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,150
His arm was severed.

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,390
It's really tragic.

52
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,310
Su Xingluo, is that you?

53
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,390
Thank you.

54
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,030
Young Lady.

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,940
Master requests your presence.

56
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,220
(Xingyue Tavern)

57
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,830
That day, I grabbed you and ran out.

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,870
Then we saw the explosion.

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,630
I still believe he didn't die.

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
I hope so.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,870
This is

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,830
left by your mother, right?

63
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,830
Young Master said

64
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,030
you've been wearing it
since she passed away.

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,950
I never mentioned this to him.

66
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,510
How could he know?

67
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
He

68
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,990
has known you since childhood.

69
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
What?

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,350
Don't worry, I will definitely
burn all these bad things.

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,230
That boy

72
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,110
was actually him?

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,390
Young Master always said
it was you who gave him courage

74
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,910
to face this world bravely.

75
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,110
He became Red Fox,

76
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,510
and fought to destroy opium,

77
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,910
all for that promise from back then?

78
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,230
It was not only for you,

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,070
but also for himself,

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,190
and for those children

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,750
who lost their parents because of opium.

82
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,390
But why did he never mention it?

83
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,870
He originally wanted
to tell you these words in person,

84
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,430
but I was afraid he
wouldn't get the chance.

85
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm jinxing it.

86
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,510
Xingluo went too much.

87
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,790
He didn't even say goodbye before leaving

88
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,150
for another province.

89
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,950
I think

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,150
he just went out for fun.

91
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,550
You should have gone with him.

92
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,720
Don't blame him.

93
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,390
It's just that I had things to do
at the tavern,

94
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,230
so I didn't go with him.

95
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
It's okay.

96
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,350
When he comes back,

97
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,110
I'll take care of it for you.

98
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm back now, aren't I?

99
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Father.

100
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,030
Did you miss me?

101
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,670
You still know how to come home?

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,350
Leaving your wife alone at home,

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,270
what kind of husband does that?

104
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
Apologize to her now.

105
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
It's okay.

106
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,150
I'm just glad he's back.

107
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,430
Young Master!

108
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,710
What are you doing?

109
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,190
- Come down.
- I'm not dead.

110
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,040
Stop making a fuss.

111
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
What are you doing?

112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,390
Marshal Guo.

113
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,270
I'll leave you to it.

114
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,240
I have some matters to attend to
at the Chamber of Commerce.

115
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
Okay.

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
I'll leave you to it.

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
What's wrong?

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,150
This time you're not asking
if I'm a human or a ghost?

119
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,590
Actually, I went to the tavern
to find you as soon as I got back.

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,910
Yao said you weren't there,
so I hurried home.

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,430
I could have been back earlier,

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,360
but...

123
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,070
