3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,550
Was it really the Red Fox?

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,390
Of course.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,190
The three of us
weren't just sitting around.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,990
After Red Fox injured us,
he set the warehouse on fire.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,950
Look at my injury.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,430
Luckily, I wasn't there.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,190
Stop talking nonsense.
You owe us a meal.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,990
Hurry up and go.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,950
Xinyue.

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,360
Xinyue?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,150
Are you alright?

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,510
I'm fine.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,790
Are you sure it was Red Fox
who killed the person that night?

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,150
Absolutely, Young Master.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,590
Zhang and the others told me personally.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,790
Then why didn't the report
just say it outright?

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,990
That's beyond the knowledge
of people like us.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,230
This is all the information I have.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,350
Is there anything else you need?

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,190
Xinyue.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,510
Do you have any other questions?

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,030
No.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,510
Young Master Chen Xi,

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,070
I said this at your request.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,390
If there are any repercussions,

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,830
please speak for me.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,110
I know.

30
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,030
You may leave now.

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,110
I'll come to you if I need anything.

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,750
Alright, I'll take my leave.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,710
I'll take my leave.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,310
I was also shocked when I heard it.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,590
I didn't expect it to be Red Fox.

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,430
If I had known
I would encounter him that day,

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,750
I would have risked my life
to catch him.

38
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,390
Whether you could catch him or not
is another matter.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,870
Do you think
what you're saying makes sense?

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,750
Why would Red Fox kill Xinyue's father?

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,830
That's what the person
on duty that night said.

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,230
Moreover,

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,870
everyone knows Red Fox is ruthless.

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,510
Isn't it normal for him to kill someone?

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,270
Are you making conclusions
based on hearsay?

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,750
What reason would he have to lie?

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,590
Enough!

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,390
Chen Xi,

49
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,470
thank you for the information.

50
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,350
I'll see you off.

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,950
No need.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,470
Xinyue.

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,110
Wait.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
Do you really believe what Chen said?

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,950
He randomly found someone to frame me.

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,830
He doesn't even know you are Red Fox.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,750
How could he frame you?

58
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,390
I have never killed anyone.

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,430
How could I possibly kill your father?

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,270
But that was five years ago.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,910
You...

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,310
You'd better think it through.

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,310
Do you

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,790
now

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,870
suspect me?

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,310
I just want to confirm something.

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,550
Could it be that you have forgotten?

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,470
Could it be that you...

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,270
Stop talking.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,310
I understand.

Why did you get so wet?

76
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,430
Yao.

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,310
Yao.

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,790

Xinyue, Red Fox
has a mysterious identity,

93
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,910
and exceptional skills.

94
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,190
How can we avenge Father?

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,910
Do you think this was done by Red Fox?

96
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,870
Who else could it be?

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,110
You look through these files every day,

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,630
and don't run the tavern.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,750
What are you thinking?

100
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,710
I'm thinking about
why he would kill my father.

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,670
He had no reason to do so.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,150
But why would he?

103
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,550
Young Master,

104
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,030
(Red Fox Raid, Two Places Caught Fire)
I found the newspaper from five years ago.

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,880
There were two places
that caught fire that night.

106
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,270
We went to this building.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,990
Someone even took out a gun.

108
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,230
Do you remember?

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,470
So?

110
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,550
So it proves that
Young Lady wronged you.

111
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,870
How could you appear

112
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,950
in two places at the same time?

113
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,150
It's useless.

114
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,030
She doesn't believe me at all now.

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,990
Even if I take these things to her,

116
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,430
she will just think I'm making excuses.

117
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,270
But we can't just let it go like this.

118
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,830
Don't lose heart.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,550
Although Red Fox is elusive,

120
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
I will do my best to help you catch him.

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,510
I still find it a bit strange.

122
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,510
Strange in what way?

123
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,350
Red Fox doesn't seem the type
to kill indiscriminately.

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,750
He had no reason.

125
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,590
Why would he kill Father?

126
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,230
Maybe his intention wasn't to harm him.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,070
Or perhaps,

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,430
your father got involved by accident.

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,430
Look at what this newspaper says.

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,990
There was also a fire
in the west of the city that night.

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,830
And someone saw Red Fox around there.

132
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,150
If that's the case,

133
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,670
how could Red Fox be
in two places at the same time?

134
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,870
But it might not be at the same time.

135
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,390
Look at today's newspaper.

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,790
Last night, Red Fox set fire
to three places in a row.

137
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,590
In any case,

138
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,510
this matter must be related to Red Fox.

139
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,990
As long as we catch him,

140
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,790
the truth will come to light.

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,030
Young Master Chen, why are you here?

142
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,110
Father asked me to retrieve some files.

143
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,150
You can leave now.

144
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,030
Alright.
