3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Go ahead.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,590
- See you.
- Okay.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,440
Yes.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,550
So sweet.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,950
Caiyan.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,350
How did you get back?

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,230
I wanted to surprise you.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,030
Why have you lost weight?

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, what can I say?

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,130
- Let's go.
- Go.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,430
This Tan guy really went too far.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,190
I'll take people to kill him right now.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,470
Wait, Caiyan.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,440
No need.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,310
You want to just let him go?

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,030
But Caiyan,

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,470
why did you suddenly come back?

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,790
Is Chen Xi back too?

21
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,070
Yes.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,630
He insisted on coming back with me.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Enough about me.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,270
How's your newlywed life?

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,990
Does Young Master Su treat you well?

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
Has he bullied you?

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,310
If he dares to bully you,

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,070
I'll teach him a lesson.

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Oh, by the way,

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,390
there's a banquet tonight.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,870
Why don't you take him with you?

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,870
I won't go.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,830
I have to watch the shop tonight.

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,870
Xinyue.

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
Xingluo.

36
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,650
Ah?

37
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,950
What are you daydreaming about?

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,230
Marshal is organizing a banquet tonight.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,750
All the notable people in Luocheng
will attend.

40
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,590
You have to go too.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm not going.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,510
What's so interesting
about their banquet?

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,910
You brat.

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,230
Marshal thought you were dead back then

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,350
and sent people
to our house to mourn you.

46
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,990
I get angry just thinking about it.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I had to arrange a grand
ghost marriage for you.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,250
And after you came back, I had to
clarify everything in the newspapers.

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,910
Alright, Father.

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,070
I'll go, okay?

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,740
I'm not a child anymore.

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,190
Not a child anymore?

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,830
Fine, then take Xinyue with you.

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Ah?

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,190
Just come with me this once.

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,350
We're not a real couple anyway.

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
There's no need.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Alright.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
You don't have to go.

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,510
But

61
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,190
on second thoughts,

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,350
if you can appear as
the daughter-in-law of the Su Family,

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,390
then the whole city will know.

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,990
People like Tan

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,070
won't dare to cause trouble.

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,390
With Young Master Su around,

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,310
who would dare to bully me?

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,550
That's for sure.

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,670
Actually, I think

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,950
Marshal's banquet probably
won't be that interesting anyway.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,190
(Marshal?)

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,190
Oh, my hand.

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,270
It got hurt hitting Tan.

74
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,430
Alright, I agree.

75
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,160
Thank you very much,

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,120
Miss Du.

77
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,370
Young Master.

78
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,090
A new batch of goods
has arrived at the dock.

79
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,030
Master wants you to pick out a few items

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,990
to bring them over tonight.

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,920
I'll head to the dock then.

82
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
See you tonight.

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
Yes.

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
See you tonight.

85
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,770
Yes.

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,150
Xinyue, look at Ling Hao.

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,820
(Father)

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,150
How exactly did Father die?

89
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,990
We dare not say.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes.

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,480
(Dad,)

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,510
(I will personally kill the murderer)

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,750
(and avenge you.)

94
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,020
(Xingyue Tavern)

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,670
Sorry, we are closed.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,070
Hello, is Miss Du Xinyue here?

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,230
I'm here to see Miss Du.

98
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,310
Chen Xi?

99
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,510
You are... Yao?

100
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,830
Yes, you're back.

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,070
You've grown so tall.

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,920
Yes, I have.

103
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,960
Is your sister here?

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,710
Oh, my sister went out.

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,630
Alright, you carry on.

106
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,790
- I'll come back another day.
- Okay.

107
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,510
- Young Master Su.
- Yes.

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,630
- Young Master Su.
- Hello.

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,150
Young Master Su, you're here.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,110
Come on, have a drink.

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,470
Hey, which young lady is this?

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,950
Am I late?

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,590
No, just in time.

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
Tonight...

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
The moon

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,430
is really beautiful.

117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,310
I'll take you to meet the people
from the chamber of commerce.

118
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay.

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
Xinyue?

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,910
Chen Xi?

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
It's really you.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,020
Long time no see.

123
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,270
Long time no see, Chen Xi.

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,030
Weren't you supposed to watch the shop?

125
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,550
Caiyan told me you weren't coming.

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,910
I even went to the shop to look for you.

127
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Xinyue.

128
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,630
The banquet is about to start.

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's go.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Hey.

131
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,830
Then let's go too.

132
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,980
Please.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,390
- Marshal. Father.
- Hey, Xingluo.

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,790
Marshal.

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
Mr. Su.

136
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,030
Everyone, I appreciate Marshal Zhang
for welcoming my son.

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,000
Chen Xi.

138
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
Thank you, Marshal.

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,950
Oh, don't mention it.

140
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,550
Chen Xi is just like my own son.

141
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay?

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,390
If you fancy any girl

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,390
at the banquet today,

144
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,630
I will arrange it for you.

145
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,710
The saber used to kill him is very unique.

146
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,350
Only two people received this honor.

147
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,670
Marshal Zhang of Luocheng

148
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,190
was one of the recipients.

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,430
I can't say more about this.

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,510

151
