00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,910
Su Xingluo, what are you doing?

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,550
Shh.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,550
Get in and stay quiet.

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
What do you want?

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,670
Is the person inside?

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,900
Young Master Su is taking a bath.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,710
Can't you see he is taking a bath?

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,560
Hurry up, leave.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,600
Go.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
- Search here.
- Yes.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,590
I don't believe we can't catch Red Fox.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,510
- Please be lenient.
- What are you doing?

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,390
We are just running a small business.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,710
Didn't you just search here?

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
Nonsense.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,870
A room over there
hasn't been searched yet.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,110
How dare you say that?

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
What?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,910
Do you enjoy watching me bathe?

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,590
Seeing me isn't enough?

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,070
You also want to see my wife?

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,790
You... He's lying.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,310
Hi, Young Master Su.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,150
What are you two playing at here?

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,030
Aren't I just

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,350
taking my wife out to see the world?

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,430
You do know how to have fun.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,550
Alright, we'll leave you to it.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,750
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,990
Young Master Su, take care.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Stop.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Young Master Su.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,190
Sorry.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,750
Routine check.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,590
- Guards.
- Yes.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,470
- Search Young Master Su.
- Yes.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,630
Chief, Red Fox has escaped!

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,270
Catch him alive!

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Let's go.

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
Okay.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,150
- I...
- Yes.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,140
(Teahouse)

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,510
Hey.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,870
Wait for me.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,590
Is this how you treat your savior?

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,230
Who saved whom just now?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,710
I saw you going out alone at night,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,270
and was worried about you.

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,470
And you, a young lady,

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,070
what are you doing at Baihua Brothel?

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,030
Is there anything fun for you there?

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,950
Or do you just like that place?

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,670
Stop changing the subject.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
You...

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,190
Have nothing to say?

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,710
You

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,950
are the Red Fox, aren't you?

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,230
How could I be the Red Fox?

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,310
Hmm?

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,070
- You...
- Hey, no, I...

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,950
How could I be...

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Young Master.

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,510
I'm exhausted.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,350
I almost led those police officers
to the Xiliang River.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,310
Sorry about that.

68
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440
I got the wrong person.

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,590
Sorry for the disturbance.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Come back.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,040
Young Lady.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,910
You're out for a walk this late?

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,390
You should go back and rest early.

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,070
Aren't your clothes

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,150
Red Fox's?

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,270
No, these are my pajamas.

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,190
Alright.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,280
I am...

79
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,670
I am Red Fox.

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,680
Is that enough?

81
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,750
You are Red Fox?

82
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,400
Shh.

83
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,630
Shh.

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,550
You are the famous Red Fox?

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Yes.

86
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,360
Then,

87
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,430
were the ship and
the warehouse incident your doing?

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,270
Did you investigate me?

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,630
You're not going to kill me, are you?

90
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,390
Hey, have you killed anyone?

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,710
What's it like to kill someone?

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,800
And also,

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,540
well,

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,190
why did you leave that file
for me that day?

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,430
Do you know how my father died?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,790
Can we talk about this back home?

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
It hurts.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Okay.

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,390
This way, this way.

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh, let's go.

101
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,280
You go first.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Okay.

103
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,580
They chased you to the Xiliang River?

104
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,270
They chased you to the Xiliang River?

105
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,070
Let's go, let's go.

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,350
This way.

107
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,360
At first,

108
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,390
I just thought you were strange.

109
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,990
After investigating, I found out more.

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,160
I only know the cause

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,670
of your father's death
from the autopsy report.

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,670
I also know why
you want to kill Marshal Zhang.

113
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,070
He was the one
who caused my father's death.

114
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,830
But with the current evidence,

115
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,830
it can't prove that he is the murderer.

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,830
Besides, even if it was him,

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,390
it would be difficult

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,750
for you to bring him down alone.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,510
But the content of that report
was directed at Marshal Zhang.

120
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,950
Besides, he is involved
in the opium trade too.

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,590
So now we are on the same boat.

122
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,080
Why don't we

123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,550
work together

124
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,790
and both get what we need?

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,190
Let me think about it.

126
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,870
You still need to think about it?

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,190
I agree, okay?

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
Go to sleep.

129
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,070
This is more like it.

130
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,280
Su Xingluo?

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Hey.

132
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
What's wrong with you?

133
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,670
Su Xingluo, are you okay?

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
It's burning.

135
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,160
(No.)

136
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,310
(I need to go buy
anti-inflammatory medicine for him.)

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,670
Want to look at some jewelry?

138
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
Ma'am.

139
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,510
(Pharmacy)
Why are there so many cops over there?

140
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
What happened?

141
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,470
Don't mention it.

142
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,350
Last night, Red Fox caused a big scene
at Baihua Brothel.

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,670
It seems like someone was killed inside.

144
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,310
The police said Red Fox will definitely
come to buy medicine for treatment.

145
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,110
So, they're waiting here to catch him.

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,030
Got it, thank you, ma'am.

147
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,190
Aren't you going to buy something?

148
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,850
Next time.

149
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,670
(What should I do?)

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,830
(If I go, I'll definitely
be caught by the police.)

151
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,270
(There's no other way.)

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,390
(I can only give it a try.)

153
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,110
Stop, what are you doing?

154
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,560
Buying medicine.

155
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,830
Buying medicine? What kind of medicine?

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,220
Anti-inflammatory medicine.

157
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,880
Anti-inflammatory medicine?
Come on, take her down.

158
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
