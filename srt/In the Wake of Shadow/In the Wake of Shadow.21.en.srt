Are you sure about this?

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,310
Do you really want
to appear again as Red Fox?

Xingluo, why are you here?

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,350
This is dangerous. Go.

15
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,070
What are you wearing?

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,750
Stop fooling around. Take it off now.

17
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,310
I am Red Fox.

18
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,790
All these years,

19
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,790
it was me
who was destroying the opium.

20
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,870
You are Red Fox?

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
Yes, I am Red Fox.

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,670
I know what you did.

23
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,430
I just didn't expect

24
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,990
that all these years, I was
fighting against my own father.

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,310
Enough, stop trying.

26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,870
You can't unlock this chain.

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,310
I know I have wronged you

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,310
and your mother.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,070
But all these years,
I have been avenging your mother.

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,510
Revenge is fine,

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,230
but why did you
have to kill innocent people?

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,990
Did you kill

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,790
Xinyue's father?

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,710
Do you know how hard it is
to seek revenge?

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,870
Answer me.

36
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,990
Was it you

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,670
who killed Xinyue's father?

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,950
There's something going on over there.
Go check it out.

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Leave now.

40
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,050
Leave now.

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,110
Leave, I beg you.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,030
Dad, answer me.

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,810
- Leave quickly!
- Dad, answer me.

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,460
Answer me!

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,830
Dad!

46
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,170
Dad, answer me.

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,700
Dad, answer me.

48
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,110
It's time to close the net.

49
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,430
- Here you are.
- Okay, thank you.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
Xinyue,

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
what's wrong?

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,590
Nothing.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,990
Hey, what are you doing?

54
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,300
Let go.

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
Let her go.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Miss Du,

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,870
don't panic.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,630
Marshal Guo wants to invite you over.

59
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,950
There's something to discuss.

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,110
Please, Miss Du.

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,990
We are all rough people.

62
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,270
If you get hurt,

63
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,950
it won't be good.

64
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,190
Hello.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,150
Did you see that girl
over there just now?

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,550
Marshal Guo's men took her away.

67
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,230
Alright, thank you.

68
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,670
Young Master Su.

69
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,710
What should we do?

70
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
Young Master Su,

71
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,270
Xinyue was taken away
by Marshal Guo's men.

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,510
What should we do now?

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,590
I know.

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,710
You both go back.

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,230
I'll handle it.

76
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,870
What does he mean?

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,470
If he doesn't handle it, I will.

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,470
Well, well.

79
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,710
Su Xingluo,

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,110
how did you secretly

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,830
hide such a nice house?

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,150
As expected of the former
playboy of Luocheng.

83
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,990
You really have patience.

84
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
I admire you.

85
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,110
But Marshal Guo said

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,830
all the Su Family's property
is confiscated.

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,590
That means this house belongs to us too.

88
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,910
You don't need to pack.

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,150
Just leave, go.

90
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,150
Du Xinyue

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,150
is still in Marshal Guo's hands.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,350
I know.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,460
You do?

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,030
Then do you know

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,310
that if no one rescues her tonight,

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,390
- she will die?
- Why?

97
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,470
I don't know why.

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,470
I just heard

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,830
that she will be at Baihua Brothel,

100
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,070
waiting for someone to rescue her.

101
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
But

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,150
will there be such a person?

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,270
This is really a nice house.

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,990
Young Master, I'll go with you.

105
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,190
Not this time.

106
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,120
Why?

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,110
Last time you told me
to leave you behind,

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,390
and you almost died.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,510
- This time I...
- Listen to me.

110
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,270
Xinyue and Father
are both with Marshal Guo.

111
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,350
This time, whether I live or die,
I must go.

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,030
If things go smoothly,

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,590
I can bring them back.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,750
I can help you.

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
But

116
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,430
we might also die there.

117
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,830
If you go with me,

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,390
what about Yao?

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,430
How will she manage

120
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,710
on her own
in this perilous Luocheng alone?

121
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,950
Yao...

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,950
If we can't come back,

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,350
you should take her and leave.

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,510
Yao is Xinyue's younger sister,

125
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,190
and you are my bro.

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,190
We don't want to see you get hurt.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,390
You just need to promise me one thing.

128
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
Sure.

129
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,030
Take care of yourself

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,030
and look after Yao.

131
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,030
Take care.
