=Episode 22=

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,800
Who is there?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,430
Finally, you are here.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,280
Stop.

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,950
I didn't bring anything.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,670
Smart move.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,150
You captured them just to get to me.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,470
Let them go, and I'll stay.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,390
You don't seem
to understand the situation.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,150
I didn't ask you here
for something so simple.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,430
I asked you here
so you could all die together.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,190
You don't need to kill them.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
Red Fox.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,910
No, Su Xingluo.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,310
You risked your life to destroy opium.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,710
But it turns out your own father
is the biggest opium dealer.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,990
Don't you find that ironic?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Father.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,230
Father, Father!

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,550
Xingluo.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,510
Don't... Don't blame me.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Xingluo.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,350
Live well.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,630
And get out of here.

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,930
Father!

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,830
As long as the Su Family exists,

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,470
no one will cause trouble
in your tavern again.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,790
(Xingluo, forgive me
for not telling you the truth.)

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,630
(Although I am a businessman,
I have a conscience.)

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,350
(Opium brings disaster
to the country and its people.)

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,150
(Back then, your mother was a doctor.)

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,830
(She saw how opium destroyed lives,)

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,150
(so she was determined
to develop an antidote.)

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,030
(She even tested the poison on herself
but unfortunately, died.)

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,950
(Opium took away my beloved wife)

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,310
(and made you lose your mother
at a young age.)

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,790
(No one in this world
hates opium more than I do.)

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,550
(All these years,)

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,510
(I have pretended to obey Marshal Zhang,)

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,470
(but in reality,)

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,630
(I have been secretly)

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,150
(collecting evidence
of his opium trafficking.)

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,950
(I was too weak)

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,110
(and afraid of
Marshal Zhang's ruthlessness.)

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,590
(But I truly didn't
want you to get hurt.)

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,670
(Unfortunately,)

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,030
(I won't be able to tell you this.)

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,670
Are you done talking?

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,830
Is it you

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,110
or her next?

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
My father

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,190
and Xinyue's father

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,990
both died because of opium.

55
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,470
But people like them

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,630
are still selling it recklessly
for their own selfish desires.

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,870
You left your homes

58
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,270
just to aid and abet evil?

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,590
Go back and tell your families

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,950
that you fought and killed for opium.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,310
Will they be proud of you?

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Come on.

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,230
Kill me now

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,910
and you will lose.

65
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,770
Come on.

66
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,050
Come!

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
Su Xingluo.

68
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,030
Su Xingluo.

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Su Xingluo, Su Xingluo.

70
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,830
Su Xingluo!

71
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Marshal.

72
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,210
Marshal.

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,030
Since they are all dead,

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,270
everything

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,230
will be mine.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,110
Everyone, listen to my command.

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,870
Kill this woman.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
Li.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,580
(Zhang's Shop)

80
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,350
Xinyue, you're awake.

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,470
You finally woke up.

82
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,190
Where is Su Xingluo?

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,790
We tried to save him
all night yesterday.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,870
But...

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Impossible.

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,990
It was the same situation last time.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,790
Everyone thought Su Xingluo was dead,

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,070
but he wasn't.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,910
I saved him last time too.

90
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,230
What?

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes.

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,280
Oh, there's one more thing.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
I never had the chance to tell you.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,350
I was also there
the night your father died.

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,710
That night,

96
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,270
Marshal Zhang invited your father

97
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,110
and President Su to the warehouse
north of the city.

98
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,870
He tried to force them
to agree to distribute opium.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,990
They were firmly against it.

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,270
But your father, being straightforward,

101
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,950
angrily rebuked Marshal Zhang and

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,350
even threatened to report him
to the government.

103
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,550
Marshal Zhang got enraged and then...

104
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,910
So those beads in his hand were...

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,030
When he was gravely injured and fell,

106
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,190
he accidentally broke
President Su's bracelet.

107
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,750
Your father

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,250
was most worried about you.

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,920
I am most worried about Xinyue.

110
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,270
Please tell her

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,510
I'm sorry I can't be with her.

112
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,460
She must live well.

113
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,430
Hold on, I'll take you away right now.

114
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,230
In the end,

115
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,310
we cannot let opium disappear.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,510
I am not willing to accept this.

117
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,480
Du.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Who is it?

119
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,310
What should we do now?

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,870
Red Fox is truly a hero.

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,190
Take good care of your injuries

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,590
and live well.

123
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,990
Only then will you have a chance to reunite.
