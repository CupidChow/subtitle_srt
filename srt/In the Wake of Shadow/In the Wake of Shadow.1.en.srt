=In the Wake of Shadow=

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,780
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
Bronze mirror, oh so bright.

4
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,100
Fair lady in the light.

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,300
Red veil shining, oh so clear,

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,540
Miss Du's tears, they fall so dear.

7
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,700
In the next life, love birds we'll be.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,180
In this life, no regrets meeting thee.

9
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,500
(Xingyue Tavern)
Master Tan is marrying a new wife.

10
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,740
Make way, make way.

11
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,580
Don't stand in the way.

12
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,900
Whose daughter is this?

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,500
- Of all the men, why marry him?
- Extra, extra!

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,810
The Luocheng shipwreck remains unsolved.

15
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,140
No passengers survived.

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,180
It was extremely tragic.

17
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,220
Last night, Red Fox appeared again

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,220
and destroyed the medicine warehouse
north of the city.

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,540
Extra, extra!

20
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,660
(Xingyue Tavern)

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,160
Whose daughter is this?

22
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,540
Of all the men, why marry him?

23
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,100
I took her in out of pity.

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,300
Marrying me is her blessing.

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,540
The girl is not thinking straight.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,020
(Wanted: Heavy Reward for the Capture
of Red Fox and Blue Tail)

27
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,500
Hurry up, it's getting late.

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,820
Stop rushing.

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,700
Xinyue.

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,900
They have arrived?

31
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah, the bridal sedan is almost here.

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,660
They asked me
to put the jewelry on you first.

33
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,660
Alright.

34
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
Xinyue.

35
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,740
Are you really going to do this?

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,980
Xinyue.

37
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,140
Father was...

38
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,940
How exactly did Father die?

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,540
These are photos from the crime scene.

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,460
Check them quickly.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,110
I need to return them when you're done.

42
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,050
(Death Certificate)
The saber used to kill him is very unique.

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,650
It was a commemorative gift
from the government

44
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,510
to honor those with outstanding
military achievements.

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,030
At that time,
only two people received this honor.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,160
(I remember)

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,630
(Marshal Zhang of Luocheng)

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,150
(was one of the recipients.)

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,670
(Could it be...)

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,510
I can't say more about this.

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,390
Only this way

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,830
can we keep the tavern safe

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,150
and uncover the truth
behind Father's murder.

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,830
But you don't have to do this.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Let's go.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,310
King Yan's decree to open the court;

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,070
Golden boys and jade maidens exit the gate.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,750
Flags are fluttering, they come so fast;

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,270
(Deceased son, Su Xingluo)
Chang'an is right before us, at last.

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,830
What bad luck!

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,110
They're jinxing me.

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
The bride is here.

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Step aside.

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Hey.

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Who are you?

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,990
Dare to take my bride.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,030
The Su Family south of the city.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,230
Another Su Family.

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,100
- Who can afford to provoke them?
- Xinyue, take care.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
Young man,

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,150
is there a misunderstanding here?

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,230
This lady is marrying me.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,070
Look, they are still in mourning.

74
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,950
Could it be a ghost marriage?

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,390
Under the master's orders,

76
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,510
we're here to escort Miss Du Xinyue
to marry our young master.

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,310
If any idle people dare to obstruct,

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,710
don't blame us for being rude.

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
This, this...

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,790
Master Tan is so old.

81
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,470
Good for you, Du Xinyue.

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,710
I think you don't want
your tavern anymore.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,560
Zhang!

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,950
Yes, Master Tan.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,230
That woman had to choose the hard way.

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,450
Where is the title deed to the tavern?

87
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,200
Bring it to me.

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,310
Sorry, it was redeemed by the Su Family.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
What?

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,900
(Xingyue Tavern)
When did this happen?

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,390
Just after your threat... No, I mean,

92
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,750
after your proposal.

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,910
Du Xinyue!

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,540
(Double Happiness)

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,430
The ceremony begins.

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,310
First, bow to heaven and earth.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,550
(Double Happiness)
Second, bow to the parents.

98
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,980
(Mistress of the Su Family)

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,710
Third, bride and groom exchange bows.

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,780
(Deceased son, Su Xingluo)
Now go to the bridal chamber.

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,360
Girl,

102
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,470
since you could marry my son,

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,230
I won't make things difficult for you.

104
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Tonight,

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,030
stay in my son's room for one night.

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,350
That will be

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,750
the completion of the ceremony.

108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,870
Our Su Family always keeps its word.

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,390
We will fulfill our promises.

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,950
As long as the Su Family exists,

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,750
no one will cause trouble
at your tavern again.

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,940
(Deceased son, Su Xingluo)

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,070
(There's nothing to fear.)

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,270
(I just need to get through this night.)

115
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Yao.

116
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,150
Yao.

117
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,430
I want some water.

118
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
Who are you?

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,030
You lie in my bed and ask who I am?

120
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,280
