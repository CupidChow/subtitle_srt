(Five years later)

5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,030
(Su Xingluo.)

6
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,630
(It's been five years.)

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,030
(The government has completely
banned the opium trade.)

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,990
(Even those who used to smoke opium)

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,910
(have been forced to quit.)

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,430
(Luocheng has become)

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,710
(the place we always dreamed of.)

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,590
(But why)

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,070
(haven't you come back yet?)

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,710
Here it is.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,070
The wedding dress is ready.

16
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,230
The groom is arriving soon.

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,350
Let's get you dressed quickly.

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,580
(Xingyue Tavern)

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,980
(Double Happiness)

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,510
The bride is here.

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,190
Good for you, young man.

22
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,180
The wedding ceremony begins.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,110
First, bow to heaven and earth.

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,630
Second, bow to the parents.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,430
Third, bride and groom exchange bows.

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,790
Ceremony completed.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Bravo!

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,590
Yao is already married.

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,030
It's really hard to believe.

30
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,150
Yes, time flies so fast.

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,670
A few years pass in the blink of an eye.

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
What about you?

33
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,430
Have you thought about yourself?

34
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,970
You mean...

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,870
Of course, your marriage.

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,950
Xinyue.

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,310
I think we should all move on.

38
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,150
Look, you've redeemed the tavern,

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,190
and it's almost opening a branch.

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,380
Luocheng

41
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,470
is peaceful again.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,230
Now it's time
to think about your own marriage.

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,630
I...

44
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,110
I have already been married.

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,710
I will stay like this.

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,510
I don't plan to marry again.

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,190
Are you going to wait for him forever?

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,630
It's nothing about waiting.

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm used to it.

50
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Caiyan.

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,750
When will you and Chen Xi get married?

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,790
She's asking you.

53
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,910
Why are you looking at me?

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,030
Actually,

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,230
we are already engaged.

56
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,510
That's great!

57
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,660
When did this happen?

58
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,750
Why didn't you tell me?

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,990
Because Chen Xi was afraid...

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,910
I was afraid this

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,030
would bring back your sad memories.
