1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,940
=In the Wake of Shadow=

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,100
(Deceased son, Su Xingluo)

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,180
So,

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,060
all of this was a misunderstanding.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,980
Everyone thought you perished
with that ship,

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,660
but you never boarded the ship.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,540
Yes,

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,580
I have to explain this whole thing
to my father again.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,260
Do you know me?

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,340
I've heard of you.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,060
Then how much do you like me?

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,460
How can I like someone I don't know?

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,180
Then why would a good girl like you

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,380
be willing to marry this block of wood?

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,140
It's not about willingness.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,380
Weird person.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,580
So what do you plan to do next?

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,500
Fulfill the promise.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,660
So you, a living person,

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,620
are going to sleep
next to a memorial tablet?

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,860
Aren't you afraid?

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,300
Of course I'm afraid,

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,540
but there's no other way.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,260
Whatever.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,580
I'm going to bed.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
(Bed...)

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,980
(To bed?)

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,060
(What bad luck.)

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,220
(Why did she follow me here?)

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,660
(We'll just sit here like this?)

31
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,220
(I need to find a way
to get her to leave.)

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,980
(It's already like this,)

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,020
(I might as well go all out.)

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
Hey.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,630
What are you doing?

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,830
(What is he doing?)

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,070
You...

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Will you sleep here?

39
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,910
Yes.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,350
(Seems like a false alarm.)

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,390
(I was overthinking.)

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,950
(This person is really strange.)

43
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,470
(This girl is not to be underestimated.)

44
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,910
(Interesting.)

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,300
=Episode 2=

46
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,800
(Xingyue Tavern)

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,710
It's here, right?

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
Hey...

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
Young Master,

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,910
why are we here?

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Nonsense.

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,510
I got a wife overnight.

53
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,990
I've got to come and check her out.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
Besides,

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,390
have you ever seen a girl
marry a dead person?

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Aren't you curious?

57
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,230
It's not like you're short of girls
chasing you.

58
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,990
There are bound to be some
who are willing to go all out.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,430
She's definitely causing me some trouble.

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,950
I must annul

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,630
the marriage today.

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Xinyue.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,040
Xinyue.

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,750
Why are you here?

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,310
We just got married
and then you disappeared?

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,310
The tavern you risked your life to protect

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,150
is just so-so.

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
What would you like to eat?

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
You...

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,390
Your bracelet...

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,760
My bracelet?

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
What's wrong?

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,430
It's quite pretty.

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,630
I have something else to do.

75
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,850
Young Master Su, please help yourself.

76
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Hey.

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,630
I came today

78
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,110
to talk about annulling the marriage.

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,590
I've already confirmed the marriage
with Master Su.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,510
Is there any problem?

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,950
I understand you want
to protect your father's tavern.

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,910
Now that your goal has been achieved,

83
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
we can annul

84
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,430
the marriage, right?

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,820
(Divorce Letter)

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,910
Honey, please help yourself.

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,670
- Ah!
- Check, please.

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Ling Hao.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,430
Investigate Du Xinyue's background
for me.

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
Yes, Young Master.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Let's go.

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,750
With the current tense situation,

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,470
the Red Fox is causing a lot of trouble,

94
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,390
and you still dares to meet us?

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,310
What is a Red Fox anyway?

96
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,670
If he dares to come, he won't leave alive.

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,080
Let's go.

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,240
Where are the goods?

99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Where's the money?

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,190
Show me the money first.

101
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Come over here.

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,430
The goods are nice. I'll take them all.

103
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,430
Dispose of the bodies completely.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Let's go.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,640
What's going on?

107
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
Who?

108
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Who?

109
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,550
Stop messing around.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,840
Show yourself.

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm exhausted, Young Master.

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,510
Isn't that unnecessary

113
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,390
to bring them out?

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,470
Although they are guilty,

115
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,590
they don't deserve to die.

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,350
Besides, even if they are guilty,

117
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,270
it's not our place to punish them.

118
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,870
Isn't this exactly
what heroes like us are supposed to do?

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,630
Hey, you kid,

120
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,150
you know I wasn't on the ship.

121
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,630
My father arranged
a ghost marriage for me,

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,590
and you didn't stop him.

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,630
How could I stop him?

124
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,550
I can't exactly tell Master

125
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,950
that you are the Red Fox.

126
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,910
You bought a ticket on the surface,

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,110
but actually you were escaping
to destroy the hideout.

128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,750
You're the one to talk.

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,550
That is my lifelong matter.

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
You're the one to talk.

131
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,430
You're the one to talk.

132
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,000
Stop right there. Don't run.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,140
(Chongqing Daxigou Electric Power)

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,350
Over the years,
we've destroyed so many hideouts.

135
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,070
Why does it feel like
the number hasn't decreased,

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,270
but instead, it has increased?

137
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,150
We still need to gather more information

138
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,710
and find out who is behind all this.

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,040
Oh,

140
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
by the way, Young Master,

141
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,430
I've found the information
on Du Xinyue for you.

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,150
It seems this marriage

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,110
cannot be called off.

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,550
Tear down everything here later.

145
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes.

146
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,990
Set up a row of beds over there.

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,390
My opium den doesn't serve the poor.

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,350
The poor can buy from us,

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,950
but they have to go smoke outside.

150
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,190
What are you doing?

151
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,070
This is none of your business.

152
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,190
I'm telling you, I'm here
to take over the shop today.

153
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,110
On what grounds?

154
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
Du Xinyue,

155
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,790
I kindly offered you an easy way before.

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,950
But you insisted on opposing me.

157
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,270
Now, let's see what tricks you have left.

158
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,630
Master Tan, your nose is really sharp.

159
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,030
You came here
just by following the scent.

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,310
Enough with the nonsense.

161
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,910
Once the Su Family
calls off the marriage,

162
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,790
let's see who dares
to take your title deed.

163
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,310
Be quick and hand it over.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,750
Save me the trouble of talking.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,630
What if I don't give it to you?

166
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,710
Master Tan is offering you a way out.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,950
You even dare to slap people!

168
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,150
- So what?
- Get lost.

169
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,550
- Yao!
- How dare you act up in front of me.

170
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,390
Today, I'll show you

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,710
how powerful Master Tan is.

172
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,310
Master, today
it's a double occasion for joy.

173
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,910
Why not consummate the marriage first
and then take over the shop?

174
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Good idea.

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,870
I want to see if she still dares

176
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,790
to slap people in bed.

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,220
Let go of me!

178
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
Let go of me!
