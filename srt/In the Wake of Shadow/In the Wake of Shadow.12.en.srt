3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,430
Put the gun down.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Put it down.

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,670
Young Master Su, are you alright?

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,140
You're fine.

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,510
Young Master Chen.

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,910
We met once before.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,390
You left before we finished talking.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Well,

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,430
let me tell you again.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,950
My daughter is 16 years old and unmarried.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,000
Why don't you consider her?

14
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,830
- Consider her.
- Nice.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,070
I have something to do. I'll leave first.

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,950
Don't go.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,350
Why didn't you let me know

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,950
and went by yourself?

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,800
Don't be afraid.

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,990
I was just worried about Yao.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,870
I acted impulsively.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Xinyue,

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,430
I understand your concern for Yao.

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,270
Thank you, Chen Xi.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,070
You really know how to play the good guy.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,310
Xinyue was just frightened.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,630
Can you stop blaming her all the time?

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,510
Stop talking nonsense.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,790
If it weren't for me,
you would have been beaten to death.

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,190
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,430
- Clearly, I saved you.
- No...

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,790
Chen, count how many people
you knocked down.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,670
Is it your business?

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,150
Stop arguing, both of you.

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
And you,

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,870
don't act on your own in the future.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,110
Why are you being so fierce?

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
Xinyue,

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,830
let me know first if anything happens.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,150
Don't go alone.

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,590
- No, I...
- What are you saying?

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,150
It wasn't my sister, okay?

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
- It was...
- Yao.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,910
But still, thank you both
for saving me and Yao.

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,790
And Caiyan.

46
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,310
It's fine.

47
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,010
It's fine.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,470
Unbelievable.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Let's go.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
Xinyue.

51
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,430
Why didn't you tell Young Master Su

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,350
that it was Miss Jiang
who colluded with those people?

53
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,070
What's the point of saying it?

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,590
The important thing is that we returned safely.

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,950
Come on.

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,430
That woman is jealous
of your relationship with Chen Xi.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,110
Why are you still defending her?

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Maybe...

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,190
Maybe Caiyan was just confused.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,510
Confused? That's not true.

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,110
That woman has no good intentions.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,310
Alright, Yao.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,470
You should go back to sleep first.

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,590
There, there.

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,750
You mean to say

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,310
the three of them just barged in like that?

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,310
Especially those two young men.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,350
They were very fierce
when they started fighting.

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,460
(Xingyue Tavern)

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Ling Hao,

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,630
try the soup I made for you.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,190
See if it tastes good.

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
Yao,

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,710
you brought one bowl of soup

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,670
for both of us?

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Young Master Su,

78
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,470
if you want some,
have Xinyue make it for you.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,430
Exactly.

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,150
Enjoy your soup.

81
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,550
What does this have to do with you?

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,990
Here are your dishes.

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,070
Enjoy your meal.

84
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,250
If you need anything, just call me.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,310
Aren't you Young Master Su?

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,270
Why are you doing this job?

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,470
It's family business.

88
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
Come,

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,110
let me introduce.

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,870
This is Du Xinyue, the shopkeeper.

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,390
As for me,

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,230
you can just call me

93
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,750
"Landlady".

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,830
Enjoy your food and drinks, everyone.

95
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
Enjoy.

96
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,790
Is your injury healed?

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,390
You should rest a few more days at home.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,550
I was just worried.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,720
But don't worry,

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,270
I won't cause you any trouble.

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Besides,

102
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,030
everyone likes me a lot.

103
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,950
You just sit here quietly.

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,910
If you want to eat anything, just say it.

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,150
I'll get it for you.

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,630
How could I trouble you?

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Just sit here.

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
You've finished?

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,870
I'll get you another bowl. Wait here.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Alright.

111
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,990
How does it feel to be a hero?

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Not bad.

113
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,350
Definitely beats working.

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
But actually,

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,150
I wasn't even injured.

116
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,910
Same here, same here.

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,150
Is Miss Du Xinyue here?

118
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
That's me.

119
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,470
Young Master Chen Xi
requests your presence.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,910
Isn't this Chen guy crazy?

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,310
What does he want this late?

122
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,830
Tell him she's not going.

123
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,520
May I ask what Chen Xi wants with me?

124
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,230
Young Master said it's about a clue.

125
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,310
Please hurry over.

126
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,270
I'll go with you.

127
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Okay.

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,550
Let's eat.

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,510
We can enjoy all these dishes.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
Alright.

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,030
I think Chen is probably
just putting on a show.

132
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,310
Chen Xi is a serious person.

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,190
If he called me, it must be because
he found an important clue.

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,510
With his connections,

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,790
I'm better off going myself.

136
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,470
Did you forget about
the last time you got hurt?

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,150
That was...

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,390
Are you worried I'll get hurt?

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,230
Whatever you think.

140
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,870
As long as I can find out the truth
about my father's death,

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,990
I can't afford to miss any clue,

142
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,430
no matter how small.

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,670
Young Master, they are here.

144
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Xinyue.

145
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
Chen Xi.

146
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,630
Why are you here too?

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,590
Isn't it right to come
for family matters?

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,230
Sorry for calling you over so late.

149
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,470
I was recovering from my injuries,

150
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,030
and my father wouldn't let me go out,

151
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,990
so it got delayed.

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,430
How is your injury?

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
It's nothing serious.

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Sir,

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,230
please recount what happened
that day again to this lady.

156
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Yes, Young Master.

157
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,270
That day...

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,710
Zhang, I really can't make it today.

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,910
I'll just take a day off.

160
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,450
- Please cover for me.
- We're one short for the game.

161
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,790
How can we play without you?

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,990
I'll treat you to drinks another day.

163
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,230
Thanks a lot.

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,230
After putting out the fire,

165
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,390
as we were about to take stock,

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,550
we found that someone
had been burned to death inside.

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,150
So we immediately reported it to the police.

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,470
Was it really the Red Fox?

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,070
Of course. The three of us
weren't just sitting around.

170
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,870
After Red Fox injured us,
he set the warehouse on fire.

171
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,790
Look at my injury.

172
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,550
Luckily, I wasn't there.

173
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,230
Stop talking nonsense.
You owe us a meal.

174
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,080
