=Episode 7=

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
Miss Assassin,

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,630
there's something
you need to do with me.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,280
What is it?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,270
Today is my father's birthday.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,270
He asked me to bring you back
to celebrate with him.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,190
I know you don't like such occasions,

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,870
but I really have no other choice.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,200
Okay.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
So you agreed?

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,750
Yes.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,110
Marshal isn't coming today.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,190
Master Su redeemed
the title deed for me.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,590
I should return his favor.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,790
Besides, as a junior, it's only right
to celebrate his birthday.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,280
Is there any problem?

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,310
No problem at all.

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
Then you

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,670
come with me to buy a gift.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Okay.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Let's go.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,840
We've bought the gift.

24
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,750
Let's go check over there.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,990
Pick anything you like.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,110
You can try it on.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,030
Buy it if it fits you.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
Hey.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,230
This is too sharp. Let's pass on it.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
This one is nice.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,920
Yes.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,830
Let me put it on for you.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,440
Okay.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,390
Feel at home.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,030
Ever since my wife passed away,

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,630
it's just us men left in the house.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,750
In the past, during birthdays,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,030
I would exchange pleasantries
with the businessmen during the day.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,470
And at night,

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,790
I wouldn't know what to do
with a table full of dishes.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,510
But today is different.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,670
Xinyue and Yao are here.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,750
The house doesn't feel so empty anymore.

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Come, Father.

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
I wish you

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,710
good health

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,990
and longevity.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,880
Good.

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,150
Let's drink together.

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Xinyue,

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,510
did Xingluo give you a hard time?

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,990
If he did,

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,270
you must tell me.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Dad,

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,630
what do you take me for?

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,230
Xingluo treats me very well.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,150
Don't worry.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
See?

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
What's there to be proud of?

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,710
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,390
Yes, yes, yes.

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,230
Although your marriage
had some twists and turns,

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,190
I'm very pleased seeing you two

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,030
getting along well now.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Come on,

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,230
have a drink with me.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Cheers.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Okay.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,430
Wait.

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,720
Ah...

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,870
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,830
Young Master, drink a little less.

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,880
Don't forget our plan tonight.

74
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,720
Don't worry.

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,270
- I'll pretend to be drunk later.
- Be careful, Xinyue.

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,590
What's up with my sister today?

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,830
She grew up in the tavern.

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,440
How could she get tipsy
after just one drink?

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,550
Why is Young Master so bad
at holding his liquor today?

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,070
(Why isn't she asleep yet?)

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,070
(There's something off
about this guy tonight.)

83
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
(No way.)

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,430
(I can't let him sleep
on the outside.)

85
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,350
Ah, it hurts.

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,550
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,430
She finally fell asleep.

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,710
Just as I expected.

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,510
Young Master, am I good?

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,240
Careful!

91
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Young Master.

92
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Where is he?

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,510
Check over there.

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,790
Red Fox took all the money.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,510
- Search everyone.
- Sir.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
Wow.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,470
What a handsome young man.

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,710
Come play.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
Mm?

100
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,470
I'm not interested today.

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,870
This is for you.

102
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,590
Poor guy.

103
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,880
Ah!

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,030
Hey, there's money.

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,830
- Chase him.
- Don't run.

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,990
He's over there.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,790
- Mama, Mama, help!
- Someone help!

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,030
Someone's causing trouble!

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,710
Hurry up and go.

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,670
Why are you dawdling?

111
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,230
- Young... Young Master.
- Stop.

112
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,230
- Don't run.
- Don't let him get away.

113
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,290
That person looks like your wife.

114
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,120
Chase him.

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
Over there.

116
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,270
- Where?
- Catch her.

117
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,190
Du Xinyue?

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
Go up.

119
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,800
She's on the second floor.

120
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,110
Don't run, stop.

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,590
- Hurry.
- Don't let her get away.

122
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Come on!

123
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
That way.

124
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,480
Shh.

125
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,550
Where is she?

126
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,830
She was just here.

127
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
They're coming in.

128
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Follow me.

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,190
Su Xingluo.

130
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,390
