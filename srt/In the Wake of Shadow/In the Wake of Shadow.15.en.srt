Su Xingluo.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,150
Do you know that people
are searching the entire city for you?

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,190
Are you worried about me?

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,390
I'm serious.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,870
Don't joke around.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,790
If you're worried about me, just say it.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,470
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,150
I am indeed worried about you.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,510
I'm worried that your identity
will be discovered

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,110
and someone might frame you

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,390
with false charges.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,390
I'm afraid
you'll end up like my father...

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,160
Don't worry.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,550
None of that will happen.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,830
I promise you.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,470
I will stay with you forever...

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
Stop talking.

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,790
Okay.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
I will stop talking.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,350
But please don't always
be so anxious, alright?

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,390
You

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,870
can stay at my place tonight.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,160
Alright.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
I'll listen to you.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,990
I mean you and Ling Hao
should stay here together.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,910
Don't go out for the next few days.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,790
Then may I ask
where you plan to hide me?

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,550
Together with the honey brew.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,640
Where is that?

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
Alright.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
Can I eat now?

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,550
Can you tell me now?

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,150
Yes, yes.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,510
I am sure that the person
Red Fox kidnapped that day

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,710
was the shopkeeper of Xingyue Tavern.

41

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,910
I was informed by the higher-ups.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,830
No need for pleasantries.

46
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,790
You investigated the case

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,590
of Xinglong Gambling House, right?

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,830
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,870
You found it a bit suspicious?

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,830
Not exactly.

51
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,950
That day,

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,550
Young Master Su was there.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,190
His name is Su Xingluo.

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,230
I thought he was a playboy,

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,710
but everyone present said
he had extraordinary skills.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,230
He didn't look like
a pampered young master.

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,430
Su Xingluo?

58
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,390
That playboy?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,030
Can you be sure?

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,070
If you allow me,

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,550
I'll bring him here right now.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,270
We'll know the truth
once we interrogate him.

64

No.

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,190
His father is the president
of the Chamber of Commerce.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,790
Acting rashly might not be appropriate.

67
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,310
We need to find another way.

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,790
You mean...

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,310
Lure the snake out of its hole.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,710
Trap him with his own scheme.

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,190
You must be Du Xinyue,
the owner of Xingyue Tavern.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,910

Young Lady asked you
to stay in the room.

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,070
So just stay put.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,230
She went to get my clothes

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,270
but hasn't returned all night.

80
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,590
How can I stay put?

81
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,270
- Young Master Su.
- Wait a bit.

82
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,550
