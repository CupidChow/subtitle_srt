=Episode 9=

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,910
Let go of me.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,510
I came to buy medicine,
why are you arresting me?

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,550
Let go quickly.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
What are you doing?

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,510
Chen Xi.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,230
Xinyue, why are you here?

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,910
Yao got hurt while cooking.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,310
I came to buy some medicine for her.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,390
Hurry up and let Miss Du in.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,630
If Yao's condition worsens,

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,670
can you bear the responsibility?

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340
(Pharmacy)

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,670
Are you the son of Lieutenant Chen?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,190
Marshal Zhang even held
a welcome banquet for you.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,590
I was fortunate to be invited.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,190
Oh.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,870
I was lucky to witness your elegance.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,190
You're truly dashing

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,510
and overflowing with talent.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,390
Especially the music you played
with your delicate fingers.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,590
(Pharmacy)
It was simply mesmerizing.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,350
That feeling...

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,070
How to describe it?

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
It just feels...

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,030
Xinyue, what's going on?

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,630
I'm fine. It's Su Xingluo.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Su Xingluo?

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,150
Why didn't he send a servant?

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,350
I can't explain it to you right now.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,870
I told you before.

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,510
I can help you

34
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,470
with anything Su Xingluo can.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,020
I'm serious.

36
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,350
I know you're serious.

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,310
I know you want to keep the tavern
your father left behind

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,790
and find out the truth about his death.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,790
I can help you with all of that.

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,750
So why do you have to stay with him?

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Just because of

42
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,390
a nominal marriage?

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,630
Xinyue, listen to me.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,110
Ghost marriage is a bad custom.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
It's wrong.

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,110
People abroad advocate free love.

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,950
You shouldn't be trapped
by these outdated things.

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,030
I understand.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,390
Su Xingluo and I

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,910
may have been a mistake
in the first place.

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,950
If that's the case,

52
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,190
why continue making mistakes?

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
How about this.

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,760
Let's go find him to annul the marriage

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,700
and then...

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,510
And then...

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,390
I told my...

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,230
I told my father.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
If

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,390
we were together,

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,310
I wouldn't have to go back this time.

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Chen Xi.

63
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,830
I...

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,950
I just see you as a friend,

65
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,710
a brother from childhood,

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,920
so...

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,510
You don't need to apologize to me.

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,510
You're free

70
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,350
to make your own decision.

71
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,390
I just don't want to see you

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
suffer with him.

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,070
It's not him.

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,070
It's me.

75
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,030
Are we still friends?

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Right?

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,950
If you have any difficulties,

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,590
feel free to come to me.

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,000
Also,

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,230
what I just said

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
is always valid.

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,830
Okay.

83
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,950

Did you sleep well last night?

125
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,650
Yes.

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Xinyue.

127
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,590
The store has recently stocked
a lot of interesting stuff.

128
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,830
Let's go check it out later.

129
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,550
I have to watch the tavern.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,510
I won't go.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,230
You go to the tavern every day.
Just take a day off.

132
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Let Yao keep an eye on it.

133
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,270
I'll ask Ling Hao to help out.

134
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,350
I'm going to the tavern.

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,510
By the way, it's been
quite safe these nights.

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,310
I'll come back by myself after closing.

137
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,430
You don't need to pick me up.

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,950
This one is pretty good.

139
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,270
- All my stuff is the best.
- Yes.

140
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,270
Take a look at this.

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,110
- Su Xingluo?
- Is there anything you like?

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,350
Jiang Caiyan.

143
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,550
What a coincidence.

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,630
You're here to shop too?

145
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,470
Yes, what are you doing?

146
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,190
I'm picking out a gift for Xinyue.

147
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,230
Hey, come here.

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,150
Help me choose one.

149
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Chen Xi.

150
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,430
Thank you for helping me out
at the pharmacy last time.

151
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,470
No problem, it's the right thing to do.

152
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,920
Today I came

153
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,350
because I found some clues.

154
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,570
On the night your father was killed,

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,750
there were actually
three warehouse workers on duty.

156
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,900
I want to find those three people.

157
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,590
We should be able
to get some information from them.

158
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,630
Warehouse workers?

159
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,550
Ling Hao.

160
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Tell me.

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,550
Is Xinyue mad at me?

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,270
But she shouldn't be.

163
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,990
I didn't do anything wrong.

164
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,830
I don't think there's anything wrong.

165
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,910
She told me not to pick her up today.

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,190
Isn't that a bit strange?

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,510
Maybe you're overthinking it.

168
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,470
Maybe.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,750
Actually, you don't need
to worry about Xinyue.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,030
I just saw Chen Xi
go to the tavern to see her.

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,590
I think Chen Xi will take her back.

172
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,160
Miss Jiang,

173
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,920
don't joke around.

174
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,210
Chen Xi?

175
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
