=Episode 10=

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,670
The other two warehouse workers

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,870
died one after another
a month after the incident?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,350
Could this be a coincidence?

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,910
It's still uncertain at the moment.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,310
Let's first hear what the last
warehouse worker has to say.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,270
Ma'am, we are here to see your husband.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,150
Your husband...

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,030
He was always in good health.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,470
But suddenly he fell ill last month.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,510
Thank you.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,470
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you, thank you.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,830
Let's go.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,680
Okay.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,470
Hi, Young Master Su?

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,150
What brought you here?

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,510
What? I'm not welcome?

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,550
Welcome, welcome.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,830
You're more than welcome.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,430
Last time we didn't entertain

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,710
you and your wife well.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,310
Today, your esteemed presence

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,310
has truly brought honor to our Baihua Brothel.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,870
What wife?

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,070
I don't have a wife.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,150
He hasn't come back yet.

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,090
Should be back soon.

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,070
Young Lady.

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,910
Ling Hao, what's the hurry?

31
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,780
Young Master.

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,390
Young Master, he...

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,550
What happened to him?

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,070
- He...
- Speak up.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,070
He's at Baihua Brothel.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,870
He

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,070
asked you to bring wine over.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,550
Ling Hao, what are you saying?

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,590
Xinyue, Baihua Brothel is...

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
I know.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,190
He went to that kind of place,

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
and you still have the nerve
to ask Xinyue?

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,240
She can't go.

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,390
But Young Master insists
you bring the wine over.

45
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,590
Please make a trip.

46
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,310
I said she can't go.
Don't you understand?

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Yao,

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,830
wait for me at home. I'll be back soon.

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,790
Xinyue.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,270
Baihua Brothel is not a place
for girls to go.

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,110
How about I go with you?

52
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,990
No need. Just wait for me at home.

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,950
Ling Hao, lead the way.

54
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,230
Young Lady.

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,270
Young Lady, don't be angry.

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,110
Young Master just...

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,310
He didn't mean it that way.

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,470
You know, right?

59
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,930
Wait.

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,390
Is this a place
you can just enter casually?

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Cut it out.

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,670
This is our young lady.

63
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,910
Then you definitely can't enter casually.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,670
Young Master Su said himself

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,070
that he doesn't have a wife.

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,350
I'm here to deliver something.

67
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,990
There's no need
for you to trouble yourself.

68
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,030
I'll deliver it myself.

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,230
You... Guards.

70
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,110
Stop her.

71
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,470
Young Master is in
the innermost room on the left.

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Hurry up and go.

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,030
I'll see who dares to disturb her.

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,760
Her?

75
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,270
I never took her seriously.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,990
She doesn't mean anything to me.

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,830
I've never had any feelings for her.

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,030
Anyway, she's only

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,430
got eyes for her childhood sweetheart.

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
Du Xinyue.

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,510
Are you going to sit there forever?

82
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,870
I really can't understand.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,030
How am I inferior to Chen?

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,830
Is it just because
he met you before I did?

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,230
I never thought

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,630
you could be so heartless.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
Look at me.

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,750
You think I'm heartless.

89
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,230
I wish I were.

90
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,030
Then I wouldn't have
to be in this brothel,

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,310
listening to you say these things.

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,110
I... I just...

93
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,190
After my father passed away,

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,550
I couldn't bring myself to rely on anyone.

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,350
And I don't want to
rely on anyone anymore.

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,710
I can't bear to lose
someone I love again.

97
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,190
I don't want to go through that pain again.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,670
But after I knew you were here,

99
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,110
I couldn't help myself and came.

100
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,350
This was wrong from the very beginning.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,150
I just wanted to think of it

102
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,790
as a contract that
needed to be fulfilled.

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,190
But I found that I really couldn't do it.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
From now on,

105
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,910
you don't need to worry
about that contract anymore

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,070
and the troubles
that come with marriage.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,270
How about

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,110
we let go of those complex shackles?

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,910
Let us

110
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,150
get to know each other again.

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,070
Is that okay?

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,120
Yes.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
This...

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
This is something

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,310
I carefully selected for you.

116
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,070
From now on, no matter what happens,

117
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,670
whether it's good or bad,

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,510
I hope you can be honest with me.

119
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,480
Okay.

120
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,000
And,

121
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,270
you are not allowed to go
to Baihua Brothel anymore.

122
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,830
I swear.

123
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Besides,

124
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,470
that was my first time going there.

125
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,750
First time, huh?

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,710
Last time doesn't count.

127
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,750
Last time, I was just trying to...

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,550
To make me angry, right?

129
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,930
Does it look good?

130
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,150
Yes.

131
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,790
- (It's really nice)
- (It's really nice)

132
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,830
- (to have you with me.)
- (to have you with me.)

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
What's wrong, Young Master?

134
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Nothing.

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,040
Xinyue.

136
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,190
What's wrong? You got a cold?

137
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Nothing.

138
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,810
Young Master Chen Xi,

139
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,870
we've found news about the person

140
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,870
you are looking for.

141
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,150
Do you need me to bring him here?

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes, please.

143
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,180
Yes.

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,750
Don't use any violence.

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,030
Just invite him over.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,990
I only have a few questions for him.

147
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,120
Understood.

148
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
