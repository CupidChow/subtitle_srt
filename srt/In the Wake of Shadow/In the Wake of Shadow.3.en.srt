Four sticks.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,350
Well arranged.

00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,400
Green dragon.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,390
Oh, Young Master Su.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,710
That's why I have to play with you.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,830
Oh my, you...

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,310
You've hit it big.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,510
Big three dragons.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,630
Your luck is amazing.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,470
I have something good for you.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,600
Let's go, let's go.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
Wait for me.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,620
(Red Fox Strikes Again)
Xinyue.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,110
This Red Fox is really ruthless.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,070
He probably hates
these opium dealers too.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,830
I heard Young Master Su
has annulled the marriage.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,830
Keep your voice down.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,870
But it's understandable.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,790
Young Master Su is the one
everyone desires but can't have.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,430
Young Master Su

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,830
is really a playboy.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,950
I wonder what he's planning.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,470
- Ma'am, I'm leaving.
- Take care.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,950
Xinyue,

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,670
aren't you worried at all?

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,790
Shouldn't you think of a solution?

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,550
We can't rely on others.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,030
Let's think of another way.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,000
But...

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,710
- Tear down everything here later.
- Yes.

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,630
Set up a row of beds over there.

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,070
My opium den doesn't serve the poor.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,990
The poor can buy from us,

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,550
but they have to go smoke outside.

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,830
What are you doing?

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,790
This is none of your business.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm telling you, I'm here
to take over the shop today.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,670
On what grounds?

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,870
Master Tan, your nose is really sharp.

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,270
You came here
just by following the scent.

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,590
Little girl,

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,510
do you really think
you can rise to greatness?

46
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,900
I heard

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,190
you recently got a good cricket.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Hey,

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,470
I just so happen

50
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,990
to have a good cage.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,750
I don't need it,

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
so why don't you

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
take it?

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,470
Young Master Su,

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,910
no gains without pains.

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,310
How can I accept this?

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,910
Don't be so polite.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,550
A great gift is for a great man.

59
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,760
Right?

60
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,610
Young Master Su,

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,990
as long as you say the word,

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,070
I will definitely
try my best to get it done.

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,550
You said it yourself.

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Just tell me.

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,030
Five years ago,

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,230
Master Du was killed.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,870
Are you aware of that?

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Well,

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,390
at that time,

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,510
I hadn't been transferred
to this district yet.

71
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,510
Are there any records

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
at the Police Station?

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,790
Yes, there are.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
But

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,150
it's not very convenient.

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,700
Hey.

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,950
If you can't do it, it's fine.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
It's not a big deal.

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,570
Young Master.

80
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
Ah?

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,990
I'll go take a look. Let's go.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,430
Young Master Su, you go ahead.

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,430
- Hey.
- Hey, this cage...

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
You keep it.

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,150
Thank you, Young Master Su.

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,280
Well.

87
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,580
(Xingyue Tavern)
We are closed.

88
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Please leave.

89
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,830
Master Tan is offering you a way out.

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,630
You even dare to slap people!

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,030
- So what?
- Get lost.

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,510
- Yao!
- How dare you act up in front of me.

93
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,190
Today, I'll show you

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,670
how powerful Master Tan is.

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,150
Master, today
it's a double occasion for joy.

96
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,790
Why not consummate the marriage first
and then take over the shop?

97
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,190
Good idea.

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,670
I want to see if she still dares

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,230
to slap people in bed.

100
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Hold her down.

101
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Let go of me!

102
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,750
Let go of me!

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,750
Let go!

104
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,350
Don't touch me!

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
Well,

106
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,550
are you guys busy?

107
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,870
Su,

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,070
this has nothing to do with you.

109
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,430
Don't meddle in this.

110
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Get lost!

111
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,110
Move aside, move aside.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,030
Nothing to do with me?

113
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,470
- Don't hit my face.
- Nothing to do with me?

114
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Yao.

115
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,480
Nothing to do with me?

116
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,910
Nothing to do with me?

117
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Nothing to do with me?

118
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,830
Ling Hao! Knife!

119
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
Stop it.

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Do you submit?

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,430
I submit, I submit.

122
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,480
Are you okay?

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Listen up.

124
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,470
Du Xinyue is my wife.

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,150
If you dare to touch her again,
you're going against me.

126
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Got it?

127
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,750
Got it, got it.

128
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
Get out.

129
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
(Xingyue Tavern)

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,350
Who hit you?

131
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,950
Master Tan's man.

132
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,030
Next time, I'll help you get revenge.

133
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,630
(Why isn't he saying anything?)

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
Just now,

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,870
thank you for helping me out.

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,190
But weren't you

137
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,710
quite fierce before?

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,390
(Since the tavern is now safe,)

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,710
(I can't hold him back.)

140
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,830
If you want to annul the marriage,
I understand.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,870
Well,

142
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm sleepy.

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
Going back to sleep.

144
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Ah...

145
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
Du Xinyue.

146
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
Let's go.

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,750
