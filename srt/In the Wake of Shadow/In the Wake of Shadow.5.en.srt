Xin

-yue.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,390
Let go of me, Su Xingluo.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,110
What do you want?

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,870
Aren't you afraid I might stab you?

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,630
Try it.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,550
Do you believe I will kill you?

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Go ahead.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,630
Finish this dance with me.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
You two...

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Su Xingluo.

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Chen Xi.

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,310
Let me introduce her officially.

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
Du Xinyue

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,050
is my wife.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,030
Your son is good.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,630
Xinyue.

21
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,630
Xinyue.

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,670
Is this how you treat your savior?

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Don't you want it?

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
It's none of your business.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,990
I just saw
you didn't have a dance partner.

26
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,670
You can't finish the dance alone.

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,590
Even so,

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,550
why did you...

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
What?

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Why...

31
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,270
Don't go.

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,390
You really got angry?

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Sorry.

34
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,710
Sorry.

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,310
I originally thought you
just looked a bit like a playboy.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,190
I didn't expect you to be so frivolous.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,510
Let me tell you.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,590
Although I signed a contract
with your family,

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,190
I won't let you manipulate me.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,190
Don't you want to annul the marriage?

41
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,310
Let's do it now.

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,470
I originally thought

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,830
you were just a pitiful,
forsaken princess.

44
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,430
But I didn't expect you to be so vicious,

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,670
even planning to assassinate people.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,550
Let me tell you,

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,110
I won't annul the marriage.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,270
And I won't let you run amok.

49
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Hey.

50
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,870
Who was that guy playing the piano?

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,550
What does that have to do with you?

52
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,310
Why doesn't it have to do with me?

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,110
Everyone knows we are married,

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,630
and he still dared
to touch you in front of me.

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,480
Tell me,

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,590
isn't that too disrespectful to me?

57
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
First of all,

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,990
who he is and what his name is
has nothing to do with you.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Secondly,

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,030
my business is none of your concern.

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
Stay away from me.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,230
What do you mean
it has nothing to do with me?

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,390
It has everything to do with me.

64
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,430
Whether the assassination succeeds
or not is another matter.

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,110
Do you know how many guards
Marshal Zhang has around him?

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,510
Do you know the consequences
of doing this?

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,830
If it weren't for the fear
of implicating the Su Family,

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,230
I wouldn't bother with you.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Fine.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,230
Young Master Su,

71
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,190
it's all my fault.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
Is that enough?

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,790
Can I leave now?

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Tell me,

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,110
what kind of grudge
would make her take such a risk?

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,430
Young Master,

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,750
are you stupid?

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,190
He killed her father
and wants to steal your wife.

79
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,150
So it has something to do
with her father.

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,640
Oh my,

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,470
you still don't get it.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,510
He wants to steal your wife.

83
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
Steal my wife?

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,420
Steal my wife? Steal my wife?

85
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,390
Steal my wife?

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Can't believe you.

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,550
Young Master, please stop.

88
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,950
(I was a bit impulsive.)

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,910
(He was really frivolous.)

90
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,790
(So embarrassing.)

91
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,670
(Why is he tossing and turning?)

92
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,550
- (Oh, forget it.)
- (Forget it.)

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,070
- (Go to sleep.)
- (Go to sleep.)

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,150
It's hard to imagine how a girl like you

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,550
has to bear so much suffering.

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,670
After all this time,

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,550
I've gotten used to it.

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,790
But there's one thing

99
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,110
I don't quite understand.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Tell me.

101
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,510
Since Young Master Su is still alive,

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,830
your marriage should be null and void.

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,230
But why

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,230
is he still clinging to you?

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,510
I don't know either.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,990
I don't have time
to think about that now.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,350
I just want to find out the truth
about my father's death.

108
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Don't worry,

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,470
I will definitely help you
get to the bottom of it.

110
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,430
Since I'm back,

111
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,550
no matter who the culprit is,

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,030
I will get you the truth.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,240
Chen Xi,

114
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,830
Uncle Chen has been
following Marshal for years.

115
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,470
I'm afraid it might implicate you.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,990
So you'd better not get involved.

117
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,870
But just because of one pearl,

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,790
it doesn't prove
Marshal is the murderer.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Well,

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,550
I'll help you investigate.

121
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
During this time,

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,790
don't act rashly.

123
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,470
- But...
- Give me a chance to help you.

124
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
Trust me.

125
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
Okay?

126
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Okay.

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,910
Hey, do you remember
we went to play on the mountain

128
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,270
when we were kids?

129
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,510
When we were leaving,
it was almost as dark as it is now.

130
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,830
You were so scared you almost cried.

131
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,750
I was also terrified.

132
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,710
Ouch!

133
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Oh.

134
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,190
Hey, hey, hey.

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,630
Are you okay?

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,550
It hurts. It hurts.

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,510
Chen Xi.

138
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
What are you doing?

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,270
You look pretty rich.

140
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,430
I want to get some money
from you to buy cigarettes.

141
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,350
Xinyue, let's go.

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,710
- Hey, Chen Xi.
- Xinyue.

143
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,560
Xinyue.

144
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
- Let go!
- Let go of me!

145
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,520
Chen Xi.

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Let go!

147
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
Ah!

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,870
Xinyue.

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,830
What are you going to do?

150
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Ah!

151
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Let go of me.

152
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,040
Red Fox?

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Xinyue.

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,550
Xinyue, are you okay?

155
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,270
- I'm fine.
- Let's go.

156
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,240
Okay.

157
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,270
If you want money, that's fine.

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,120
Chen Xi.

159
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,720
Chen Xi.

160
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,150
Red Fox stole important documents

161
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,160
- and got a gunshot wound.
- Chen Xi.

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
He can't have gone far.

163
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,430
- Xinyue.
- Hurry and chase him.

164
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
Help...

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,230
Where is he? I just saw him.

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,830
He got shot. He can't have gone far.

167
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,350
- (He's injured.)
- Check over there.

168
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440
Let's go.

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,990
(Then I'll see)

170
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,110
(who the famous)

171
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,230
