3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,020
(Xingyue Tavern)

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,660
(Red Fox Raid,
Two Places in the City Caught Fire)

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,710
Recently, Red Fox
has been quite obtrusive.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,030
Yes, it's making everyone panic.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,590
It's said that he only targets those
who smoke that stuff.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,350
Ma'am, check please.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,200
Okay.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,710
Miss Du Xinyue.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,270
Young Master Chen Xi
asked you to come over.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,790
Where to?

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,310
He only mentioned it's related to a clue.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,430
Please hurry.

15
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,330
Let's go.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,790
Young Master.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,270
Miss Du has arrived.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,270
Chen Xi, what's wrong?

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
Sorry, Xinyue,

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,950
for calling you over so late.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,390
Is something wrong?

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
No, nothing.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,870
I really miss those days

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,390
when we were kids.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,520
I was especially happy.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,740
Young Master.

27
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,030
It's almost time.

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,950
I should go back, Xinyue.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,720
Chen Xi.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,630
Miss Du, please.

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,540
(Zhang's Shop)

32
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,990
I promised you
I would catch Red Fox for you

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,270
to avenge your father.

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,110
But while reviewing the files,
I found other clues,

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,550
and uncovered part of the truth.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,350
Now that your father's matter
has come to an end.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,990
You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,870
Because your enemy

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,270
is very likely no longer alive.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,430
For the specifics,

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,630
you will understand once you read

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,110
the note I left you.

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,430
I hope you stay safe and happy.

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,830
By Chen Xi.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,590
Later, I found out from the newspaper

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,430
that Red Fox burned the warehouse
in the south of the city that night,

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,110
not in the north.

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Zhang

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,150
falsely claimed that the warehouse fire
was caused by Red Fox

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,150
to cover up his own negligence.

51
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,790
He even injured himself as part of the ruse.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Su Xingluo.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,150
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Your face...

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,870
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,270
Here to seek revenge on me?

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560
No.

58
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,670
Chen Xi gave me this.

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,160
I...

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,990
I wronged you.

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
Su Xingluo.

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,910
If it weren't for this piece of paper,

63
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,830
would you really believe

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,430
that I murdered your father?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,750
Am I less trustworthy
than a piece of paper?

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
No,

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,830
I just needed evidence.

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,030
Your arm...

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Su Xingluo!

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,260
(Marshal's Mansion)

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,230
Red Fox must be eliminated.

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,510
I guarantee that his body will be displayed
in the center of Luocheng.

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,710
Don't make me wait too long.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
You're awake.

75
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,350
How are you feeling?

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Young Master!

77
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
Where are you going?

78
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,990
I'm going to the tavern.

79
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,390
There are things to be taken care of.

80
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,310
I'll go with you.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,870
You're still injured.

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,310
You should stay home and rest.

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,750
These are just minor injuries.
I can manage.

84
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,590
Be good. I'll be back soon.

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,870
I'll bring you some food later.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,030
Come back early then.

87
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,930
Ling Hao,

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,910
keep a close eye on your young master.

89
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,910
Don't let him wander off.

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,030
Don't worry, Young Lady.

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm leaving.

92
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,110
Still not giving up?

93
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
What?

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,670
I was the one who told your father.

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,190
Why did you do that?

96
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,870
Because there are things
you need to know.

97
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,390
You and Du Xinyue can't be together.

98
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,610
Have you heard?

99
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,270
Someone was transferred
from another province

100
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,550
specifically to hunt down Red Fox.

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,550
Now he has nowhere to run.

102
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Xinyue,

103
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,990
what are you thinking about?

104
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,670
Nothing.

105
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,430
Why do you seem so strange?

106
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,950
Did Young Master Su bully you again?

107
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
No.

108
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,710
I just feel like something big
is about to happen on the street.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,110
I'm a bit worried...

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,030
Worried about the tavern's business.

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,910
They are here for searching Red Fox.

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,910
What does it have to do with us?

113
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Don't worry.

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,980
(Xingyue Tavern)

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,550
(He hasn't been caught
for so many years.)

116
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,110
(They probably won't catch him now.)

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,070
(But he was discovered by me.)

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,310
(So others might too...)

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,350
(No, we are husband and wife.)

120
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,270
(It's different.)

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,630
(During this time,
try to keep him indoors.)

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,600
Hey, ma'am.

123
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,550
Why hasn't my food been served yet?

124
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
Why are you...

125
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,750
Didn't I tell you to wait at home?

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,030
Why are you here?

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,390
I did wait.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,870
But I got too hungry.

129
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,030
After all, he is the Young Master.

130
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Ling Hao.

131
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,510
- Yao.
- There you are.

132
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,030
This is what that table ordered.

133
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
- Help me deliver it over.
- Okay.

134
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm hungry.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,230
Then go wait in the bedroom.

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,590
I'll cook noodles for you now.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Go quickly.

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm going.

139
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,600
Impossible.

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,390
My father cannot be the murderer.

141
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,790
I heard it myself.

142
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,950
After you left, the warehouse manager

143
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,550
said Lieutenant Chen set the fire.

144
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,510
If you don't believe me,
ask him yourself

145
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,350
and see if it's true.

146
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,230
I'll leave the food here.
