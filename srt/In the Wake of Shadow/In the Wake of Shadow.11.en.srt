=Episode 11=

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,230
I told you to kidnap Du Xinyue.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,230
I don't care.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,350
You didn't make it clear.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,550
Anyway, I brought her here.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,950
So, what do we do now?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,870
You kidnapped the wrong person.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,990
Excuse me, have you seen Yao?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,590
Ms. Du, you're finally here.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,710
I saw she was taken

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,510
to Xinglong Gambling House this morning.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,310
Xinglong Gambling House?

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,830
Who are you looking for?

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
Where is Yao?

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Bring her out.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,350
Yes.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Yao.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,360
Xinyue.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,590
Why did you capture her?

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,390
We were actually after you.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,600
Me?

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,310
Someone asked me to tell you

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,070
to stay away from Chen Xi.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,510
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,790
Just remember it.

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
Yao!

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
Xinyue.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,870
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,790
Yao, don't be afraid.
I'll take you home.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,160
Let's go.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,430
She can go.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,390
- But you have to stay.
- Why?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,910
I've changed my mind.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,950
She can exchange for you.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,510
- Are you willing?
- I'm not willing.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,750
In that case,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,110
you both have to stay.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
Stop!

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Let go, let go.

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,510
Let her go. Scarface.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,030
I only told you to scare them.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
What are you doing?

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,590
This is none of your business.

45
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,150
You told me to kidnap her.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,550
I already did.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,590
As for the rest,

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,030
I call the shots.

49
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,710
I paid you.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,870
Yes.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,710
What are you doing?

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,630
Xinyue. Xinyue?

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Xinyue?

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
Yao?

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,190
Where are they hiding?

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Yao?

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,790
- Xinyue?
- Yao?

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Is she there?

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,670
No.

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
Where is she?

61
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,730
Xinyue?

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,590
Where did she go?

63
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,690
Xinyue.

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,510
What are you doing here again?

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,230
I'm here to see Xinyue. What's wrong?

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,430
Xinyue.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
She's not here.

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,710
Then where did Xinyue go?

69
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,230
How should I know?

70
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,870
- Li.
- Ling Hao.

71
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Yes.

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,870
Young Master, we found out.

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,440
They are at Xinglong Gambling House.

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,390
What is she doing there?

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,470
- It's none of your business.
- You...

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,510
Wait a moment, Young Master.

77
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,600
Better take him along.

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,670
More people, more support.

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,790
Chen, come with us.

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,070
But don't be a burden.

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,830
Take care of yourself first.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't be afraid.

83
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,600
Sir.

84
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,910
Those three girls are so delicate.

85
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,310
Since we're idle,

86
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,630
why not let us have some fun?

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,670
That could work.

88
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,190
But don't break them.

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Or we won't get a good price later.

90
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,510
Don't worry, sir.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,030
I'm always nice to pretty women.

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,910
I'll kill you.

93
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,070
What a feisty girl.

94
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,240
Don't come any closer.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,230
What are you doing?

96
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,830
- Let go!
- Let go of me!

97
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,230
Help!

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,140
Let go of me!

99
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,670
Let go of me!

100
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,450
What are you doing?

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,800
Who are you?

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,910
Ling Hao! It's Ling Hao, Xinyue.

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,470
Su Xingluo, save me!

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,390
Chen Xi, I'm here! Chen Xi!

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,950
Troublemakers.

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,310
- Get them.
- Young Master, save them.

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,350
I'll hold them off.

108
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,150
Come on.

109
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Su Xingluo.

110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,980
- Chen Xi.
- Are you okay?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,150
- Chen Xi, I'm here too.
- Are you hurt?

112
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,230
Why did you come so late?

113
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,190
Caiyan?

114
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
My feet.

115
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,830
Xinyue.

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,630
Are you okay?

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,790
You always like to cause trouble.

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,070
Why are you blaming me?

119
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,670
It's good that you're okay.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Let's go.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,780
Stop.

122
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,950
Stop.

123
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
