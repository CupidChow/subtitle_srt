3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,470
(He's injured.)

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,120
(So)

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,750
(she's that girl.)

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,940
Mother.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,170
Mother.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,390
I miss you so much.

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,590
Have you lost your mother too?

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,070
Yes, my father said
she went to a very faraway place.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,870
Where did she go?

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,790
The servants said
my mother left because of opium.

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,320
My father doesn't want to talk about it.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
Humph.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,070
It's this bad thing again.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,390
What exactly is this thing?

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,990
My mother told me it's a kind of poison.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,510
She went to heaven
to develop an antidote.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,550
You look younger than me,

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,110
but you're much stronger.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,230
When my mother left, she told me

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,270
she would turn into a star
to protect the one she loves the most.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,470
It's okay.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,790
In the future, I'll turn
into a star to protect you.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,910
I want to burn all the bad things

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,230
so no other child will lose their mother.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,950
(Then I'll see)

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,110
(who is)

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,230
(the famous Red Fox.)

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,720
Young...

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,750
Luckily, I arrived in time.

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,510
You hit too hard.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
Really?

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,270
I was actually thinking of using a stick.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
You little rascal.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,110
Do you have to be so rough?

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,510
I didn't want to either.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,830
But if I hadn't acted
at the critical moment,

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,550
she would have discovered us.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,990
I meant when you're applying the medicine.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,390
Do you have to be so rough?

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,430
Xinyue, you're awake.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
How are you feeling?

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,430
Anywhere still hurting?

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm fine.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh.

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,510
When we found you earlier,

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,190
we saw this file beside you.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,590
It must have been left by Red Fox.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
File?

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,510
(Last night, I remember
when the police were chasing him,)

52
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
(they said he stole important documents
from the Police Station.)

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,830
(Could it be this one?)

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,750
But why would Red Fox
leave the file for me?

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,070
I don't know.

56
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,830
Let's first see what's in it.

57
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,230
According to this file,

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,990
the warehouse that burned that night
was a pharmaceutical warehouse.

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,430
The supplies inside
were anti-opium drugs.

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,830
Anti-opium drugs?

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,230
But the newspaper reported it
as a food warehouse.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,790
Why is that?

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,750
Why did the newspaper
conceal the truth?

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Did your father

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,470
have any connection
with the opium trade?

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,350
My father despised opium
more than anything.

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,390
Because my mother

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,590
died from an overdose of opium.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,870
Then how is all this

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,950
related to Marshal Zhang?

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Chen Xi,

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,910
do you know what anti-opium drugs are?

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,440
I don't know.

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,640
But,

75
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,590
we can ask someone who knows.

76
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Get lost!

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,150
No money and still want a free smoke?

78
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,290
Go away!

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Please,

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,510
just let me have one puff.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,430
Just one puff.

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,790
Have some mercy.

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,470
Just one puff.

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,830
I'll pay you back next time.

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,750
Can I ask you something?

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,470
Do you have any goods?

87
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
No goods,

88
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,830
but I can give you money.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,350
Do you know

90
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,030
what anti-opium drugs are?

91
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,150
Anti-opium drugs?

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,750
That's just opium

93
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,550
under a different name.

94
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,110
But let me tell you,

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,950
it's selling much better than before.

96
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,990
But why change the name?

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,350
I don't know why they changed it,

98
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,710
but I do know

99
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,830
this is the most profitable business
in the world.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,790
If I had the money,

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,070
I would do it too.

102
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,350
They're so bold.

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,990
No wonder my father
complained about their rampant selling,

104
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,750
but no one paid attention.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,790
Are you finished?

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,270
Time to pay me.

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,870
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

108
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,110
Since Uncle Du hated opium,

109
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,990
why did the report say
he went to the warehouse to steal?

110
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,470
The warehouse suddenly caught fire,

111
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,550
perhaps Uncle Du

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,590
was accidentally involved.

113
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,190
There must be something wrong here.

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,070
But where exactly is the problem?

115
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,470
Xinyue,

116
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,310
let's go back and sort out
our thoughts first.

117
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
Okay.

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Put it over there.

119
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,150
I will get to the bottom of this.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,610
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,550
This is my wife's tavern.

122
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,390
Is it not normal for me to be here?

123
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,750
Playboy.

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,150
Did you know Xinyue was in danger

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
last night?

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,030
Do you really care about her?

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,510
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,190
If it weren't for you
asking her out late at night,

129
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,870
would she have been in danger?

130
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,390
Don't you know she's a married woman?

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,270
After studying abroad for so many years,

132
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,150
you still don't understand
this basic etiquette?

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,510
- You...
- Stop it.

134
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
Shameless.

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,630
Well, Chen,

136
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,270
I'm here to see my wife.

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,550
What does it have to do
with an outsider like you?

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,950
Your wife?

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,390
Don't think I don't know.

140
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,990
Your marriage was a complete misunderstanding.

141
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,550
If Xinyue hadn't been in trouble,

142
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,790
she wouldn't have married you.

143
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,480
Do you have the nerve
to cling to her every day?

144
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Fine.

145
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,790
It's not your place to speak.

146
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Xinyue.

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Tell me,

148
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,590
was our marriage consensual?

149
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,330
I...

150
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,020
I...

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,190
Forget it.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,790
Xinyue, I don't want to force you.

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,550
Sorry, Chen Xi.

154
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,950
Although this was a misunderstanding,

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,230
I'm indeed married into the Su Family.

156
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,110
- Xin...
- Hey.

157
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,680
Xinyue.

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,710
I bought you something delicious.

159
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,070
Let's go back to our room

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,550
to eat together later.

161
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
