00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,780
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
You look

4
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
really beautiful today.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,110
I've waited so long for this.

6
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,800
The wedding ceremony begins.

7
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
(Su Xingluo)

8
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,180
(Du Xinyue)

9
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Father.

10
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
Good.

11
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
Xinyue.

12
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,030
This is an heirloom of our Su Family.

13
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,230
It's time to pass it to you now.

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,830
Thank you, Master Su.

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,430
Thank you, Father.

16
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,950
This bracelet was originally a pair,

17
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,230
but one was accidentally lost.

18
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,550
But because of this,

19
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,070
the remaining one

20
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,910
is as unique as you are.

21
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,510
Where did this come from?

22
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,350
This is a family heirloom

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,790
given to you by Father.

24
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Why?

25
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,950
Why is this happening?

26
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
What's wrong?

27
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,070
Why is this happening?

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,150
What's wrong?

29
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,070
Xinyue, what's wrong with you?

30
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,510
(Marriage Certificate)
I'll kill you!

31
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
Xinyue.

32
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,350
Su Xingluo.

33
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,510
From today onwards,

34
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,270
I sever all ties with you.

35
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,300
Xinyue.

36
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,110
Father.

37
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,270
What exactly is going on?

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Xingluo.

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Master Su.

40
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,630
Am I coming at a bad time?

41
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,030
Since you know it's a bad time,

42
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,950
please leave.

43
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,870
But today is your deadline.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,150
What is your answer?

45
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,590
I disagree.

46
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
It seems

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,830
you are opposing Marshal Guo.

48
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,110
I have no intention
of opposing Marshal Guo.

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,390
But as the president
of the Chamber of Commerce,

50
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,630
I cannot agree to triple the taxes.

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,790
That's why Marshal
gave you other options.

52
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
Father.

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,310
What is he talking about?

54
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,350
This must be Young Master Su.

55
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,510
Congratulations, Young Master Su.

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,470
I came in too much of a hurry.

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
I will make it up

58
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,910
another day.

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,470
It seems your Su Family

60
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,990
is also in chaos.

61
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,430
This is none of your business.

62
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,590
Father, are you hiding something from me?

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,350
Young Master Su, you don't know yet.

64
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,070
Marshal Guo said

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,990
that all merchants in the city

66
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,830
are taxed 70% of the income

67
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,270
from taking over opium trade.

68
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,180
What?

69
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,270
This is outrageous.

70
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,990
Master Su, it's just about business.

71
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't take it to heart.

72
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,510
Everyone knows that

73
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,830
opium harms people.

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,070
What you are doing is no different from

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,270
killing people indiscriminately.

76
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,630
- How dare you!
- Come on!

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,430
Is your family

78
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,870
planning to openly rebel today?

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Master Su,

80
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,150
you're no different from us.

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,870
- Guards!
- Yes.

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,230
Su Jun'an obstructs the new policy.

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,590
All the Su Family's property

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,910
is now confiscated.

85
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,150
Take him back with us too.

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
- Yes!
- Stop.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,950
I can go with you.

88
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
But

89
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,150
you can't touch my son.

90
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,500
Father.

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,510
All debts owed

92
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,190
must be repaid.

93
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,270
I'm sorry to you.

94
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
