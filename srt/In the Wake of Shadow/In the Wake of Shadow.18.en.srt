=Episode 18=

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,790
That day, after you left,

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,830
Marshal sent people to chase you.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,190
I found out about it.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,270
Just as I was about
to perish with him,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,030
an explosion suddenly occurred
outside the warehouse.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,840
Explosion?

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,910
You're still injured, don't move around.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,150
You saved me.

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,870
It was just your luck.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,310
You survived the explosion.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,790
You caused the explosion?

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,310
You wanted to kill Marshal Zhang?

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,510
We knew Marshal Zhang would
come to this warehouse to catch you.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,750
So we planted bombs
around the area in advance,

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,160
planning to take him out

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,430
with one strike when he tried to escape.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,630
Marshal Zhang is naturally cautious.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,830
If you hadn't pushed him to the edge,

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,790
we wouldn't have succeeded so easily.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,190
You were the key
to our mission this time.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,270
Who exactly are you?

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,550
I share the same ideals as you.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,870
However, I work for an organization.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,230
Realizing the world you envision
is not an overnight task,

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,790
nor can it be done single-handedly.

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,150
I am about to be transferred to Xicheng,

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,750
so I need to leave soon.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,870
Before I leave, I have left you a gift.

31
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,250
What is it?

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,910
Regarding the identity of Red Fox,

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,910
I have already taken care of it for you.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,470
No one will investigate you anymore.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,110
There will also be no more opium
in Luocheng in the short term.

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,230
From now on, you can

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,470
be Su Xingluo again at ease.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,350
So we were all part of his plan?

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
Yes.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
However,

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,190
now these things
are no longer important.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,710
What matters now is

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,870
that I can stay by your side from now on.

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Time to sleep.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Then,

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,670
do you want to...

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,580
(Xingyue Tavern)
Coming, coming.

48
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,780
- Here is yours.
- Ling Hao,

49
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,750
your young master seems off.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
What's going on?

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,280
No wine?

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,830
- Alright, got it.
- The guests are waiting.

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,110
Here you go.

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Enjoy.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,990
Miss Du Xinyue,

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,190
this is a letter
from Young Master for you.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Alright.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,750
What does Chen want again?

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,860
(I'm leaving.)

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Hey, I'll go with you.

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

62
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,710
Chen Xi, Caiyan.

63
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,990
Xinyue,

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,270
why are you here?

65
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,270
What are you doing?

66
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,750
We are leaving.

67
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,950
Xinyue,

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,340
Earlier,

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,230
I went too far.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,190
It's okay, Caiyan.

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,990
At the critical moment,

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,830
you came out to protect us, didn't you?

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,990
Chen Xi,

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,550
why are you leaving so suddenly?

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,870
Did something happen?

77
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,550
My father is being transferred
from Luocheng,

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,070
so we have to leave too.

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm sorry, Xinyue.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,230
Please be happy in the future.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,710
Thank you, Chen Xi.

82
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,070
Take care.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,150
You too, take care.

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,150
Treat her well.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,550
Otherwise, I won't let you go

86
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
no matter where you hide.

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Let's go.

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
Let's go.

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,390
A storm is coming, Su.

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,150
I will protect your reputation,

91
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,990
but you still have to pay the taxes.

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,070
Go back and think it over.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,910
I will come to find you again.

94
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Father,

95
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,830
what do you think?

96
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,190
Xinyue, what do you think?

97
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,670
Then I'll prepare the wedding.

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Alright.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,350
Isn't it too much trouble?

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,390
Don't worry,
you don't have to do anything.

101
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,750
Just keep running the tavern.

102
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,230
I'll take care of everything.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,110
