00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,400
Luo Wanqing.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,110
You said you could
capture Red Fox alive.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,910
How did you end up
being held hostage by him?

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,550
Red Fox is insidious and cunning.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Enough.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,950
You have

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,910
both the skills
and a sober mind

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,310
Why do you have to go against me?

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,510
I have no intention of opposing you.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,390
Still saying you don't?

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,590
You ruined so much of my goods.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,710
Do you know
how much money I've lost?

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,990
Your goods?

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,550
All the opium in Luocheng

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,910
is distributed by me.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,510
Without my permission,

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,190
who dares to sell it privately?

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,910
The law explicitly prohibits opium.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,230
Why can you sell it?

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,870
Why can't I?

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,630
What's wrong with me
selling non-smoking drugs?

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,270
Have you ever thought about
where these drugs come from?

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,830
Do you really think
you can make any difference?

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,310
So it was you.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,630
You are the one who killed my father!

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
Your father?

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,670
Who was your father again?

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,070
Oh, right.

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,910
A nobody

33
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,750
who threatened

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,830
to expose me.

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
Am I right?

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,310
Ridiculous.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,190
You wretch!

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,550
For your own selfish gain,

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,710
you've harmed so many innocent people.

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,390
And you all.

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,830
You are aiding the wicked.

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,750
Do you want to see your own families

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,950
harmed by opium?

44
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,190
I originally wanted
to take you under my wing.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,590
Didn't expect you
to spread lies even at death's door.

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,680
Everyone, listen to my order!

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,000
Prepare.

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Marshal.

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Take Xinyue away.

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,600
What about you, Young Master?

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,350
I have my own way.

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
Take her away.

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,630
No, I can't leave you here.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,640
Who dares to leave?

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,630
All you want is my life.

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Let them go.

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,470
Let's settle this between us.

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,550
If you want to die together,
that's fine too.

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,870
Three common people
for one marshal.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,030
Think about who gains and who loses.

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,790
Xingluo.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,910
- Go.
- Xingluo.

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,990
Go!

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,070
I dare anyone to leave!

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,630
Su Xingluo.

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,030
Xinyue, listen to me.

67
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,990
I'm begging you.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,110
Leave with me.

69
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,230
- Please, leave with me.
- Listen to me. Don't worry.

70
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,070
I will definitely burn
all these bad things.

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,410
Go, go.

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
- I'm begging you!
- Go!

73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,670
Leave with me!

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,580
Su Xingluo!

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,510
Su Xingluo!

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,850
Come on.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,260
Let's leave together.

78
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,110
Let's leave together.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,420
Su Xingluo!

80
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,180
- Young Master!
- Su Xingluo!

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,950
Young Lady.

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Father.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,670
Li, why didn't you keep an eye on him?

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,470
Did you kill Du Xinyue's father?

85
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,350
- Get him out of here.
- Did you do it or not?

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,670
What exactly did you do
on that night five years ago?

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Leave me alone.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,510
Say something.

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,550
I never thought my father

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,230
would be such a heartless person.

91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,990
He's a murderer.

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,110
Li, take him down and watch him.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,150
If he escapes again, I'll kill you!

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes.

95
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,340
(Zhang's Shop)

96
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,070
Xinyue, you're awake.

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,190
It's okay, don't be afraid.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,830
Everyone knows you're not Red Fox.

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,190
You were wronged.

100
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,910
What are you talking about?

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,110
The newspaper said
you were Red Fox.

102
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,510
They wanted to arrest you.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
But it's all right now.

104
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,830
Everyone knows you're not.

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,430
Those police officers
were just talking nonsense.

106
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,510
They insisted on arresting you.

107
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,550
But it's okay now, don't be afraid.

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,070
Don't worry, don't worry.

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,790
How could it be you?

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,030
We are together every day.

111
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,270
Finally, justice has been served.

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,910
Attention, everyone.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,710
The vicious Red Fox
has plagued Luocheng for many years.

114
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,230
But today, we have finally
brought him to justice.

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,110
This serves as a warning to all of you.

116
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,070
Xinyue, let's go.

117
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,910
This corpse is quite frightening.

118
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
However,

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,910
we still have an important matter.

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,910
In order to kill this traitor,

121
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,150
Marshal Zhang

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,990
sacrificed his life.

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,390
But everyone, rest assured.

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,830
Marshal Guo

125
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,510
will definitely give you a better life.

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,900
(Xingyue Tavern)

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,710
Ma'am, where's my dish?

128
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,740
Ma'am, where's my dish?

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,070
Coming right up.

130
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,420
Sorry about that.

131
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,270
Sorry about that.

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,190
Seems like she's been possessed
since she came back.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,710
When will Young Master Su return

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,430
from his business
in another province?

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,430
You need to eat something,
or you'll get worse.

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,350
I can't face Xinyue anymore.

137
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,670
Let's leave here.

138
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
Alright.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,430
Wherever you go, I'll be with you.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
But,

141
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,910
before we leave,

142
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,790
I want to see Xinyue one last time.

143
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,140
Xinyue?

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,150
Xinyue.

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,630
What's wrong?

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,230
