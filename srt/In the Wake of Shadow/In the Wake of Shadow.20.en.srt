=Episode 20=

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,870
Isn't this Young Master Su?

4
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,270
Ah, no, no, no.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,350
I should correct myself.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,030
Su Xingluo.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
Hurry up and leave.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,320
This place

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,150
is no longer your home.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,150
Now it belongs to Marshal Guo.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,200
Sir, sir,

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,390
let us take one last look.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,110
After all, we won't be coming back.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,280
If you want to look,

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,990
do it quickly.

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,750
I'm still waiting
to drink with the courtesans.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,510
Young Master, Young Master.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,030
You haven't slept all night.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,950
The mansion has been confiscated,

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,710
but at least
we still have another residence.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,430
He might give us a few more days.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,270
Let's go back and rest,

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,550
or you'll run yourself ragged.

24
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,460
(Sealed by Luocheng Government)

25
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,380
(Xingyue Tavern)

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,350
You're back, Xinyue.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,510
What should we do now?

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,270
Ever since Marshal Guo came to power,

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,550
he's been imposing various fees.

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,450
How can the common people
afford to eat and drink?

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Oh, right.

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,150
Two opium dealers
came to see me this morning.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,710
They said they could
supply us with goods.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,150
I drove them away immediately.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,110
What was bound to happen
has finally happened.

36
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,390
Xinyue, about Father's matter...

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,950
I'll think about it.

38
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,900
Young Master,

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,750
how do you think we can save Master?

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,550
If Red Fox and Green Tail
were still around,

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,910
we might have a chance.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,390
I don't mean anything by it,

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,670
please don't...

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't worry.

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,390
I won't do anything stupid.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,990
(What if Red Fox reappears?)

47
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,820
(Xingyue Tavern)

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,750
Who could it be so late?

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,510
You still have the nerve to come here?

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,630
I need to talk to her.

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,550
Could you please let her know?

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,910
I'll just say a few words and leave.

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,510
There's nothing to talk about.

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,590
Yao, let him in.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,630
Who let you in?

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,520
Yao,

57
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,230
you wait outside.

58
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,190
I came today to tell you

59
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,550
I will definitely
give you an explanation.

60
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Explanation?

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,110
Explanation for what?

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,470
Are you going to pay with someone's life

63
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,510
or trade your life for my father's?

64
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,750
Su Xingluo, can I still trust you now?

65
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,630
If that works, then I'm willing

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,430
to trade my life.

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,790
I'm returning

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,830
this to you.

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,270
After all, we were husband and wife.

70
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,030
From today on,

71
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,710
let's pretend we never knew each other.

72
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,990
