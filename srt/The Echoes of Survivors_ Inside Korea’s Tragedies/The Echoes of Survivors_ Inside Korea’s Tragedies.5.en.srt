1
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,308
All the windows in my house are covered.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,228
I've put blackout curtains on all of them.

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,440
Unless I open the curtains,

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,359
I can't tell if it's raining or snowing.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,246
I stayed home most of the time.
I was out for less than ten days in total.

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,084
I think they call my condition

7
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,962
post-traumatic stress disorder?

8
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,384
And more recently, I've shown

9
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,428
defensive aggression.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,101
By the headboard of my bed,

11
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,478
I keep a 60-cm knife.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,564
This is something
I can quickly grab and swing

13
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,191
if there's an intruder.

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,986
I have an awl
and a bunch of other knives too.

15
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,074
You just stab them in the side,
right where the lungs are.

16
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,701
Right under the ribs.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,246
When I wear my parka in the winter,

18
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,958
I keep an awl or a knife this big in it.

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,338
I hold it in my right hand,
tucked inside my pocket.

20
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,887
You know,
I've come close to death several times.

21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,812
To be honest, I was desperate to survive.

22
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,832
It was past midnight.

23
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,920
After wrapping up a stakeout,

24
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,672
we were just waiting at the light.

25
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,173
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

26
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,175
My pager buzzed. It was the station.

27
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,510
I had a guy get out of the car...

28
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,929
KO BYUNG-CHEON
LEAD DETECTIVE OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

29
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,014
...and head into the office.

30
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,476
When I arrived,
the senior officer at the desk said,

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,103
"Hey, just who I needed. Get over here."

32
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,938
OH HU-GEUN
DETECTIVE ON THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

33
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,023
So I asked him what was happening.

34
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,068
He said the complainant, Ms. Lee,

35
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,823
was high, talking nonsense,
and told me to take her away quickly.

36
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,160
He thought she was on meth.

37
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,955
Her statement was so wild
that it sounded like fiction.

38
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:49,209
She was talking about the murder.

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,045
But the whole story was hard to believe.

40
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,132
Not even a movie would go that far.

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,049
How could anyone...

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,677
She kept talking about chopping up bodies,

43
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,722
shooting people to death,

44
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,058
dismemberment, and burning the bodies.

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,061
So I asked her,
"Did you take any drugs or something?"

46
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,857
I even rolled up her sleeves
to check her arms.

47
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,526
I examined her closely,

48
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,361
but it didn't seem like she was on drugs.

49
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,447
Later on,

50
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,992
she confessed and said she shot someone.

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,455
She said she fired the gun,
after pressing it against their head.

52
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,374
I pointed the barrel...

53
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,752
LEE HYO-JIN
LAST SURVIVOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

54
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,380
It was probably right around here.

55
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,426
My finger was back on the trigger.

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,474
I pressed my finger,

57
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,185
and then...

58
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:02,491
<i>A six-member criminal gang,
equipped with a hideout and incinerator,</i>

59
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,911
<i>has been arrested for five murders
across the country.</i>

60
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,956
<i>All suspects are in their early twenties.</i>

61
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:13,043
<i>With the goal of extorting one billion won
from the wealthy,</i>

62
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,339
<i>they carried out a series
of indiscriminate kidnappings and murders.</i>

63
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,552
Stop pushing!

64
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,181
Is it true that you ate human flesh?

65
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,267
It was just me.

66
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,852
I said I'm not a human.

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,230
- Why did you do it?
- To give up my humanity.

68
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,190
Stand him up straight.

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,609
I'm not human.

70
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,528
I regret not killing
everyone who deserves to die.

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,364
That I couldn't kill them all.

72
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,621
There were no stairs,
just a ladder set up.

73
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,541
When we climbed down...

74
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,628
the scene in the basement
was beyond imagination.

75
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,756
PARK RAE-YONG
REPORTER, COVERED THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

76
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,717
There was a furnace in the corner.

77
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,137
A huge one, made of concrete.

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,601
They essentially used it
as a furnace for disposing of bodies.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,354
We didn't see much at first.

80
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,190
There was nothing but ash.

81
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,611
I grabbed the stick.
I think it's called a fire poker.

82
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,532
I dug around with it
and felt something rattling inside.

83
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,077
There were two skulls rolling inside.

84
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,711
It was pretty disturbing.

85
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,923
In my 30 years as a detective,
I'd never seen anything like that.

86
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:47,179
I was with the others
when I went down there,

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,601
but it still made my hair stand on end
and sent a chill down my spine.

88
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,272
It felt like I was on the set
of a horror movie.

89
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,363
It was truly beyond
what any human could ever imagine.

90
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,203
That place was like a murder factory.

91
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,873

GRUESOME MURDERS PROVOKE
FRESH ROUND OF KOREAN SOUL-SEARCHING

94
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,303
<i>This case was put to a stop when Ms. Lee,
who was kidnapped by the culprits,</i>

95
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,306
<i>managed a desperate escape,
narrowly avoiding death,</i>

96
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>and reported it to the police.</i>

97
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,986
It was either die there
or die trying to escape,

98
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,322
so I figured I might as well try.

99
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:51,994
That was how I tried
to make it up to the other victims.

100
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,790
She had gone through
some horrific things herself.

101
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,334
After a difficult escape,
she reported everything to the police.

102
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,336
KO NA-MU
FORMER REPORTER, CEO AT FACTSTORY

103
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,508
That simple fact left
a strong impression on me.

104
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,720
That place was like a murder factory

105
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,557
where so many lives were taken.

106
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,186
Just how did she survive all that
and make it out alive?

107
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,107
While I was in there,

108
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,070
I kept thinking, "Why me? Of all people?"

109
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,383
The only thing I did was try to survive.

110
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,219
I just wanted to live.

111
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,815
I AM A SURVIVOR
WHO TOOK A LIFE TO SAVE MY OWN

112
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,902
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

113
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,448
How have you been?

114
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,410
It's been about 30 years now.

115
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,581
I guess for everyone else,

116
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:47,628
you could say it's been 30 years.

117
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
But for me...

118
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,216
I mean, 30 years may have passed,

119
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,011
but to me, it still

120
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,973
feels like it was only a few days ago.

121
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,768
I feel like time stopped for me back then,
mentally and...

122
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,273
I'd like to forget about it.

123
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,445
I just wish I could forget and move on.

124
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,951
Every detail of what happened there
is still vivid in my mind.

125
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,705
Which is why, from time to time,

126
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,584
I feel like my mind is still stuck at 27.

127
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,170
It's 27 years old.

128
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,260
I was around 26 or 27 back then.

129
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,221
I had a part-time job.

130
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,643
I worked there for about a year.

131
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,317
I worked as a server at a restaurant

132
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,902
that served pork cutlets,

133
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,613
<i>sujebi, kalguksu,</i>

134
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,574
and dishes like <i>omurice.</i>

135
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,369
We served them for lunch.

136
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,668
Office workers from the area
would stop by for a beer at dinnertime.

137
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,547
That neighborhood had
a lot of office buildings.

138
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,053
At the time, live music was played

139
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:25,643
by so-called bandmasters who would travel
from place to place to perform.

140
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,061
So

141
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,356
we also had a bandmaster who was called in

142
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,692
every time a customer asked for music.

143
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,864
That was one of the reasons
I got to know him better.

144
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:45,121
He and Lee Hyo-jin were simply colleagues.

145
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,667
One day, after work,
the two colleagues went for a drive.

146
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,797
They drove out to Yangsu-ri.

147
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,844
We went for a drive
and to meet up with friends.

148
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,894
We crossed the Paldang Bridge.

149
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,230
That's as far as I remember.

150
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,608
I kept staring out the window,
despite there being nothing to see,

151
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,987
and suddenly, the car

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,073
came to an abrupt stop.

153
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,786
With a loud thud,
my head slammed into the dashboard.

154
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,791
I was like, "What the hell?"
and got really annoyed.

155
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,002
When I looked ahead,

156
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,922
I saw a car blocking the road,
right across the center line.

157
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,510
Then some men suddenly sprang out
and approached us.

158
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,764
The window was open just a little,

159
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,101
and someone fired a gas gun at me
through the window.

160
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,938
Then he reached in to punch me.

161
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,359
It was hard enough to bruise me.

162
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,156
I found out later

163
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,619
that the bandmaster had been stabbed.

164
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,746
In the thigh.

165
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,750
It was actually pretty close to Gangnam.

166
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,879
They were waiting there
for any rich people passing by.

167
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,094
So how do they immediately know
if their target is someone with money?

168
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,559
As the car goes by,
they check out the make and model.

169
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,397
The two victims were in a Grandeur V6.

170
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,904
At the time, if you drove a Grandeur,
it meant you had money.

171
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,738
So they kidnapped them.

172
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,699
They'd shoot gas at their victims,
threaten them with knives,

173
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,036
tie them up, blindfold them,

174
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,580
and throw them into their car.

175
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,459
When they tied me up
and threw me into the truck bed,

176
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,753
I realized...

177
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,758
"These guys are no petty thieves."

178
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,554
I imagined that they might chop me up,
burn me, bury me,

179
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,850
or just dump my body in the water.

180
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,105
And as their truck was rattling
down the road,

181
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,358
I found myself thinking,

182
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,236
"So this is how I die."

183
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,698
"I just hope they keep me in one piece

184
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,534
instead of chopping me up."

185
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,414
I think we were on the road
for a long time.

186
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,417
I fell asleep at one point.

187
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,587
I fell asleep in the vehicle.

188
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,552
But then
the truck suddenly stopped somewhere.

189
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,221
I heard a creak,
like some kind of gate was opening,

190
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,058
and then someone said,
"Hey, pull it into the garage."

191
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,522
With my eyes covered
and all my limbs tied,

192
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,984
someone picked me up and carried me.

193
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,866
And I think he carried me on his back
down the stairs like that.

194
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,539
I felt someone tap my face
and say, "Lift your head."

195
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,879
I tried not to look,
but before I knew it, I was looking up.

196
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,345
It only hit me
once my eyes were uncovered.

197
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,513
That place was...

198
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,809
It was like a prison.

199
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,980
There were steel bars and platforms
on either side of the cell.

200
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,652
That's when I gave up and thought,

201
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,364
"They are definitely going to kill us."

202
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,292
DAY 1 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 9, 1994

203
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,471
I'd been with the company about five years
and working harder than ever.

204
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,598
I'm from Gwangju,

205
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:19,228
and I was at my parents' place there
for the holidays.

206
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,024
But then I got a call from work.

207
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,278
A news team was heading
to Yeonggwang, Jeollanam-do.

208
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,741
I was told to join them
and supervise things on the ground.

209
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:44,086
The ridges of that hill
are still the same.

210
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,881
But that's all that remains.

211
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,383
Everything around it

212
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,302
has completely changed.

213
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:57,391
Now it's just a vacant lot
overgrown with weeds.

214
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,253
Cops came down from Seoul,
and the local police were there too.

215
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,007
Dozens of media outlets,
each with about three to four people.

216
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,636
TV networks, newspapers, and the locals.

217
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:41,309
Everyone had gathered around the house
they used as a hideout.

218
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,270
It was quite the commotion.

219
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,689
Totally chaotic.

220
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,782
This is the house in question.

221
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,077
They built themselves a hideout.

222
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,788
They painted it

223
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,041
pink and turquoise.

224
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,880
At first glance from the outside,
it actually looked really pretty.

225
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,928
The house itself is L-shaped.

226
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,473
This right here is the garage.

227
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,516
Behind this shutter

228
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,394
is where they took
the victims' vehicles apart.

229
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,609
There's a metal panel under the parked car

230
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,362
that covers the passage to the basement.

231
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,824
Behind the shutter lies
a secret underground passage.

232
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:42,788
This is where the Chijon Family committed
gruesome murders and mutilated bodies.

233
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,875
The first thing you see
when you climb down the ladder

234
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,920
is a holding cell.

235
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,840
With steel bars and everything.

236
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,017
It was basically like the holding cells
back at our station.

237
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,187
It was nearly identical to those cells.

238
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,022
We were also quite stunned.

239
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,941
You see...

240
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,278
that's what they did.

241
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,072
To the left of the entrance...

242
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,410
there was an incinerator in one corner.

243
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,247
They built a furnace with concrete,

244
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,500
kind of like a brazier.

245
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:35,966
It was essentially a furnace
where they burned bodies.

246
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,889
HIDEOUT

247
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,099
UNDERGROUND PASSAGE

248
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,393
UNDERGROUND PRISON

249
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,146
CELL WITH STEEL BARS

250
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,480
INCINERATOR

251
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,484
Just imagine being kidnapped

252
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,739
and dragged down to that place.

253
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,619
You know, the psychological...

254
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,372
terror,

255
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,626
it's probably beyond
anything you can imagine.

256
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,428
I was in nothing but despair.

257
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,557
It was impossible for me to think

258
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,518
that I could get out of there alive.

259
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,187
It wasn't just me.

260
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,858
Anyone who saw that place
would have thought the same.

261
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,570
I just gave up.

262
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,157
You know how just giving up
makes you feel at ease?

263
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,494
Struggling to survive
is actually much more painful.

264
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,413
After giving up like that,

265
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,458
I let out a dry laugh once more.

266
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,379
He swore at me, saying,
"What are you laughing about, bitch?"

267
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,966
Then he sat down
with the knife in his hand

268
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,345
and began jabbing at the cement floor.

269
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,853
Initially, they demanded 30 million won.

270
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,439
This is what they said.

271
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,528
"If you give us 30 million won each,
we'll let you walk out of here."

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,363
"We'll let you live."

273
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,161
So I said, "I don't have 30 million won."

274
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,708
The bandmaster said the same.

275
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,130
The bandmaster?

276
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,469
Honestly, he wasn't particularly well-off.

277
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,471
Basically,

278
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,893
what I'm saying is,
they picked the wrong targets.

279
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,439
They stopped an expensive car,
but the people in it had no money.

280
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,320
A musician driving
a seven-million-won secondhand car

281
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,447
with a part-time server.

282
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,374
I told them
my family didn't have that kind of money

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,003
or the means to come up
with such an amount.

284
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,007
And when they heard what I had to say...

285
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,928
they said, "Hey, this is a bust."

286
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,431
"These two don't have any money."

287
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,517
"There's no way they can get the money."

288
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,064
After that, they all just left.

289
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,608
Once they realized
they couldn't extort anything from me,

290
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,527
they left me alone in there,
locked the door,

291
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,155
and I heard all of them go upstairs.

292
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,952
And I think I just sat there,
crouched, and stayed like that.

293
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,751
They shut the door and left,
and after a while...

294
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,753
I think it was Moon Sang-rok?

295
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,510
- So you actually ate them?
- No.

296
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,429
MOON SANG-ROK
MEMBER OF THE CHIJON FAMILY

297
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,768
Moon Sang-rok was the first one
to come in.

298
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,150
He came in awkwardly
and just stared at me.

299
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,195
So I looked up at him and asked,

300
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,365
"What do you want?"

301
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,119
And he said, "To have sex with you."

302
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,170
At one point, I tried to kill myself there
by biting my tongue.

303
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,715
I just felt so sorry for myself.
I was miserable.

304
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,647
After that,
the one called Hyeon-yang came in.

305
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,734
Baek Byeong-ok was next.

306
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,990
After that, Kang Mun-seop.
Kang Dong-eun came in last.

307
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,124
I looked at myself,

308
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,377
and I was disgusted with myself.

309
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,672
Why? I didn't even try to resist.

310
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,009
I should've at least screamed, "No."

311
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,971
Not that any of it would have mattered.

312
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,772
Just a moment, please.

313
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,358
Do you have any alcohol here?

314
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,777
- Sorry?
- Do you have any alcohol?

315
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,535
I'm about to have a panic attack
just talking about it like this.

316
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:01,750
It's getting hard to breathe,
as if I'm back in that basement.

317
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,044
It feels like I've gone back there.

318
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:09,174
I can see people around me now,

319
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,551
but it's like you're those guys.

320
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,972
I keep seeing their faces on yours,

321
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,225
and it makes me queasy.

322
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,232
I just...

323
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,236
Can I get up for a second?

324
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:56,346
<i>The six gathered to form the Chijon Family
with Kim Gi-hwan as the leader.</i>

325
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,683
<i>Their doctrine states,
"Traitors must be killed."</i>

326
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,895
<i>"We must extort
a total of one billion won from the rich."</i>

327
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,565
<i>After strangling the victim
to death for practice,</i>

328
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,945
<i>the four of them, including Kang Dong-eun,
secretly buried the body in a mountain.</i>

329
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,034
<i>Okay, we're done here!</i>

330
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,873
<i>The gap between the haves
and the have-nots is too large.</i>

331
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,378
<i>And the wealthy look down on the poor.</i>

332
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,630
<i>The poor will be poor forever.</i>

333
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,842
<i>I regret not killing more people
like I wanted.</i>

334
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,013
<i>I failed to achieve my dream.</i>

335
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,641
BEGINNING OF THE TRAGEDY

336
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:47,647
THE START OF THE CHIJON FAMILY
JUNE 1993

337
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:55,071
The ringleader was playing poker
with Kang, who's from the same town,

338
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,324
and they started talking about
starting a gang.

339
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,243
He talked Kang Dong-eun into it.

340
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,872
Once he started talking money,
Kang was intrigued.

341
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,626
He said, "Hard work doesn't make you rich
in this corrupt world."

342
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,464
"So let's take from the arrogant rich
who flaunt their wealth."

343
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,851
I WENT TO PLAY POKER

344
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,186
THERE, KIM GI-HWAN SAID

345
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,897
"THIS WORLD IS UNFAIR.
LET'S TAKE FROM THE RICH ASSHOLES."

346
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,399
HE SUGGESTED WE KIDNAP PEOPLE
AND HOLD THEM FOR RANSOM

347
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,069
SO WE DECIDED TO SERVE HIM AS CHIJON
AND FOLLOW HIS PATH

348
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,364
They first met at a gambling den.

349
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,240
Kang Dong-eun
began reaching out to people,

350
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,453
like his acquaintances from prison

351
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,913
and so on and so on,
to make a group of seven.

352
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,498
KANG DONG-EUN, 22 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

353
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,709
MOON SANG-ROK, 23 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

354
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,336
KIM HYEON-YANG, 22 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

355
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,004
Their average age was 21 and a half.

356
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,714
BAEK BYEONG-OK, 20 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

357
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,467
They were from poor families
and could only find work in manual labor.

358
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,427
KANG MUN-SEOP, 20 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

359
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,137
SONG BONG-U, 18 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

360
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:05,308
So they decided to work together
to make one billion won.

361
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,813
Their plan was to murder and rob people
until they finally reached their goal.

362
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,067
KIM GI-HWAN, 26 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

363
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,070
THE CHIJON FAMILY DOCTRINE

364
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,072
1. WE LOATHE THE RICH

365
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,574
2. COMMIT CRIMES
UNTIL WE GATHER ONE BILLION WON

366
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,702
3. TRAITORS MUST BE
TRACKED DOWN AND KILLED

367
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,206
4. TRUST NO WOMAN
NOT EVEN YOUR OWN MOTHER

368
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,843
TRIAL MURDER
JULY 1993

369
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,560
Their first murder was unplanned.

370
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,563
They were hanging out after dinner.

371
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:56,442
Then they saw a woman walk by
and dragged her under the bridge.

372
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,027
They raped her there.

373
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,490
After they were done,
they didn't know what to do with her.

374
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:07,161
So they contacted their boss,
who was back at the hideout.

375
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,706
The leader came out there,
took his turn to rape her,

376
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,499
and said, "Watch carefully now."

377
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,543
"This is how you kill a person."

378
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,087
And then he strangled her.

379
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,966
Some people even climbed the trees.

380
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,765
<i>A reenactment of their first crime</i>

381
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,394
<i>took place in the mountains of Se-dong
in Yuseong-gu, Daejeon.</i>

382
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,858
<i>The victim is a Jane Doe in her twenties.</i>

383
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,530
<i>The police believe the body found today
decomposed too quickly</i>

384
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,657
<i>to have been buried a year ago.</i>

385
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,786
<i>They've sent the remains
to the National Forensic Service</i>

386
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,789
<i>for a more detailed examination.</i>

387
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,502
I guess they raped a young woman
who was passing by.

388
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,044
She saw their faces,

389
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,048
so they came to us
after raping her down at the bridge.

390
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,677
You said Kim Gi-hwan killed her.
What did he say when he killed her?

391
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,138
"This is how you kill a person."

392
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,390
Did it really serve as a trial run?

393
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,684
Yes, it did.

394
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,561
"This is how you kill a person."

395
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:19,567
He said this as he strangled her to death.
This makes everyone an accomplice, right?

396
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:26,114
Now everyone's thinking, "I'm a murderer."

397
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:31,162
That's how the boss kept them on a leash.

398
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,039
By making them accomplices.

399
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,750
- Now, step back.
- Okay.

400
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,504
- Hold on to it. Help them.
- Lay it down properly.

401
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,297
- Did it take over five minutes?
- Yes, I think so.

402
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,632
It took over five minutes?

403
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,884
And after that,
did you hear her last breath?

404
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,303
- I think we did.
- How?

405
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,263
- Did Gi-hwan touch her?
- Yes.

406
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,305
He said she was dead?

407
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,851
Then he said,
"This is how you kill a person"?

408
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,562
Psychologically, they all went through
a very difficult time.

409
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,605
Song Bong-u even ran away.

410
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:02,234
Song Bong-u was the first
to rape the woman,

411
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,281
and he felt so guilty that he thought,

412
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,117
"I can't do this anymore."

413
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,496
So he withdrew cash from their account

414
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:14,956
and ran off.

415
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,462
SONG BONG-U, 18 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

416
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,047
He was the youngest.

417
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,675
He betrayed them,

418
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,635
took their money,

419
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,263
and went into hiding.

420
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:36,727
They called him and said,
"Hey, let's go and eat some dog."

421
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,523
So he came back, thinking,
"They must have forgiven me."

422
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:49,490
ELIMINATING THE TRAITOR
AUGUST 1993

423
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,787
<i>They murdered and buried one of their own
in the mountain woods for betraying them.</i>

424
00:31:55,788 --> 00:32:00,417
<i>A year ago,
they invited Song Bong-u for dog soup,</i>

425
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,337
<i>murdered him, and buried him.</i>

426
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,464
So it's here?

427
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,424
Let's take a picture first.

428
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,802
Wait, so it's right here?

429
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,638
- Is it over here?
- Yes.

430
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,848
- To the right?
- Yes.

431
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,144
<i>The suspects, completely unfazed,</i>

432
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:23,149
<i>showed the investigators
the exact burial location and method.</i>

433
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,569
<i>They also provided detailed answers
about the incident.</i>

434
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,908
While the two of them were talking,
I suddenly hit him.

435
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,828
So you were sitting, talking,
and then Hyeon-yang hit him from behind?

436
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,746
What kind of rock?

437
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,208
- The one you buried down there?
- Yes.

438
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,630
Apparently, they tied him up

439
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,508
and took turns striking him
with a pickaxe.

440
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:54,514
That was their way of vowing
to take part in the gang's crimes.

441
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,017
He was still tied up when they buried him.

442
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,234
They dug a hole, placed the body inside,
and poured gasoline on it,

443
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,528
burning parts of him.

444
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,906
It ties back to their doctrine.

445
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,326
"Traitors must be tracked down
and killed."

446
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,036
The ringleader thought,

447
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:23,000
"We can't let this happen again."

448
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,670
So he made a decision.

449
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,549
Were any of the members disturbed by that?

450
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,968
Not at all.

451
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:37,180
Each one of them said
they were glad the kid was dead.

452
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,807
At least that's what they said.

453
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,103
They were too scared to run
or betray the group.

454
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,023
That's exactly what the ringleader wanted.

455
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,567
JUNE 1993
KIM GI-HWAN FORMS THE CHIJON FAMILY

456
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,321
A BAND OF SERIAL KILLERS WITH THE SOLE AIM
OF ROBBING AND KILLING THE RICH

457
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,323
JULY 1993
FIRST OFFENSE - TRIAL MURDER

458
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:59,078
RAPED, MURDERED, AND BURIED A WOMAN
WHO WAS A COMPLETE STRANGER

459
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,873
AUGUST 1993
SECOND OFFENSE - KILLING OF THE TRAITOR

460
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,544
ATTACKED, MURDERED, AND BURIED MEMBER
SONG BONG-U FOR BETRAYING THE GROUP

461
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,504
MAY 1994
SET UP HIDEOUT IN YEONGGWANG

462
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,092
MURDER FACTORY
WITH PRIVATE PRISON AND INCINERATOR

463
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,053
SEPTEMBER 9, 1994
THIRD OFFENSE

464
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,599
KIDNAPPED LEE HYO-JIN AND HER COLLEAGUE

465
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:30,401
DAY 2 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 10, 1994

466
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,826
It must have been
the day after I was kidnapped.

467
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,374
On September 10th, the first to come down

468
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,585
was Kim Hyeon-yang.

469
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,463
He came down and...

470
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,799
I'm not human.

471
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,759
I regret not killing
everyone who deserves to die.

472
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,470
That I couldn't kill them all.

473
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,598
At that point,

474
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:06,229
he said they hadn't decided
what to do with me.

475
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,108
He also told me

476
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:15,070
they were going to kill
the man I was with later that day.

477
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,490
And they were going to make me do it.

478
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,536
He said they'd kill me if I didn't obey.

479
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,790
So I said, "I can't do that."

480
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,710
He then said,
in a completely different voice,

481
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,921
"You have to be strong."

482
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,925
"If you cry and show weakness
just because you're a woman,

483
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,592
you will die."

484
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,972
He emphasized that over and over again.

485
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:49,021
So why did they spare Ms. Lee?

486
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,567
Of the Chijon Family,

487
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:57,612
Kim Hyeon-yang was the only one
who said they should let her live.

488
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:02,367
The others said they should kill her,
following their doctrine,

489
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,620
as it was the rule they had set.

490
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,541
But Kim Hyeon-yang vouched for her,

491
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:13,129
insisting they needed a woman

492
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,298
to continue their crimes.

493
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,759
I got the impression

494
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,930
that Kim Hyeon-yang had
a soft spot for her.

495
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,101
Each of them raped her.

496
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,770
All five of them.

497
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,942
I don't know if Kim Hyeon-yang's feelings
for her were sympathy or love,

498
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,195
but he must have trusted her.

499
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,655
Because he had affection for her.

500
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,666
Later that night,

501
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,504
he yelled, "Come out, Hyo-jin!"

502
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,090
He did so in a harsh, commanding tone.

503
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,425
So I went outside.

504
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:05,097
They took me from my prison
to another room with steel bars.

505
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,725
The bandmaster

506
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:15,023
was so drunk that he didn't know
who was with him.

507
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,610
He was almost unconscious.

508
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,533
I was told to come up
to the platform where he was lying.

509
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:29,413
When I did, they told me to sit
and handed me a plastic bag.

510
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,832
Hyeon-yang lifted the bandmaster's head

511
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,001
and told me to put the bag on him.

512
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,798
I was crying, saying, "I can't."

513
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:45,596
Kim Hyeon-yang grabbed my hands,
placed the bag over his head,

514
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,890
and told me to press down.

515
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,142
I was pressing, but then I let go.

516
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:56,022
He put my hand back and said,
"Come on, you were doing so well."

517
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,234
And we both pressed down on him.

518
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:05,700
I could feel the bandmaster's warmth
in the palm of my hand.

519
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,619
I could feel it on my hand.

520
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:26,261
And they finally confirmed

521
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:30,433
that the bandmaster had passed away.

522
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,021
And then...

523
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,973
They killed him
when they found out he had no money.

524
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,352
They tried to disguise it
as a drunk-driving incident.

525
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,272
They placed him in a car

526
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,110
and pushed it off a cliff near Jangsu
to make it look like an accident.

527
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,156
This is them

528
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,492
pushing the car off the cliff

529
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,744
to drop the car into the valley.

530
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:38,209
Lee, the musician,
was in the driver's seat.

531
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,462
<i>This morning,
the Chijon Family demonstrated</i>

532
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,465
<i>how they transported the deceased Lee
in their truck,</i>

533
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,133
<i>placed him in the driver's seat,</i>

534
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,429
<i>and pushed the car off a cliff
to make it look like an accident.</i>

535
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,182
- So you just sat him down here.
- Yes.

536
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,435
- Had the body gone stiff at this point?
- Yes.

537
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,522
Without the seatbelt on?

538
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,276
His blood alcohol level led

539
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:09,531
the local authorities to rule his death
as a drunk-driving accident.

540
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:14,119
<i>Kim Gi-hwan, leader of the Chijon Family,
an unprecedented crime ring,</i>

541
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,208
<i>appears to have orchestrated
these murders from prison.</i>

542
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:24,045
<i>Hey! How am I guilty when Chun Doo-hwan
and Roh Tae-woo are innocent?</i>

543
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,465
<i>The laws in this country are fucked up!</i>

544
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:37,017
CHIJON
THE MASTERMIND BEHIND BARS

545
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,228
It was all about "Chijon."

546
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,231
"Chijon won't like this when they see it."

547
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,901
They were always talking about Chijon.

548
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:52,867
They said, "We have a leader,
and we call him Chijon."

549
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,121
"And we do everything he says."

550
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,001
They called him "Chijon,"
meaning "the King."

551
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,253
They said he excelled at everything.

552
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,965
He was good at cards, read a lot of books,

553
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,050
and so on.

SUSPECT INTERROGATION REPORT
SUSPECT: KIM HYEON-YANG

558
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,023
CHIJON RECRUITED ALL OF US
TO UNITE THIS FAMILY

559
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,941
EVERYTHING HE DID WAS VERY LEADER-LIKE

560
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,943
HE WAS LIKE THE GREAT LEADERS IN MOVIES

561
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,070
THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO CALL HIM CHIJON

562
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:35,284
The leader was in prison for rape.

563
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,831
He raped his friend's niece.
She was a minor.

564
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:48,338
Kang Dong-eun, as second-in-command,
would visit him for guidance.

565
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:54,177
Since they couldn't speak openly,
he used codes to give instructions.

566
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,805
That's how they planned all their crimes.

567
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,977
<i>Kim Hyeon-yang and the Chijon Family
visited Kim Gi-hwan</i>

568
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,440
<i>15 times during the month
he was incarcerated to plan their crimes.</i>

569
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,360
<i>That is how absolute
his influence over them was.</i>

570
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:15,698
You didn't commit any crimes
between last August and this September.

571
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,409
That was something we could do
only once the boss was back.

572
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,619
You mean Kim Gi-hwan?

573
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,120
KIM HYEON-YANG

574
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,916
We thought we could handle this one
on our own.

575
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,918
The leader was arrested,

576
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,088
yet the members still follow his orders?

577
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,215
Did they have such solidarity?

578
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,591
The solidarity was very strong.

579
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:38,263
For instance,
none of them could leave the gang.

580
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,640
They couldn't betray it.

581
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,480
Kim Gi-hwan, the ringleader,
would coerce the members

582
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,067
by saying, "You can run away if you want."

583
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,197
"I'll leave my chest exposed
while I sleep,

584
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,617
so you'd better stab and kill me
before you leave."

585
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,329
"Because if you don't,
I will find you and kill you."

586
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,625
It's no wonder
they were so terrified of him.

587
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,378
Kim Gi-hwan was the devil.

588
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,386
DAY 4 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 12, 1994

589
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:13,232
I took part in taking someone's life.

590
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,944
I didn't know the law well,

591
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,823
but I thought leaving like this

592
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,786
would make me a criminal too.

593
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,038
They told me

594
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,793
I'd have a better chance of surviving
if I did what I was told.

595
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,671
I took part to save myself.

596
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,256
They said they'd spare me.

597
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,636
They said she'd participated in the murder

598
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,013
and that there was no way out for her.

599
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,265
Others insisted they should kill her,

600
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,477
and Kim Hyeon-yang suggested doing so

601
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,356
right before the boss
was released from prison.

602
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,984
He said they should use her until then.

603
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,821
The others weren't happy about it.

604
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:04,118
They said they should at least cut off
a finger to make me one of them.

605
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:08,664
But at that point,
I wasn't afraid to lose a finger.

606
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:15,211
If giving up one of my fingers
was what kept me alive,

607
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,590
I thought,
"Yeah, whatever keeps me alive."

608
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,261
I got greedy
when they said they'd spare my life.

609
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,723
But then Kim Hyeon-yang told me

610
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,726
that he had told the boss
there was a woman.

611
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,396
And his boss told him
to take care of me before he got out.

612
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,317
Because they weren't to trust women,
not even their own mothers.

613
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:46,868
4. TRUST NO WOMAN
NOT EVEN YOUR OWN MOTHER

614
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,746
He said even he didn't know

615
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,875
what would happen to me
once the boss was out.

616
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,254
I thought my fate would be decided
once Chijon was out of prison.

617
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,883
Realizing that made me even more anxious.

618
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:07,723
I began to wonder,
"Is there a way out of this place?"

619
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,353
I think it was that day.

620
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,649
I asked them for paper and a pen.

621
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,817
Then I made a list.

622
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:24,281
I had them buy radishes, salted fish,
and frozen pollack at the market.

623
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:32,623
I made them pollack soup,
radish kimchi, and spicy stir-fried pork.

624
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,337
I was trying to show them
what I could do for them

625
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,299
and that they needed me.

626
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:53,227
DAY 5 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 13, 1994

627
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:10,369
The next morning, Kim Hyeon-yang came in
and told me they'd been talking about me.

628
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:17,000
They were heading out
and discussing whether to bring me along.

629
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,920
He said he wasn't so sure, so I spoke up.

630
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,298
"If you let me come along,
I might not be much help,

631
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,468
but I won't get in your way."

632
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,345
That's what I told him.

633
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,765
Wherever they were going,

634
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,103
I probably had a better chance
of escaping than in prison.

635
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,651
The rest of the gang
was already set to go.

636
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,903
When I came up,

637
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:50,742
I could see they were thinking,
"Why is she here?"

638
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,580
So Kim Hyeon-yang said,
"Didn't feel right to leave her here."

639
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,666
"Plus, if we have a woman with us,

640
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:03,505
it might be easier
to get through police checkpoints."

641
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,135
It was when they were putting me
in the car.

642
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,012
I think it was Moon Sang-rok.

643
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,348
He said, "Try anything funny
and I'll put you down right there."

644
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,020
Then he took out a big knife to show me.

645
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,654
I was told not to look out the window
and to keep my head down.

646
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:34,995
We'd been driving for a while when I saw
a road sign that read "East Seoul."

647
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:46,547
YEONGGWANG, JEOLLANAM-DO

648
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,882
EAST SEOUL

649
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,093
I wondered where we were going.

650
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,848
They drove into a shady area
where no one else was around.

651
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,853
They drove down a deserted road,

652
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,774
and I saw a sign
that said "South Seoul Memorial Park."

653
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,777
So I thought, "Why are we here?"

654
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,573
That's when it hit me.

655
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,952
"This is where they're going to kill me."

656
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,914
I started getting pretty nervous then.

657
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,588
We went a bit further up the road.

658
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,433
A Grandeur was parked

659
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,981
in front of the trail leading up the hill.

660
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,985
One of them said, "Find the passengers."

661
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,237
Then Baek Byeong-ok got off there,

662
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,241
I got off,
and Kim Hyeon-yang headed right up.

663
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:59,162
They searched the area and found

664
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,374
a couple cutting grass up there.

665
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,626
They got out and asked,

666
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,796
"Whose car is parked down there?
Is it yours?"

667
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,924
The man said, "Yes, it's mine."

668
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,976
He said, "That's a nice ride.
You cleaning up around the grave?"

669
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:26,106
When he approached them, the lady asked,
"What's going on? What do you want?"

670
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,817
And the gentleman actually caught on
very quickly.

671
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:35,072
He saw Kim Hyeon-yang pull out his knife
as he approached.

672
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,117
He yelled, "Honey, run!"

673
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,744
As he jumped down,

674
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:43,457
Kim Hyeon-yang grabbed his waist
and fell with him.

675
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:52,089
Not even five minutes later,
the couple was in the back of the truck,

676
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,425
just like I was.

00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,566
KIDNAPS COUPLE TIDYING GRAVE FOR CHUSEOK

681
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:27,959
DAY 6 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 14, 1994

682
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,342
The couple told them,

683
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:40,555
"We don't have any money.
We just started a small business."

684
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,849
"We came from nothing.
We're just starting to make a living."

685
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,145
They kept glancing at me
and making eye contact.

686
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,065
Kim Hyeon-yang told them,

687
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:56,737
"This lady isn't one of us.
She was kidnapped just like you."

688
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,031
"But we're still keeping her alive."

689
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:03,328
"So as long as you can get us money,
you can get out of here alive too."

690
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,999
"We want 100 million won."

691
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,462
"So if you can get us 100 million,
we'll let both of you live."

692
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,755
The man replied,

693
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:18,927
"The factory isn't doing well right now,
but I'll try to get the money."

694
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,138
That was a lot of money.

695
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,931
It's a huge sum.

696
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:29,479
Back then, 100 million was enough
to buy an apartment in Gangnam.

697
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,442
They told him to tell his company
he had been in a car accident

698
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,946
and needed them
to bring 100 million to settle.

699
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,991
When he called the company
and asked for 100 million,

700
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,786
they said
the most they could gather was 80.

701
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,913
When he told them he could get 80 million,

702
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,000
they were like, "80 million?"

703
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,837
"Sounds like that's all he's got.
Let's take it."

704
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,132
Then they asked him
to find out from the employee

705
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,802
what time he could make it to Gwangju

706
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,306
and if he could come to Gwangju Terminal.

707
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,021
DAY 7 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 15, 1994

708
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:21,322
So we arrived at the bus terminal.

709
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,033
It was pretty dark there.

710
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,789
There were a lot of cargo trucks
parked there.

711
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,458
I felt a huge conflict within me

712
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,171
as we were waiting for the employee
to bring the money.

713
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,258
I thought, "Should I hide?
They might not be able to find me

714
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,093
behind those huge wheels."

715
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,680
But I couldn't bring myself to do it

716
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,435
because they said they had men
all over Gwangju Terminal.

717
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:55,774
Apparently, they were looking at us
from everywhere through their scopes.

718
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,109
And I believed them.

719
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,449
That was my one chance,

720
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,328
but I'd been brainwashed to believe them.

721
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,041
A car arrived,

722
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:17,212
and a man got out.

723
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,883
He asked, "What's going on, sir?"

724
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,802
I heard him ask that.

725
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:28,889
The man replied,
"It's nothing. Just hand it over and go."

726
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,226
I didn't notice at the time,

727
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,728
but he had passed a note
as he received the money.

728
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,189
I heard he wrote "kidnapped" on it.

729
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,025
He told him,
"Don't tell anyone. It's nothing."

730
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,528
I think that's why

731
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,491
he couldn't go to the police right away.

732
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,081
<i>Had the couple's kidnapping been reported
to the police sooner,</i>

733
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,334
<i>they would have lived to see this day.</i>

734
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,378
<i>Most kidnappings remain unsolved</i>

735
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,132
<i>because citizens are reluctant
to report them.</i>

736
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,842
<i>In the case of the murdered couple,</i>

737
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,221
<i>the sales manager of Samjeong Machinery
didn't report it to the police</i>

738
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,099
<i>after handing over
the 80 million won ransom.</i>

739
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,477
<i>At first,
I went to report it to the police,</i>

740
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:18,231
<i>but I got another call from the boss.</i>

741
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,900
<i>He sounded very cheerful on the phone,</i>

742
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,986
<i>so I was pretty relieved.</i>

743
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,698
<i>Even though the kidnappers were present
at the scene of the handoff,</i>

744
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,909
<i>there was nothing that could be done.</i>

745
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:43,214
So that night, we came back
without running into any danger.

746
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,511
Kim Hyeon-yang got up first and said,
"Good work, boys."

747
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,807
"Look, this is 80 million."

748
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:58,437
"Imagine the trouble
we'd have to go through to make 80 million

749
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,356
by working our tails off."

750
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,692
They were chatting among themselves.

751
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,987
They told the man,
"It's all good now. Have a drink with us."

752
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:10,909
"After a good night's sleep,
you'll be back at your house tomorrow."

753
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,619
"So don't you worry."

754
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,331
Then the man laughed and replied,

755
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,334
"Okay, thank you so much."

756
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,921
And he had a few shots of soju.

757
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,759
They said, "Well done."

758
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,430
"Go stay with your wife while you wait."

759
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,516
That's what they told him.

760
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:40,229
But while they were drinking,
after sending the man back downstairs,

761
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,607
I became the point of contention.

762
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,568
They said, "Everything worked out well."

763
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,779
"Good work, Hyo-jin."

764
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,160
But then Moon Sang-rok suddenly yelled,
"We gotta kill this bitch too."

765
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,371
He suddenly mentioned me.

766
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,831
No.

767
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,877
So Dong-eun initiated the murder, and...

768
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:09,509
KIM HYEON-YANG, MOON SANG-ROK
CHIJON FAMILY MEMBERS

769
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:14,972
"Chijon told us to get rid of her
before he came back."

770
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,682
Then Kim Hyeon-yang said,

771
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:20,770
"We agreed to keep her alive.
We're men of our word, aren't we?"

772
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,481
"We should remain loyal to each other."

773
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:29,070
Moon Sang-rok said,
"You're crazy for this bitch, bastard."

774
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,864
"You've gone crazy for this bitch."

775
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:36,244
Then Kim Hyeon-yang yelled,
"What the hell did you say?"

776
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,540
Then they started swearing and fighting,
grabbing each other by the collar,

777
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:47,380
and Moon Sang-rok threw a bottle
with beer still in it.

778
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,893
It hit Kim Hyeon-yang,
and his head began to bleed.

779
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:07,483
At that moment,
I couldn't help but think it was all over.

780
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,153
The air in that room was just terrifying.

781
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,490
I thought,
"They are going to kill me today."

782
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:29,005
She thought,
"If I don't run away from here, I'll die."

783
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,927
I was most scared
of Kim Gi-hwan returning.

784
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,929
I was overwhelmed by the stress

785
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,517
of having to escape that place
before he was out of prison.

786
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,435
So...

787
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,396
Had she not survived,

788
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,526
they could have gone on
to kill 100 people.

789
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,864
I thought, "Should I hide out
in a pig pen? Or a barn?"

790
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,869
She crawled under the platform
and hid there until sunset.

791
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,622
Even after escaping,

792
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,833
I didn't feel completely free
from their grasp.

793
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,586
I thought if they searched for me
from town to town,

794
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,339
they could find me.

795
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,802
"But I want to live."

796
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,720
"I want to live."

797
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,313
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

798
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,609
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
