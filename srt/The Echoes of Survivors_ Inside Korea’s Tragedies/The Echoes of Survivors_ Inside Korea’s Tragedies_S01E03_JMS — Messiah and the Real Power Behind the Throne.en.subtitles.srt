00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,513
IN THE DOCUMENTARY
,

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,931
RELEASED ON MARCH 3, 2023,

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,559
MAPLE, A WOMAN FROM HONG KONG,
SAID THE FOLLOWING

4
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:24,232
People will have a lot to say about me
if I cry in front of the cameras.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,901
They'll say I'm putting on an act.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,279
I am not

7
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,115
afraid of dying.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,745
It would actually be better if someone

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,788
killed me.

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,418
SHE RISKS HER LIFE TO GIVE HER TESTIMONY

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,214
You've been following us since yesterday
from Incheon Airport. Who are you?

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,841
Who are you?

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,471
Who is it?

14
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,474
Who is it?

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,604
To be honest, I'm terrified.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,692
AND HE HAS TO STOP HER FROM TESTIFYING

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,320
Wow, you have such wide hips.

18
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,073
You have such wide hips, Soo-jeong.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,157
Did you come?

20
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,117
Did you come? Did you?

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,244
I think I came, like, 50 times.

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,746
Fifty times.

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,417
THE UGLY TRUTH BEHIND THE DIVINE MESSIAH
IS REVEALED

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,171
I love you, honey!

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,840
Have you heard of "picking a fruit"?

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,133
"Don't eat the pussy."

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,593
"Don't touch the dick."

28
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,554
He put his hand on my genitals
and started praying.

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,264
"The Lord is telling me to examine you."

30
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,308
There was a news broadcast
about a huge fire.

31
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,061
He said, "What a waste of pussies."

32
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,357
"This isn't a sexual crime.
You're merely receiving the love of God."

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,817
"You should be thankful."

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
Jeong Myeong-seok said
something like this.

35
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,530
"My goal is to rape 10,000 women."

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,284
INSIDERS FINALLY SPEAK UP

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,621
I was in the car that was following you.

38
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:08,002
I felt terrible after hearing
that things had gotten harder for Maple.

39
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,174
AND SOME STILL DEFEND THEIR LORD

40
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,760
What kind of police officer refuses
to open the door?

41
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,719
Open the door.

42
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,471
Why is no one talking? I'm here.

43
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,681
Please talk to me.

44
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,890
Protecting your own?

45
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,143
Did you defend the people?
Is Maple a criminal?

46
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,521
Why did you create a manual
for handling Maple's case?

47
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,160
SEOUL

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:46,666
SEOUL
NOVEMBER 2023

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,836
Hello?

50
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,755
Is this Mr. Jo?

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,090
Yes, that's me.

52
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,760
I thought a lot
about whether I should call you.

53
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,761
Right.

54
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,473
My job is to dig up information on people.

55
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,433
I see.

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,937
I recently had a client ask me
to look into you.

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,105
Okay.

58
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,402
So have you covered a story
about a cult recently?

59
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,320
Yes.

60
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:20,783
I felt we might be in danger
if we went any further.

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,826
I see.

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,579
I'm calling you instead to let you know.

63
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,040
Who were they,
and what did they ask you to find out?

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,958
They're no ordinary guys.

65
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,376
What's the name again?

66
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,377
Jeong Myeong-seok?

67
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,837
Yes, Jeong Myeong-seok.

68
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,796
Right.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,716
Well, would you like to meet
and talk in person?

70
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,800
Yeah, sure.

71
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,479
CHO HOON-RAE, PRIVATE DETECTIVE

72
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,024
I've received a couple of calls
since early November.

73
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,027
They sent me your phone number

74
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:01,282
and the lieutenant's number
at Chungnam Police.

75
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,660
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 800

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,787
PRODUCER JO SEONG-HYEON
MBC NETFLIX

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,830
LIEUTENANT CHO SO-HYEON
CHUNGNAM POLICE

78
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,673
Who exactly are these people?

79
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,300
One is a police officer,
and the other is a producer.

80
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,010
Yes, he's a producer.

81
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,804
What producer? A Netflix producer?

82
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,264
Don't they make movies?

83
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,183
-He works in investigative journalism.
-Investigative?

84
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,559
-Yes.
-What's that?

85
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,854
Things like tracking people down
and digging up dirt.

86
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,190
You must've done something wrong, sir.

87
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,817
No, not me.

88
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,278
He did something wrong,
so I need to look into it.

89
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,282
But then I found out Jeong Myeong-seok,

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,326
the cult leader
who committed sexual assault,

91
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,788
had all these followers
who had made the calls.

92
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,000
So I wasn't sure whether to take this job.

93
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,920
Here's the deposit they paid me
to take the job.

94
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,046
THAT'S FINE

95
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,590
TRANSACTION DATE: NOVEMBER 19, 2023
TOTAL AMOUNT: 8,000,000 WON

96
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,759
They sent me eight million won.

97
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,724
And after 27 years in this line of work,
having been through thick and thin,

98
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,517
I knew this job was trouble.

99
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,189
I had a feeling returning the money
wouldn't be the end of it.

100
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,152
So I looked you up, Mr. Jo.

101
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,613
I saw you were receiving
many death threats,

102
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,742
and bad people were looking into you,

103
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,952
so I figured you should be on guard.

104
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,417
I have two weapons for self-defense.

105
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,085
One is a collapsible baton,

106
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,962
and the other is a stun gun.

107
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,674
Whenever I got home late at night,

108
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,386
I carried the stun gun
and the baton with me.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,390
But I realized the danger was greater
this time around.

110
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,732
-What is it?
-There's a big black vehicle.

111
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,568
-It was in front of us, engine running.
-Right.

112
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,652
I see.

113
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,700
Hang on. It's stopped right there.

114
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,536
-They're over there.
-They're waiting.

115
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,121
Is that the same car you saw?

116
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,706
-And it's not moving?
-No.

117
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,003
They left as soon as they spotted us.

118
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,222
-There's another one behind us.
-Another one?

119
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,015
-Which one?
-The SUV.

120
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,689
Excuse me.

121
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,029
Excuse me. Could you open up?

122
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,657
Why do you keep following us?

123
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,283
Just talk to us.

124
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,245
Why are you following us?
You're tailing us now.

125
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,123
Aren't you tailing us?

126
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,624
If not, tell us.

127
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,878
Why are you following us?
Open up so we can talk.

128
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,262
In 1997,

129
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:14,267
I was a victim of an assault
that left me with 30 stitches on my face.

130
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,606
KIM DO-HYEONG AFTER THE ATTACK

131
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,317
Those bastards even came
to my wife's workplace

132
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,696
and left a note saying,
"We won't just sit and watch anymore."

133
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,116
They posted publicly online,

134
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,413
threatening to cut me
into hundreds of pieces with a knife.

135
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,625
"Even if we cut Kim Do-hyeong's penis
into hundreds of pieces,

136
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,252
we'd be innocent."

137
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,089
"Kim Do-hyeong, did you forget
what happened 20 years ago?"

138
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,223
OCTOBER 29, 2003
THE ASSAULT ON KIM DO-HYEONG'S FATHER

139
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:04,650
This is a smartwatch
the police gave me for my safety.

140
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,404
"Some even die for their God."

141
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,574
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE FIRST VERDICT
IN JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S TRIAL

142
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,493
"Who are you to stop me?"
It's my own body."

143
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,415
Some have become martyrs for God,
out of love.

144
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,047
They used their bodies
to achieve the greater good.

145
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,927
The scum, the evil, the wicked,

146
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,388
they will be thrown
into the eternal fires of hell.

147
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,519
And the righteous shall shine
as brightly as the sun.

148
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,983
The key evidence! The recordings!
They turned out to be fabricated!

149
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,779
Try him based on evidence!
Stop the biased media coverage!

150
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,113
Stop the biased media coverage!

151
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,116
AUGUST 20, 2023, RALLY AT CITY HALL
FOR A FAIR TRIAL FOR JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

152
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,454
If this message is conveyed incorrectly,
it could cause serious trouble.

153
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:04,001
Some might think, "I'll sacrifice myself,"
and then go through with it.

154
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,420
RALLY FOR A FAIR TRIAL
FOR PASTOR JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

155
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,049
That's why I think it should be disbanded.
Otherwise, this will never end.

156
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,639
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:

DAEJEON
DECEMBER 2023

159
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,539
Look at all those people.

160
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,959
Look at all these cultists.

161
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,378
They even brought speakers.

162
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,091
They are trying to find
Pastor Jeong guilty without any evidence…

163
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,594
1ST TRIAL VERDICT ANNOUNCEMENT
OF THE JEONG MYEONG-SEOK CASE

164
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,889
…based only on media stories
and the complainant's claim.

165
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,811
The pastor has been falsely accused
and is facing an unfair trial.

166
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,979
NO CLEAR EVIDENCE AT ALL!

167
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,649
By law,
Pastor Jeong Myeong-seok is not guilty!

168
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
He's not guilty!

169
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,863
As we drove past the courthouse,
I saw signs reading…

170
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,782
WE PLEAD FOR PASTOR JEONG'S INNOCENCE

171
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,908
STOP THE PUBLIC WITCH HUNT

172
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,452
…"Pastor Jeong was falsely accused.
The recording is fake."

173
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,038
Those people always bring up
the recording…

174
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,082
INVESTIGATE MBC AND NETFLIX
OVER FABRICATED CONTENT

175
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,544
…claiming it was fabricated
and edited to mislead.

176
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,130
A TRIAL BY PUBLIC OPINION WITHOUT EVIDENCE

177
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,508
HE HAS SUFFERED UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF IT

178
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,051
That infamous recording,

179
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,596
"Did you come? Did you?
I think I came, like, 50 times."

180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,183
JMS insists that the recording
is completely fabricated.

181
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,980
Their clever excuse was
that it was an AI-generated voice.

182
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,525
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 1
THE RECORDING IS OF AN AI-GENERATED VOICE

183
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,902
Then they said he had diarrhea 50 times

184
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,946
after drinking the spring water
at Wolmyeongdong.

185
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,072
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 2

186
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,032
50 BOUTS OF DIARRHEA
AFTER DRINKING SPRING WATER

187
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,993
They changed their story again,
claiming he urinated 50 times.

188
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,498
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 3
IT WASN'T DIARRHEA. HE URINATED 50 TIMES

189
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,294
Urinating 50 times would land you
in the ICU or ER from dehydration.

190
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,927
First of all…

191
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,350
MAPLE
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

192
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,106
I've actually

193
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,695
regretted appearing in the documentary
In the Name of God.

194
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,577
I wore a mask everywhere for a while,
in case someone recognized me.

195
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,957
I never thought
that acknowledging the abuse

196
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,793
and speaking about it to people…

197
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,426
would lead to so much criticism and hate.

198
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,682
"She joined a cult

199
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,851
because she was stupid."

200
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,853
Or they'd say,

201
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,191
"She just went on Netflix
to become famous."

202
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,571
People say I sued Jeong Myeong-seok
because Professor Kim Do-hyeong paid me.

203
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,033
Or that I'm crazy.

204
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,996
Or that there are issues
with my sexual orientation.

205
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,540
Or that I'm Satan,

206
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,544
betraying God and selling out the Lord
for my own gain, like Judas.

207
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,671
SHE'S AKIN TO JUDAS ISCARIOT
WHO BETRAYED JESUS!

208
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,475
I can handle it
if I'm the only one struggling.

209
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,144
Then I could just hold it all in…

210
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,942
and everything would be okay.

211
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,655
But I feel so bad
about the pain I've caused my family.

212
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,241
For how I affected

213
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,619
their lives.

214
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,315
EXODUS
GREAT ESCAPE

215
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
I'm…

216
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,840
32 years old.

217
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,717
C
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,053
I was converted at 18

219
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,181
and left the church at 30.

220
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,895
Have you watched In the Name of God?

221
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,812
Yes.

222
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,610
I saw it as soon as it was released.

223
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,821
You know how it starts
with Jeong Myeong-seok's voice?

224
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,699
Did you come? Did you?

225
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,036
Did you squirt?

226
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,247
I think I came, like, 50 times.

227
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,749
Fifty times.

228
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,842
When I heard that,
my heart started racing.

229
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,761
It just felt so strange.

230
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
It sounded like he was talking to me.

231
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,226
Because I knew exactly what was going on.

232
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,981
For one thing, he said things like,
"Did you squirt?" a lot.

233
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:48,030
While touching me down here,
he said, "This is a pleasure spot."

234
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:52,117
Then he would say, "You are delicious,"

235
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,994
comparing me to ripe fruit.

236
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,168
WOLMYEONGDONG, JMS HEADQUARTERS
GEUMSAN, CHUNGCHEONGNAM-DO

237
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,589
There's a house with a red roof
behind Wolmyeongdong.

238
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:15,808
He told me
it had very clean mountain water.

239
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,560
He said he went there every day
to wash up.

240
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,615
He told me to follow him inside.

241
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,410
When I did,
Jeong Myeong-seok locked the door.

242
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,208
Then his eyes suddenly went wild,

243
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,836
and he climbed on top of me
like an animal.

244
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,009
While he was doing it,
he kept asking, "Do you like that?"

245
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,597
He bit my breasts so hard…

246
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,852
that they were bleeding afterward.

247
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,835
B
SECOND-GENERATION JMS MEMBER

248
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,255
EXPERIENCED FIRST SEXUAL VIOLENCE
AT AGE 14

249
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:45,064
As soon as I started watching it
on Netflix,

250
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,024
I was really shocked.

251
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,859
I cried a lot.

252
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,321
I think I cried a lot.

253
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,534
It brought back forgotten memories

254
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,288
of what I went through as a child.

255
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,748
Every night,

256
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,712
I had dreams of Jeong Myeong-seok
and Jeong Jo-eun chasing me.

257
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,549
And…

258
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,430
I constantly felt like I wanted to die.

259
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,025
I was first assaulted
in my second year of middle school.

260
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,779
The older girls called me over,
dressed me in a school uniform,

261
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,739
and sent me into the room.

262
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,827
So I went in and met the leader.

263
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,246
Since it was so late at night,

264
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,164
I spent the night there

265
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,168
and went to school on time in the morning.

266
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,297
I went to the bathroom

267
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,095
and noticed blood on my underwear.

268
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,641
But my head had been filled
from a young age

269
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:08,856
with the idea that Jeong Myeong-seok
was God, the Messiah, and all that,

270
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:14,528
so it never occurred to me
that what he'd done was wrong.

271
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,241
Did your parents know their daughter
was being sent to his room that day?

272
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,750
Yes, they did.

273
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,799
I think my mom knowingly

274
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,302
sent me there.

275
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,019
What he did was so perverted.

276
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,441
If he actually loved me,
he wouldn't have done that.

277
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,985
It was just so disgusting.

278
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,910
Almost everything Maple said
during her interviews

279
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,580
made me feel like I was in her shoes.

280
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,499
As a victim myself…

281
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,001
H
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

282
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,046
…I knew exactly
what Maple was talking about.

283
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,718
JMS once used to be everything to Maple.

284
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,766
The fact she had the courage to speak up
despite all the shame is incredible.

285
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,644
PRESS CONFERENCE OF THE VICTIMS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY JMS LEADER

286
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,232
There's absolutely no way
Jeong Myeong-seok is the Messiah.

287
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,778
And JMS is not a place
that is fulfilling God's will.

288
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,909
I was grateful to her
for taking the initiative like that.

289
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,746
That's why I sued Jeong Myeong-seok.

290
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,211
After I appeared in Season 1,

291
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,590
21 other victims stepped up

292
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,427
and joined the lawsuit.

293
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,184
Twenty-one people like me came forward.

294
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,376
This is the house with the red roof

295
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,587
where Maple and the other victims
were assaulted.

296
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,299
It's in ruins.

297
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,259
Divine justice.

298
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,974
While investigating
JMS leader Jeong Myeong-seok,

299
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,019
who was arrested
for sexually abusing female followers,

300
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,814
the prosecution and police
carried out a raid on the organization.

301
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,694
We managed to secure all kinds of evidence
from that search and seizure.

302
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,406
Among those were handwritten letters
from Jeong Myeong-seok.

303
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,286
These are letters Jeong Myeong-seok wrote

304
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,788
to the outside world,

305
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,542
which were obtained
during the search and seizure.

306
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,212
Do I have to read this out loud?

307
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,135
"Let's recruit the prettiest bitches."

308
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,476
He didn't say "prettiest girls."
He said "prettiest bitches."

309
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,104
"How sweet and arousing your tongue is."

310
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,483
"Your kisses should be analyzed."

311
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,778
"Let's do it, tender pussy."

312
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,447
EVIDENCE RECORD VOLUME 10 PAGE 5,969
LETTER FROM JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

"Push it deep inside."

314
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,868
"You have to reach the end
to feel it completely. 100%."

315
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,995
(BESIDE A DRAWING
OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MIDDLE FINGER)

316
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,457
"Or you'll never feel it."
He wrote things like this in the letters.

317
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
He's just a sick person

318
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,131
whose head is completely filled with sex.

319
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,551
That's all he thinks about,
24 hours a day.

10 DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE
OF "IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL"

331
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,268
And now they ask me.
"Did you really not know?"

332
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,687
JMS LEADERSHIP MEETING
CHURCH OF JEONG JO-EUN, 2ND-IN-COMMAND

333
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,063
I had a vague idea.

334
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,276
I pleaded with Pastor Jeong
for three and a half years.

335
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,153
I cried every single day.

336
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,905
I told him this wasn't God's will.

337
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,408
That there was no way it could be.

338
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,455
I prayed every day,
fearing this would bring down Providence.

339
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,252
I said everything I could
and did my best to stop him at all costs.

340
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:31,011
I tried to keep women from coming
within three meters of Pastor Jeong.

341
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,558
I don't know where those tears came from.

342
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,729
She's a real natural at theatrics.

343
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,277
H, FORMER FOLLOWER
FORMER JMS ATTENDANT

344
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,113
I thought this was my chance
to spread the truth.

345
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,574
I agreed to the interview

346
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,871
to share my experience
and reveal the truth about Jeong Jo-eun.

347
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,332
I felt I had to…

348
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,502
W, APPEARED IN SEASON 1
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

349
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,378
…expose Jeong Jo-eun.

350
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,464
Expose her true nature.

351
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,800
And the things she has done
outside the country.

352
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,260
That's why I'm here.

353
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,139
There's nothing holy
about that evil bitch.

354
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,270
AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 2018
HIS CONCERT AS JOSHUA JEONG

355
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,690
Thank you for not only composing,
writing, directing, and singing,

356
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,778
but also delivering
such divine conducting in tonight's show.

357
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:39,621
I warmly welcome you
to the Joshua Jeong concert, If I Do It,

358
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,542
featuring the world's greatest composer
and singer.

359
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,266
SYMBOLIC FIGURE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
JEONG JO-EUN

360
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:05,438
SYDNEY
SUMMER 2024

AMY, APPEARED IN SEASON 1, AUSTRALIAN
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

362
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,009
JEONG JO-EUN, AMY

363
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,829
I rarely give out this award.

364
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,207
The Faithful Follower of Love Award.

365
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,961
So she will have a new name.

366
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,422
Her name is…

367
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,633
Yes.

368
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,343
She'll have a new name.

369
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,178
Her new name is Jeong Hawwah.

370
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,430
Yes.

371
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,058
She was a messenger of God there.

372
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,436
If Jeong Myeong-seok was the Lord,

373
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,065
then Jeong Jo-eun
was truly like the Holy Spirit.

374
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,650
N
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

375
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:17,696
The Holy Spirit took me in one hand
and Jo-eun in the other

376
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,949
and then brought his hands together
while holding ours.

377
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,036
That's how Jo-eun came to be.

378
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,663
Masterpiece of a Lifetime.

379
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,748
Jeong Jo-eun was the symbol of JMS.

380
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,792
A TRUE MASTERPIECE OF A LIFETIME!
APPLAUSE, PLEASE!

381
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,922
She was the symbol, standard,
and role model set by Jeong Myeong-seok.

382
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,466
"Everyone has to be like Jo-eun."

383
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,636
"I hope everyone can follow
Jo-eun's example."

384
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,099
In 1999,

385
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,937
Jeong Myeong-seok first fled overseas.

386
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,313
In December 2005…

387
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,024
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S VILLA IN CHINA
DURING HIS FLIGHT

388
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,277
…just before Christmas,

389
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,989
I visited his villa in Qianshan, China.

390
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,452
To tell you a bit about Christmas,

391
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,289
each department prepared for it,

392
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:14,502
since we were all expected
to give glory to God.

393
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,684
It turned out Jeong Jo-eun had prepared
something of her own too.

394
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,063
She apparently learned choreography
from an expert and practiced hard.

395
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,192
She even showed up in a flashy outfit.

396
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,444
Jeong Jo-eun took the stage,

397
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,655
dimmed the lights,
and put on a one-person show.

398
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,618
She climbed onto Jeong Myeong-seok,
who was sitting on the sofa,

399
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:51,247
and kept grinding on him,
dancing in a way that resembled sex.

400
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,258
How was it, Apostle Jo-eun?

401
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,928
He has never seen me dance.

402
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,139
She still has a lot to practice.

403
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,933
What did you think about my dance?

404
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,893
-It was good.
-Really?

405
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,899
I'm in that Christmas video too.

406
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,070
Before that night,
*** always sat beside the leader,

407
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,615
but now Jeong Jo-eun was next to him,

408
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,659
and *** was sitting on the floor.

409
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,872
That's when I realized

410
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,708
something had changed.

411
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,004
That was the moment
she seized all the power for herself.

412
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,344
There was an intercom in the girls' room.

413
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,138
You could use it to speak to Jo-eun.

414
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,640
Then she'd ask,

415
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,601
"Who wants to go tonight?"

416
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,855
She'd call to ask us.

417
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,861
We called it "overnight duty."

418
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,030
You had to spend the night with him.

419
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,910
In other words,
it means having intercourse.

420
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,704
Engaging in sexual acts.

421
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:19,210
Jeong Jo-eun managed
all the women's entries and exits.

422
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,340
She knew exactly
what happened to the girls

423
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,551
when they entered that room.

424
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:32,807
She was the one who gave vaginal tablets
to the girls afterward

425
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,768
when they experienced
swelling and inflammation down there.

426
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,857
I realized
that Jeong Jo-eun handpicked those

427
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:46,905
whom she could completely trust,
and then trained and educated them,

428
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,198
all for that exact purpose.

429
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,412
It was a cruel act, like tossing prey

430
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:58,917
into a locked room
with a sex-addicted old man.

431
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,632
God, Holy Spirit, Lord of the Eucharist.
I love you.

432
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,675
Please let me hold you.
Can I hold you now?

433
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,010
I'm burning up.

434
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:15,808
Offer every bit of your love
to the Holy Trinity.

435
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,726
Amen.

436
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,812
We must give our hearts, lives, and bodies

437
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,565
to love our husband,
the Holy Trinity, our Lord.

438
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,483
Amen.

439
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,319
Let's offer our carnal and romantic love
to the Holy Trinity.

440
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,779
-Do you believe?
-Amen.

441
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,325
I found out later

442
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:38,164
that nearly all the victims
had been abused in similar ways.

443
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,126
The girl who ordered me…

444
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,336
MAPLE
JEONG JO-EUN

445
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:48,967
…to stay by Pastor Jeong's side
and guard him.

446
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,096
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL
SEASON 1

447
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,430
We were near Wolmyeongdong

448
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,766
when I was asked
to come alone to Cheonggiwa.

449
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,812
When I went there, J was there too.

450
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,774
She told me,
"Soo-jeong, I need to go to Seoul today."

451
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,777
"You should sleep next to him."

452
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,613
"And tell me if anything happens."

453
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,037
That J is none other than Jeong Jo-eun.

454
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,874
Jeong Jo-eun is his biggest accomplice.

455
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,214
She selected girls
Jeong Myeong-seok would like

456
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,634
and placed them by his side.

457
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,223
And she kept the girls under control,

458
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,351
saying, "This isn't sexual harassment
or assault."

459
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,730
Or she'd say, "This is the Lord's love."

460
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,608
She kept reinforcing the idea to us.

461
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,657
Jeong Jo-eun was the one
who created the entire system.

462
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,251
FROM LAYPERSON TO SECOND-IN-COMMAND

463
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:11,883
THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO PROTECTED THE MESSIAH

464
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,350
1999
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FLEES OVERSEAS

465
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:29,108
After Jeong Myeong-seok fled overseas
for the first time in 1999,

466
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,778
while he was staying in Malaysia…

467
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,990
We're currently in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,

468
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,494
at a hotel swimming pool.

469
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,539
He told the members in Korea to come.

470
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,418
People were literally lining up
to get on the plane back then.

471
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,837
And Jeong Jo-eun was one of them.

472
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,134
WHEN JEONG JO-EUN JOINED JMS

473
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,345
As far as I know,
she was recruited by JMS in the '90s

474
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,055
while still in high school.

475
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,977
Jeong Jo-eun was a tall girl.
She was exactly Jeong Myeong-seok's type.

476
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,985
She was then sexually assaulted
by Jeong Myeong-seok

477
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,612
and somehow went on

478
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,949
to become an accomplice
in his spree of sexual offenses.

479
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,247
Jeong Myeong-seok
first fled the country in 1999,

480
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,917
and by 2003,
when he was arrested in Hong Kong,

481
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
Jeong Jo-eun was there with him.

482
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,797
Come out here.

483
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,133
-Come out.
-What's coming out?

484
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,050
Get out, asshole.

485
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,970
What are you doing?
Why are you filming this?

486
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,430
-Huh? You kicked me?
-Hey, no. It's fine.

487
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,517
Hey, why are you putting your hands on me?
Why, huh?

488
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,981
When Jeong Myeong-seok was arrested
at his hideout

489
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,318
and placed in the back
of a Hong Kong immigration microbus,

490
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,530
Jeong Jo-eun was also arrested
and put on the same bus.

491
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,535
On the bus, Jeong Jo-eun spotted
Exodus members through the window.

492
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,707
This is what Jeong Jo-eun did
when she saw the Exodus members.

493
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,011
She was taken to immigration
with Jeong Myeong-seok,

494
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,096
and in the office,

495
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,516
she reportedly screamed
at the top of her lungs in Korean.

496
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,978
"Arrest me too!"

497
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,691
The immigration staff
didn't even speak Korean.

498
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,945
So who do you think
Jeong Jo-eun was screaming in Korean for?

499
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,660
She single-handedly fought them all,
including their boss.

500
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,871
"I'll kill you. Don't kill the pastor."

501
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,623
"He was sent by God."

502
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,042
"He's my savior. How can you kill him?"

503
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,710
"I'm going to kill you too."

504
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,339
She fought them all. It was incredible.

505
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,801
From then on, Jeong Myeong-seok gave her
his full support,

506
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:06,098
and Jeong Jo-eun became known
within JMS as "Apostle."

507
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,145
When we were in China,

508
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,190
Jeong Myeong-seok sat
with Jeong Jo-eun beside him,

509
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,152
and the older girls
were crying on their knees.

510
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:25,076
"Jo-eun is not someone you can
just casually call by her name like that."

511
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,330
"She went through hard times with me."

512
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,959
"To disrespect her is to disrespect God."

513
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,419
That's what he said as he made us kneel.

514
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,173
After that,

515
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,426
we weren't allowed to call her by name
and had to call her "Apostle."

516
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,181
We had to call her "Apostle"
and report to her on our knees.

517
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,391
That's how it changed.

518
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,062
1999
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FLEES OVERSEAS

519
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,068
2009
FIRST TIME PUNISHED FOR SEX OFFENSE

520
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,947
The Supreme Court's Second Division
upheld…

521
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,240
APRIL 23, 2009

522
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,785
…the ten-year prison sentence
for Jeong Myeong-seok, leader of JMS,

523
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,247
who was convicted
of sexually assaulting female followers.

524
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,836
After Jeong's ten-year sentence
was confirmed,

525
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:20,589
Jeong Jo-eun rose to a higher status
as the Holy Spirit.

526
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,137
During the ten years
Jeong Myeong-seok was in prison,

527
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,930
she acted as his proxy

528
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:32,810
and effectively led
the entire JMS organization.

529
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,648
I pray that our God
is never crucified again.

530
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,444
Glory be to the Lord, and may he bring
the earth-shattering rapture

531
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,529
and life upon this world.

532
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:48,242
I pray this in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

533
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,618
-Amen.
-Amen.

534
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,205
She said that Jeong Myeong-seok
was innocent

535
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,708
and had been framed for the sex crimes.

536
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,877
As far as I could tell,

537
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,466
her tearful pleas seemed to grow
the congregation even further.

538
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,183
Jeong Jo-eun

539
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,227
taught us

540
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:20,399
that Jeong Myeong-seok was God,
the Messiah.

541
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,320
Just as Jesus made history
in a foreign land

542
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,031
and returned to Jerusalem,
the land of persecution,

543
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,908
to bear the cross,

544
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:35,456
Pastor Jeong also bore the cross
in Korea's capital region,

545
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,291
the Jerusalem of today.

546
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,214
Jeong Jo-eun said Jeong Myeong-seok went
to prison for crimes he didn't commit.

547
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,258
We were told he was on a mission in China…

548
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,760
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK IN DAEJEON PRISON

549
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:53,974
…got caught up in a misunderstanding,
ended up in prison in Korea,

550
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,268
and would be released soon.

551
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,860
THE HOLY SPIRIT ABOVE THE MESSIAH

552
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,405
Of all seven days,

553
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,909
Jeong Jo-eun visited Jeong Myeong-seok
every Monday.

554
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,665
Most of the time, she visited him alone.

555
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,044
And he would discuss everything
with Jeong Jo-eun.

556
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,130
F, JEONG JO-EUN'S FORMER DRIVER
FORMER JMS FOLLOWER

557
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:28,717
Jeong Jo-eun was the only person
who could tell him what he should do.

558
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,721
DECEMBER 2012, GATHERING
DURING JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S IMPRISONMENT

559
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,516
Pastor Jeong should have been here
with us today.

560
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,227
He prayed so much for us yesterday.

561
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,106
He prayed for this gathering
to be guided by the Holy Spirit,

562
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,774
as well as for all of Providence.

563
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,736
While he couldn't join us in person,
he is with us in spirit and with the Lord.

564
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,823
I believe he is with us
and will speak to us.

565
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:54,034
Of course, thanks and glory be
to the Holy Trinity and to God,

566
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,829
but I'd also like us
to applaud Pastor Jeong,

567
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,873
who has dedicated his life to us.

568
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,294
In any case,

569
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,630
if Pastor Jo-eun served
as Jeong Myeong-seok's closest proxy…

570
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,632
NAM JUN-GEUN
FORMER SECOND-GENERATION JMS MEMBER

571
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,594
…then being near her was essentially
being near Jeong Myeong-seok.

572
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,851
Everyone was eager to say hello to her.
I've actually been there myself.

573
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:24,315
I also waited in line just to be greeted
by her for a few seconds.

574
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,454
Jeong Jo-eun even said this herself.

575
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,540
"Every time I go on tour,

576
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,961
I make at least 100 million won a day."

577
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,634
On a good day,

578
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,846
she'd receive enough money envelopes
to fill a large shopping bag.

579
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:01,477
Some people brought
tens of millions of won in cash.

580
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,441
Jeong Jo-eun got her hands
on all sorts of luxury goods.

581
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,612
The department store even had
a personal salesperson for her.

582
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,740
Obviously, Chanel.

583
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,742
Dior.

584
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,578
Valentino.

585
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,038
VAL*NTINO DRESS
ABOUT 7 MILLION WON

586
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,206
Miu Miu.

587
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,750
MI* MIU TOP AND BOTTOM
ABOUT 5 MILLION WON

588
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,711
And brands selling fancy dresses,
like Giambattista Valli.

589
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,922
GI*MBATTISTA DRESS
ABOUT 5-10 MILLION WON

590
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,508
She'd buy whatever looked nice.

591
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,969
She'd buy whatever she liked.

592
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,973
I think she liked anything luxury brand.

593
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,474
TIFFA*Y & CO. BRACELET
12 MILLION WON

594
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,185
After Jeong Myeong-seok went to prison,

595
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,729
she went to the salon
for her hair and nails,

596
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,941
dressing up in expensive clothes
and carrying designer handbags.

597
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,238
She was trying to make herself an idol,
like a K-pop star.

598
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:01,495
She made music, danced,
and filmed music videos.

599
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,255
She put herself forward like a celebrity.

600
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,717
She filmed music videos
and played them during service breaks.

601
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,345
Just like BLACKPINK headlining Coachella,

602
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,848
she'd take the stage
at the end of the festival

603
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,518
and lead everyone
to dance with excitement.

604
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,271
Her tall frame gives her
a commanding presence.

605
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:32,067
I guess that's why
they started idolizing her.

606
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,363
2010
JEONG JO-EUN'S RENAISSANCE PERIOD

607
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,869
2018
"MESSIAH WITH ELECTRONIC ANKLETS" RELEASED

608
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,500
DAEJEON CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

609
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,337
At last, we will meet our Lord,
our beloved.

610
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,549
Our beloved Lord has returned to us,

611
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,926
both in spirit and in the flesh.

612
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,011
Amen!

613
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,812
We can see that the Lord
is as handsome and cool as ever.

614
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,066
Let's confess to him in one simple phrase.

615
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,693
"The Lord is so cool."

616
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,028
So cool.

617
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,157
From the grave

618
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,619
He rose

619
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,412
Having defeated Satan

620
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:30,000
Triumphant over death

621
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:36,840
The Lord rose from the dead

622
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,426
Her headache had come back.

623
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,304
Jeong Myeong-seok was likely to rape again
after his release,

624
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,473
which would pose a serious problem.

625
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,728
Naturally, Jeong Jo-eun probably preferred
having Jeong Myeong-seok in prison.

626
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,315
That way, she could do whatever she wanted
without anyone nagging her.

627
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,782
THE HOLY SPIRIT CONTROLS THE MESSIAH

628
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,452
I think everything
that happened to Jeong Myeong-seok

629
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:11,166
was orchestrated by Jeong Jo-eun
and the people she had planted around him.

630
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:18,424
They reported
Jeong Myeong-seok's every move.

631
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,176
"He's on the move after his meal."

632
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,387
"He fell asleep."

633
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,264
"He's meeting someone."

634
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,226
"Don't let Pastor Jeong meet so-and-so."

635
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,854
All of this was done over texts.

636
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,775
You can't meet Jeong Myeong-seok
without the attendants' permission.

637
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,112
Just as not everyone can meet a king,

638
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:44,533
you can't meet the Lord,
Pastor Jeong Myeong-seok, so easily.

639
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,410
You need to submit a request

640
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,203
and inform them in advance.

641
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,000
And these attendants
report back to Jeong Jo-eun.

642
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,629
In the end,
Jeong Jo-eun makes all the decisions.

643
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,763
Jeong Myeong-seok once said this to me.

644
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,933
"Jo-eun said
I could only do it with you girls."

645
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,687
"She told me to touch only the girls
she brought to me."

646
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,231
"I can't do it with anyone else."

647
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,821
I thought that senile old man
was spouting nonsense,

648
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,656
but it was true.

649
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,999
If the Holy Spirit
would kindly blow out the candles…

650
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,918
After we sing you "Happy Birthday."

651
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,044
-Why, I…
-Yes.

652
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,128
I'm so happy.

653
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,176
All right.
Shall we wrap up the event here?

654
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,887
I believe you'll be conducting
the next performance.

655
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,931
-Let me announce it.
-Sure.

656
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,186
The JMS organization can only continue

657
00:46:54,269 --> 00:47:00,025
if Jeong Myeong-seok
keeps leading Providence as the Messiah.

658
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:04,112
Without JMS, there is no Jeong Jo-eun.

659
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:10,160
To maintain her authority
and immense wealth,

660
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,539
she absolutely needed Jeong Myeong-seok.

661
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,585
The best way for her
to keep Jeong Myeong-seok under control

662
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,506
was probably to keep supplying girls.

663
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,927
Ultimately, Jeong Jo-eun was in control
of Jeong Myeong-seok.

664
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,181
I heard this
from Jeong Myeong-seok himself.

665
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,226
"You guys don't know
how Jo-eun treats me, do you?"

666
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,896
He said Jo-eun yelled at him.

667
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,191
"Listen to me. I'm the Holy Spirit."

668
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,445
Apparently, she actually said that
to Jeong Myeong-seok's face.

669
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,871
CUTTING OFF THE TAIL

670
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,248
JMS LEADER ARRESTED AGAIN AFTER 4 YEARS

671
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,624
AFTER 10 YEARS IN PRISON,

672
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,043
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
COMMITS SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAIN

673
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,046
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FACES
NEW SEXUAL ASSAULT LAWSUIT

674
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,633
SUED FOR REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE
OF INCAPACITATED PERSONS

675
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,803
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK SEX CRIMES
IN THE SPOTLIGHT

676
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,638
THE AFTERMATH OF "IN THE NAME OF GOD"

677
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,766
SEX CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN DESIGNATED
AS HIS WIVES AND "FAITH STARS"

678
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,479
Actually, the people in the documentary
aren't the only victims.

679
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,775
Two additional plaintiffs
are waiting to sue,

680
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,485
and one is a minor as well.

681
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,530
The follow-up season on Netflix
will focus on that girl.

682
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,658
We need to stop this or it's all over.

683
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,538
I said, "What do you want me to do?
I can't do anything."

684
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,708
"What more can I possibly do here?"

685
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,714
And Pastor Jeong said to me,

686
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,258
"I guess I'll admit to part of it."

687
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,930
Before a group of followers, she denied
involvement in Jeong's sex offenses.

688
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,848
KIM SI-ON, REPORTER
COVERED JEONG JO-EUN'S STORY

689
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,934
PHONE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN KIM SI-ON AND JEONG JO-EUN

690
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,727
-Sex crimes are already rampant here.
-Right.

691
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,104
This is an organization of sex crimes.

692
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,231
Once Pastor Jeong and I go down like this,

693
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,233
this whole organization will implode.

694
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,070
It's only a matter of time.

695
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,031
"It has nothing to do with me."

696
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:15,077
By saying,
"I wasn't involved in any of this,"

697
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,413
she was, in a way,
selling out Jeong Myeong-seok

698
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,624
to prove she knew nothing.

699
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,251
"Jeong Myeong-seok is guilty,
but I am not."

700
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,589
Do you know

701
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,301
which part of the victims' statements
broke my heart the most?

702
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,597
Some younger victims
didn't even realize they were victims.

703
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,392
They didn't know they were assaulted.

704
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,978
Why?
Because they were so young and innocent.

705
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,815
We can't hide this anymore.

706
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,026
This is unacceptable. It's really serious.

707
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,282
6 MONTHS BEFORE THE RELEASE
OF "IN THE NAME OF GOD"

708
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,077
CONVERSATION BETWEEN JEONG JO-EUN
AND AN UNDERAGE VICTIM

709
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,079
You must be shaken up.

710
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,498
To be honest, I was really worried.

711
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,875
FAITH STARS: THOSE WHO DO NOT GET MARRIED
AND SERVE THE LORD

712
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,712
I wondered whether being a Star
required offering myself to Pastor Jeong

713
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,131
physically as well, you know?

714
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,048
Right.

715
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,134
That made me concerned.

716
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,096
So I thought,
"I should ask Pastor Jo-eun about it."

717
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,683
Since you've spent time with him,
I wanted to ask you

718
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,144
so I could understand him better.

719
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,187
I don't want to see him in a sexual way.

720
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,274
I also thought
you could possibly misunderstand it.

721
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,277
I can tell you one thing for sure.

722
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,573
Pastor Jeong is definitely not someone
who would behave

723
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,992
with romantic intentions like other men.

724
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,036
I guess he was just doting on you.

725
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,329
I never asked him myself

726
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,875
because it didn't feel like a man
touching a woman

727
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,754
but more like him showing affection
and friendliness.

728
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,506
-He is adorable, isn't he?
-He is.

729
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,133
Pastor Jeong is so adorable.

730
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,219
How can he be like that?
That's why we love him.

731
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,979
HONG KONG
MAY 25, 2024

732
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,780
Hey, Maple.

733
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,411
-How have you been, Maple?
-Good.

734
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,496
Everything okay?

735
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,291
Were you surprised I showed up?

736
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,752
We need to talk,

737
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,963
but I didn't think it was something

738
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,925
to discuss over the phone or by text,

739
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,802
so I came on such short notice.

740
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:53,443
Jeong Myeong-seok's lawyers
have been asking the court

741
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,405
for a copy of the recording you made.

742
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,327
We told the court it would lead
to severe secondary victimization

743
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,205
and submitted our statement
on three separate occasions.

744
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,083
The prosecutor
also objected to it multiple times.

745
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,086
But a few days ago, without warning,

746
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,880
the court gave them
a copy of the entire thing.

747
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,859
PHONE CALL BETWEEN MAPLE
AND COURT OFFICIAL

748
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,569
If those people
get hold of that recording,

749
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,155
we don't know what they'll do with it.

750
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,118
There's no point in telling me.
You need to submit the papers.

751
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,329
Okay. I'll send it, then.

752
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,664
-But…
-Yes?

753
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,375
Please don't give them the copies

754
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,211
until you receive my papers.

755
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,799
No, you see, that's not for me to decide.

756
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,469
If you actually allow this,

757
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,265
I'll withdraw the suit.

758
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,851
I can't do this anymore.

759
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,352
This is too much for me.

760
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,237
I think it was
about an hour and a half long.

761
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:26,328
Only a small part of the long recording

762
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,164
was featured on Netflix.

763
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,000
And it's not even the worst part.

764
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,424
There are parts
that are far more vile and disgusting.

765
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,889
The recording I submitted
to the authorities

766
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,351
is like the clothes or underwear I wore
during the assault.

767
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,478
COURT

768
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,315
It's evidence that proves
what I went through.

769
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,320
Allowing them

770
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,907
to make a copy

771
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,450
is no different

772
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,205
from them showing everyone my underwear.

773
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,834
That's how it feels to me.

774
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,214
So they gave the copies

775
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,009
to all three of his lawyers.

776
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,764
Right now…

777
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,311
they're playing it in the lawyers' office
for the followers.

778
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,504
What do I…

779
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,090
what do I do now? I…

780
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,891
All this makes me feel ashamed
to be Korean.

781
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,069
How much more do I have to go through?

782
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,580
Of course, as her father, I was furious.

783
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,000
I was enraged.

784
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:42,756
I'm not just disappointed in the judge.

785
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,634
Korea needs to reexamine…

786
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,719
MAPLE'S FATHER

787
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,055
…its judicial system.

788
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:56,186
MAPLE'S AUNT

789
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:43,942
MAPLE'S COUSIN

790
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,378
I believe JMS followers are everywhere.

791
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,091
Officers in the army, navy, and air force,
the Board of Audit…

792
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,176
The Prosecution Service,
the NIS, the police…

793
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,513
We have confirmation
that individuals in these organizations

794
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,098
are protecting JMS.

795
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,395
We at Providence
have powerful organizations as well.

796
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,188
A team of lawyers.

797
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,608
Moreover, a group of police.

798
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,363
Law enforcement exists
to serve the people,

799
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,075
but protecting Jeong Myeong-seok
was the top priority for them.

800
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,370
Defending Jeong Myeong-seok to the end.

801
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,165
Mr. ***.

802
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,207
-Yes?
-Here.

803
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,335
Why did you lie and say you weren't ***?

804
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:45,920
Well?

805
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,547
Mr. ***.

806
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,840
Mr. Joo Su-ho!

807
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,217
-I'm not Joo Su-ho.
-You're Joo Su-ho, aren't you?

808
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,261
Who were you defending, Officer?

809
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,181
Did you defend the people?
Is Maple a criminal?

810
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,559
Why did you create a manual
for handling Maple's case?

811
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,228
Are you a JMS follower or not?

812
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,771
-I'm not.
-You're not?

813
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,902
You can't come in here. You can't…

814
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,498
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

815
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,792
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY
