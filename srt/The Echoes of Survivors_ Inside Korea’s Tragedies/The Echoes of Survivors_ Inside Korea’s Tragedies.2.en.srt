1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:10,676
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF CHILD ABUSE

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,779
I think it was around late March,
when I was 16.

4
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:38,204
After the evening roll call,
around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m.,

5
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,416
the guard would open the gate
with a ring of keys in hand.

6
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,502
BROTHERS' HOME
WOMEN'S PLATOON

7
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,756
He'd say, "So-and-so, step outside."

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,593
Mi-gyeong, Mi-suk, or Eun-hui,
for instance.

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,262
And when their names were called,

10
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,015
they'd go out.

11
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,144
When they did,

12
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,815
they'd sometimes come back
with cookies and snacks.

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,361
We'd all go crazy,
scrambling to split them

14
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,114
and grab our share.

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
But they were given

16
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,245
in exchange for nonconsensual sex.

17
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,505
We didn't know any better and just waited
for the older girls to return

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,175
so we could get some of those snacks
from them.

19
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,179
So around that time,

20
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,641
whenever the intercom rang,
we'd eagerly wait.

21
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,604
And at that point...

22
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,109
I didn't think it would happen to me.

23
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,904
I never thought
it would happen to me, but...

24
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,370
Well...

25
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:06,918
PARK SUN-I DURING HER INTERNMENT

26
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,300
The commander wanted to see me.

27
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,938
That was when I saw
the bed covered with a blanket.

28
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,694
He sat next to me, put his arm around me,

29
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,949
got friendly, and said,
"Hey there. You need anything?"

30
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,873
He twisted my arms like this.

31
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,832
And put them like this.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,043
Then he grabbed my arms like this.

33
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,545
Just like this.

34
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,423
And he laid me down on the blanket.

35
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,509
Then he...

36
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,565
He gave me some tangerines
to eat when I got back.

37
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,574
I don't even care
that it was my first time.

38
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,576
I'm...

39
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,662
a mother who abandoned her child.

40
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,748
I'm a sinner.

41
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,417
A mother who abandoned her child.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,840
BROTHERS' HOME

43
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,513
I went to the ob-gyn three times.

44
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,683
But I couldn't do it.

45
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,394
I couldn't muster the courage.

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,356
And the baby
was already wriggling inside me.

47
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,234
Who was the father?

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,735
The commander.

49
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,615
I gave birth at Jinju Medical Center.

50
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,700
On February 4th.

51
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,539
My mom...

52
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,669
put the baby up for adoption.

53
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,810
After what they did
to my body and my life,

54
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,773
I may still be walking,
but they might as well have killed me.

55
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,486
When people pass me,
I'm afraid they'll judge me and think,

56
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,614
"That woman gave birth to a child

57
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,534
and gave the baby up for adoption."

58
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,161
So I can't even bring myself
to talk about it anywhere.

59
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,456
And it's just so painful.

60
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,837
PARK SUN-I WAS HELD
AT THE BROTHERS' HOME FROM 1980 TO 1986.

61
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,755
SHE GAVE BIRTH AT 16 AFTER BEING RAPED.

62
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,092
SHE STILL CARRIES THE GUILT
OF GIVING UP HER CHILD.

63
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,804
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

64
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,023
How many years were you locked up for?

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,530
They took me away when I was 11

66
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,533
and didn't let me go until I was 18 or 19.

67
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,080
So it was about eight years.

68
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,713
I was there for a little more
than four years and six months.

69
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,095
I think I was there for about 11 years.

70
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,768
I was taken in when I was 11.

71
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,481
And I got out when I was 18.
My father came for me.

72
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,152
Sir, did you receive any education?

73
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,237
No, I didn't receive any in there.

74
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,324
What is your highest level
of formal education, sir?

75
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,784
None.

76
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,161
We all thought it was okay
not to get an education.

77
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,538
We didn't know any law.

78
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,292
We didn't know about compulsory education,
and we were locked up too.

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,504
I didn't go to school
while I was in there.

80
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,508
I just barely learned to read.

81
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,846
I struggle with calculations
when the numbers get too big.

82
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,225
I can't even hope to do
multiplication or division.

83
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,185
The director believed,

84
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:21,314
"If we give these little punks a break,
they'll try to run."

85
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,861
"Don't let them just sit around.
Put them to work."

86
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,240
A seven-year-old was put to work
doing manual labor.

87
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,118
We hardly ate,

88
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,496
yet they worked us to the bone.

89
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,623
We were on the verge of fainting,

90
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:43,004
working all day on empty stomachs
in the middle of summer.

91
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,135
We were always hungry.
They hardly fed us anything.

92
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,137
They'd give us meat soup,

93
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,931
but it was just oil floating around.

94
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,309
That stuff was just inedible.

95
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,396
There was hardly anything
you could actually call food.

96
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,565
They gave us barley rice,

97
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,903
but it was barely three spoonfuls' worth.

98
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,615
And the soup tasted like nothing more

99
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,700
than water used to rinse <i>doenjang.</i>

100
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,035
INMATES WAITING FOR SOY SOUP

101
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,998
Most of the side dishes
smelled like they were rotten.

102
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,375
Kimchi tasted like it had already spoiled.

103
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,878
Whenever they went to a farm,

104
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,673
it was always right after the cabbages
had been harvested.

105
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,386
Around then, you'd find leaves
and peels tossed out in the fields.

106
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,682
The farm owner was actually thankful
when someone cleaned it up.

107
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,937
They would collect those leaves,
and the farm owner asked,

108
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,899
"What on earth
do you need all of these for?"

109
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,862
So they told him,
"We have about 30 pigs on our farm."

110
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,990
"We're going to boil these up
for their food."

111
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,245
It's great when all the fish
get auctioned off,

112
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,375
but if they don't and sit for a few days,
the fish starts to spoil.

113
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,672
We'd get a call.

114
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,842
Then we'd bring the blue truck
to go pick up the mackerel.

115
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,888
You can smell it
as soon as you start loading them.

116
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,267
So when I first got there,

117
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,104
they boiled and served spoiled fish,
so I couldn't eat it.

118
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,149
I couldn't eat it.
I just couldn't. It was disgusting.

119
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,572
<i>The director and his family eat here too.</i>

120
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,367
<i>They are frying the fish they bought.</i>

121
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,828
<i>They buy flour, bake bread,</i>

122
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,707
<i>and serve it as snacks
once or twice a day.</i>

123
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:48,087
<i>"Is 20,000 won a month really enough
to cover the meal I'm eating right now?"</i>

124
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,380
Absolutely not.

125
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,299
PASSENGERS AT THE FINAL STOP

126
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,135
This video shows the exact opposite
of what really happened.

127
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,514
It was their strategy
to promote themselves to the public

128
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:03,351
by advertising that they served good food,

129
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,356
when, in truth, his meals
were cooked separately from ours.

130
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:12,694
<i>All income earned by residents working
in the facility is deposited into savings</i>

131
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,990
<i>to support their self-sufficiency
after discharge.</i>

132
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,701
<i>These are the bankbooks
for the residents' savings accounts.</i>

133
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>The total savings amount
is around 130 million won.</i>

134
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,958
I didn't receive
a single penny of that money.

135
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,045
As for the money,

136
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,129
I never saw a dime.

137
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,173
So who took all the money?

138
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,135
The director and his family took it all.

139
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,264
Park In-geun started fully exploiting us.

140
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,809
Park In-geun probably pocketed all of it.

141
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,732
PARK IN-GEUN'S KINGDOM

142
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,401
Director Park In-geun and his family

143
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,363
lived in private quarters
on the Brothers' Home property.

144
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,447
EMPLOYEE QUARTERS

145
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,658
The house is huge and spacious.

146
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,703
They had a ton of potted plants too.

147
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,955
It was two stories high

148
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,542
and built like a corridor-style apartment.

149
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,755
On the second floor lived Park In-geun...

150
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,756
PARK DU-SEON

151
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,009
...and the general secretary
of the Brothers' Home.

152
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,928
The pastor, Lim Young-soon,
lived on the first floor.

153
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,763
LIM YOUNG-SOON
PARK IN-GEUN'S BROTHER-IN-LAW

154
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:26,811
Living next door was Lim Eun-soon,
Park's youngest sister-in-law.

155
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,147
I did all the housework myself.

156
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,444
I looked after the child
and did their housework too.

157
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,448
Park In-geun, the director, liked the...

158
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,619
He liked <i>yukhoe,</i> the raw beef dish.

159
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,791
<i>Yukhoe</i> was always on the table
at every meal.

160
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,628
Whenever I saw
Director Park's son or daughter,

161
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,547
I felt really envious.

162
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
If I were his daughter,

163
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,887
I'd get to wear
pretty, comfortable clothes

164
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,514
and eat whatever I wanted.

165
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,934
Seeing that always made me jealous.

166
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,187
Park In-geun's wife
especially wore housedresses.

167
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,857
She'd have her hair up like this,

168
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,067
all nicely blow-dried,

169
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,529
standing next to her husband
in that dress.

170
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,369
His family wasn't much better.

171
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,289
They were scary,
swearing at me and everything.

172
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,208
They totally looked down on me.

173
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,963
You know Park Du-seon, right?
The general secretary of the asylum.

174
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,756
Park In-geun's son.

175
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,591
PARK DU-SEON, PARK IN-GEUN'S SECOND SON

176
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,426
Man, I could never forget that guy.

177
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,094
He made my life hell.

178
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,347
For instance, he'd make me sit
on the ledge by the flowerbed.

179
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,225
He said he'd kill me if I caught it.

180
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,853
Then he threw a real baseball at me.

181
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,938
He threw it at my face
like a crazy bastard.

182
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,065
I'd just take it.

183
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,486
He'd beat a kid until he let it all out.

184
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,573
He kept hitting the kid's head
until it bled.

185
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,329
There was also a pastor
named Lim Young-soon at the church.

186
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,498
LIM YOUNG-SOON, PARK'S BROTHER-IN-LAW

187
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,375
Lim Young-soon was immediately
next in line after Park In-geun.

188
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,961
He was second-in-command.

189
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,130
PARK IN-GEUN, LIM YOUNG-SOON

190
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,341
At the Brothers' Home,

191
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,594
we were forced to attend worship services.

192
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:29,849
He never hesitated to use brutal violence
and punished the children severely.

193
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,686
And this was actual physical punishment.

194
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,816
Were you ever beaten
by Lim Young-soon too?

195
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,026
He slapped me in the face.

196
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,529
When I was baptized
by Pastor Lim Young-soon,

197
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,867
he'd spit on people if their feet had
a skin disease or athlete's foot.

198
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,913
History will judge them.

199
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,834
And rightly so.

200
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,506
BROTHERS' HOME EXPOSED

201
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,846
Around October or November of '86,
Prosecutor Kim Yong-won,

202
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,390
recently assigned to the Ulsan branch
of the District Office...

203
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,809
YEO JUN-MIN, FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL
OF BROTHERS' HOME CASE TASK FORCE

204
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,438
...went pheasant hunting over the weekend.

205
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,068
And he stumbled upon a bizarre sight.

206
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,366
The villager guiding the pheasant hunt

207
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,493
said those people
were from the Brothers' Home

208
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,453
and added

209
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,166
that they were being prevented
from running away.

210
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,256
So they were taking people in,

211
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,593
forcing them to work,
and not letting them escape?

212
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,803
That seems suspicious.

213
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:55,561
It all started when the investigation
into the forced labor began.

214
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,981
REPORTER HEO SANG-CHEON
COVERED ON-SITE AT BROTHERS' HOME

215
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,235
During the investigation, they realized
they had stumbled upon something major.

216
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,074
And since I was in Busan,
they said I should check out the scene.

217
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,412
That's where my coverage
of this case began.

218
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,833
BEWARE OF DOG

219
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,211
The first location I visited
was Banjeong Ranch in Ulsan.

220
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,755
BANJEONG RANCH

221
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,924
When I got closer to the scene,

222
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,928
I saw about seven or eight people
lying on the ground.

223
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,222
And their legs,

224
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
I mean, their ankles,

225
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:39,063
were tied up
with what looked like nylon rope.

226
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,152
"Why on earth are they tied up like that?"

227
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,365
I wrote about it right away.

228
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,660
184 RESIDENTS OF BUSAN WELFARE FACILITY
EXPLOITED FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT

229
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,872
DIRECTOR OF CITY-FUNDED WELFARE FACILITY
FORCED 184 RESIDENTS INTO LABOR,

230
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,166
BEAT ONE TO DEATH, AND BURIED THE BODY

231
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,169
<i>Seven defendants, including
the Brothers' Home director Park,</i>

232
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,047
<i>imprisoned residents, forced them to work,</i>

233
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,176
<i>and beat 40-year-old resident
Kim Gyeong-won to death.</i>

234
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,387
After the first report came out,

235
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,848
everyone realized how big this case was.

236
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,022
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

237
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,025
That's when the investigation picked up.

238
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,155
The following day, they visited
the main building of the Brothers' Home.

239
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,037
They brought in police officers
trained in martial arts

240
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,624
to carry out a raid on the facility.

241
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,631
When they entered the director's office,

242
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:54,221
the first thing they saw
was a large safe mounted on the wall.

243
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,267
Inside the safe,

244
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,061
they found US dollars, Japanese yen,

245
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,606
and other items like bearer bonds.

246
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,401
It was about two billion won in total.

247
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,155
Today, I think it'd be worth
tens of billions of won.

248
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,743
It was absurd
and truly beyond anyone's imagination.

249
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,620
Where would they have gotten
that money from?

250
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,791
He embezzled it from the residents.

251
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,380
How many people
would you say were kept in there?

252
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:33,259
As of 1986, there were about 3,200 people.

253
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,261
DETAINEE STATUS

254
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:41,101
At its peak,
up to 4,300 people were held there.

255
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,105
PARK MIN-SEONG
FORMER BUSAN CITY COUNCIL MEMBER

256
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,109
Considering the facility operated
from 1975 to 1987...

257
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,115
we estimate it held
about 38,000 people in total.

258
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,492
TOTAL NUMBER OF DETAINEES
38,000

259
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,577
It was probably for money.

260
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:04,208
Their funding was based on
the number of people they held.

261
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,587
The more people they brought in,
the more government subsidies they got.

262
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,549
The more, the better.
They wanted as many as possible.

263
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,720
I believe they received
up to two billion won...

264
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,138
1.7 BILLION IN '85

265
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,225
...in subsidies from the Korean government.

266
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,185
2.1 BILLION IN '86

267
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,812
They refused to cooperate with the police...

268
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,814
...Orders of Merit and Medals of Honor.

269
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,859
The Brothers' Home
must be shut down immediately.

270
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,697
He was arrested.

271
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,368
Park In-geun was arrested
in December of '86.

272
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:46,416
I thought, "Wow, finally,
the Brothers' Home is being shut down."

273
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:52,548
"That motherfucker Park In-geun.
He'd be put away for good, wouldn't he?"

274
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,926
<i>The Ulsan branch of Busan Office
requested a 15-year prison sentence</i>

275
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:01,180
<i>and a fine of 681.78 million won
for the defendant, Director Park In-geun.</i>

276
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,808
<i>Prosecutors stated
they were seeking a heavy sentence,</i>

277
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,979
<i>as Park's embezzlement
of government subsidies was unacceptable</i>

278
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,857
<i>in a welfare-based society.</i>

279
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:21,493
JUNE 30, 1987
BROTHERS' HOME SHUTS DOWN

280
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,169
I was released
when the Brothers' Home shut down.

281
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,591
My family was ruined.

282
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,677
We were struggling badly.

283
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:45,266
They'd been traveling all over the country
looking for us instead of working

284
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,728
and ended up spending all their money.

285
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,274
My mom said she tried to find me

286
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:57,070
by searching every single orphanage
across Korea.

287
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,824
As for my father,

288
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,618
he died of illness

289
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,204
after I was gone.

290
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,124
After that, the family fell into decline.

291
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,963
The entire family was shattered.

292
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,179
Things only got harder after I got out.

293
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,892
It was hard
because I couldn't live a normal life.

294
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,358
There was nothing... I could do.
Nothing at all.

295
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,986
The hostess bar was the only place
that welcomed me.

296
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,322
Because I was young.

297
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,367
It was humiliating,
and I didn't want to work there.

298
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,119
But I had no choice.

299
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,456
Getting out didn't end the misery.

300
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,959
I went to prison too.

301
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,337
I lived like a thug for a bit,

302
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,715
eventually ending up in Busan prison.

303
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,652
I tried to take my own life

304
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,906
three or four times at home.

305
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,120
For me, the pain of living

306
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,372
was too much to bear.

307
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,877
I thought it'd be better to just die
and not have to exist anymore.

308
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,429
I found out my little brother went through
the same things I did in there.

309
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,102
He attempted suicide a few times too.
He slit his wrist.

310
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,733
Eventually, on October 9, 2009,

311
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,527
I got a call from my nephew.

312
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:09,077
He was crying, saying,
"Uncle, Dad's trying to kill himself."

313
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:18,420
CHOI JAE-U

314
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,885
I felt deeply guilty.

315
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,349
I just...

316
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,396
miss my brother so much.

317
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,910
BROTHERS' HOME SHUTS DOWN
1987

318
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,872
ENCOUNTER WITH PARK IN-GEUN
1999

319
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,126
I think it was around '99.

320
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:04,508
I just happened to be coming out
of the bathhouse after a bath

321
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,260
when a very familiar face

322
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,597
caught my eye.

323
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,060
I walked toward him slowly
to get a better look...

324
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,897
and it was Park In-geun.

325
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,525
"That son of a bitch is alive?"

326
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,488
I got goosebumps all over at that moment.

327
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,409
I said to myself,
"Isn't that motherfucker Park In-geun?"

328
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,662
I opened my trunk,
grabbed the baseball bat...

329
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,249
and yelled,
"You son of a bitch! Park In-geun!"

330
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,001
as I ran toward him.

331
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,046
The bastard freaked out
as soon as he saw me,

332
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,176
got into his Volvo, and locked the doors.

333
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,178
I started hitting the car with the bat

334
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,141
while shouting,
"Open the door, you son of a bitch!"

335
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,313
But he was already in the car,
so he took off.

336
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,445
I thought, "I need to kill him."

337
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,737
"I'm going to kill that guy."

338
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,949
I thought he'd been sentenced
to life in prison.

339
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,077
I thought he'd be there for good.

340
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,458
He was sentenced to just two years
and six months in prison.

341
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,296
No further investigation was conducted

342
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,591
into the harm or human rights violations
suffered by the victims.

343
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:32,261
The investigation only focused

344
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,640
on Park In-geun's corruption
and embezzlement.

345
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,811
<i>But they never carried out
a proper investigation.</i>

346
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,274
<i>The prosecution openly pressured
investigators to halt the investigation.</i>

347
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:49,737
<i>Despite uncovering nearly 1.1 billion won
in embezzlement by Director Park,</i>

348
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,033
<i>there was persistent pressure
to understate the amount.</i>

349
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,784
Apparently, he was like an emperor there.

350
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,498
In there, he could do whatever he wanted
with the money he had.

351
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,668
Even in the detention center,
he still went to bathhouses or cafés.

352
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,338
PARK FREQUENTLY LEAVING THE PREMISES
DURING HIS TIME IN DETENTION

353
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,882
He was supposed to be behind bars,
but he came and went freely.

354
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,510
A WELFARE FACILITY DIRECTOR
ENJOYS OUTINGS WHILE IN DETENTION

355
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,304
Mayor Kim Ju-ho started a campaign
to secure his release.

356
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,306
CHUN DOO-HWAN, PRESIDENT
KIM JU-HO, MAYOR OF BUSAN

357
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,601
He held my hand
and said he didn't want this made public.

358
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,353
I assumed he was someone remarkable.

359
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,564
I thought the mayor of Busan
was the most powerful person in Busan.

360
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,275
So this guy was above the mayor.

361
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,488
AFTER 7 TRIALS, PARK GETS
2 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS IN PRISON

362
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,492
FOR EMBEZZLEMENT
AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE VIOLATIONS

363
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:50,257
Park In-geun, the director, died in 2016.

364
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,677
He died in a nursing home.

365
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,805
Back then, I thought,

366
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,682
"Couldn't he

367
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,017
at least have apologized

368
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,186
before he died?"

369
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,190
"That's the least you could do,
you piece of shit."

370
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,737
I'd have rather been the one

371
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,242
to kill Park In-geun back then.

372
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,745
I was in my mid-twenties then,

373
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,248
so I'd have been released by now.

374
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:33,258
A monster like him was going around
spending money like water.

375
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,930
AFTER HIS RELEASE, PARK IN-GEUN RAN
VARIOUS FOR-PROFIT AND WELFARE BUSINESSES

376
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,892
I heard that until the day he died,
he said,

377
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,687
"I did nothing wrong."

378
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,813
NEWSTAPA
MARCH 6, 2013

379
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,816
Hello. Are you Director Park In-geun?

380
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,109
Who are you with?

381
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,447
- I'm with Newstapa.
- Don't you see him right now?

382
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,116
Hey, what if he goes into shock
because of you, huh?

383
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,034
PARK IN-GEUN'S SON

384
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,494
What if he goes into shock?

385
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,038
You gonna take responsibility
if he collapses?

386
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,124
What have I ever done wrong, huh?

387
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,337
It's been over 20 years, you bastard.
Call your supervisor now.

388
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,214
Hey, tell me something.
Doesn't my father have any rights?

389
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,301
Doesn't he have any basic human rights?

390
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,929
Tell me. Does he not have any rights?

391
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,265
Please calm down.

392
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,310
JO SEONG-HYEON
DIRECTOR OF THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS

393
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,856
The interview you just saw was
the last time Park In-geun was on tape.

394
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,859
Here's one thing we should remember.

395
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,113
From the day he was released
to the day he died,

396
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:43,161
Park In-geun never once apologized
to the Brothers' Home victims.

397
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,999
Does his family still think the same way?

398
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,421
We went to great lengths

399
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:59,094
to finally get hold
of a member of Park In-geun's family.

400
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:13,566
PARK CHEON-GWANG, PARK'S YOUNGEST SON
CHAIRMAN OF THE BROTHERS' HOME FOUNDATION

401
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,652
Are you nervous?

402
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,738
Yes, very much so.

403
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,744
I know it wasn't easy for you
to agree to this interview.

404
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,956
What were you most worried about?

405
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,085
My biggest worry

406
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,461
would be my family.

407
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,047
What I worry about most

408
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,843
is the possibility
that my wife and children

409
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:45,724
might be threatened or put in danger.

410
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,685
Who do you think would harm your family?

411
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,812
The people

412
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,691
who would be upset with me
revealing the truth.

413
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,568
Especially those in the government,

414
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,987
the city of Busan,

415
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,742
and the police.

416
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,953
I don't think
they'd be very happy with this.

417
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,539
Given everything,

418
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,334
what made you decide to do this interview?

419
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:20,049
The reason I wanted to come
and speak with you

420
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,093
is to tell you

421
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,640
that Director Park In-geun
of Brothers' Home wasn't the only one

422
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,560
responsible for everything that happened.

423
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,815
I think my father was about 30% to blame

424
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,819
and the government about 70%.

425
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,238
That's what I believe.

426
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,032
PARK IN-GEUN

427
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,451
At the time, my father said

428
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,998
it was a direct order from the government,
issued by the president.

429
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,210
As far as I know,

430
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,838
President Chun Doo-hwan
even presented my father with a medal

431
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,966
and offered significant support.

432
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,471
Near Hwangnyeongsan Mountain in Busan,

433
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,932
there used to be

434
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,725
a presidential villa.

435
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,434
THE VILLA OF PRESIDENT CHUN DOO-HWAN

436
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,853
We went all the way there,

437
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,064
and I waited in the car
while my father went inside

438
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,817
to speak with the president.

439
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,655
He even got a watch from the president.

440
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,284
Once, while he was driving,

441
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,204
he was stopped by the police
for running a red light.

442
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:37,585
But once they saw the watch
from the president, they just let him go.

443
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,383
They gave him a medal
and made him do the work, but later,

444
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:48,470
when the president found him inconvenient,

445
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,473
he made my father take the fall.

446
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,643
Then why give him the medal?

447
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,188
It's pretty absurd, isn't it?

448
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,537
<i>Seoul has been chosen
to host the '88 Olympics.</i>

449
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,252
As citizens of the Olympic host nation

450
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,129
and as citizens

451
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,966
of a country emerging as a global player,

452
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,345
we must earn the trust and respect

453
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,057
of people around the world.

454
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,143
LET'S PURIFY OUR SURROUNDINGS
TO BUILD A BRIGHTER SOCIETY

455
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,771
After Seoul was confirmed
as the host of the '88 Olympics,

456
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,941
there was a push to clean up the streets.

457
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:47,947
To show foreigners that Korea
is a clean and developed country.

458
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,992
The poor, beggars, and street gum vendors.

459
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,746
They didn't want people like that
to be seen.

460
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,539
MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS DIRECTIVE NO. 410

461
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,125
They carried out a crackdown on vagrants

462
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:04,129
under Directive No. 410,
issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

463
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,590
DEFINITION OF A VAGRANT

464
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:11,011
I see it as a kind of human cleanup,
meant to remove citizens,

465
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:16,768
including the innocent and vulnerable,
from the streets.

466
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,939
Back then,

467
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:24,566
everyone loved Director Park In-geun.

468
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,068
VAGRANTS BEING SENT TO BROTHERS' HOME

469
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,363
Just one call was enough
to take care of them.

470
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,492
The program was a major success
in Busan at the time.

471
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,911
No other country
does it better than we do.

472
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:40,083
There's not a single beggar
on the streets.

473
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,128
Do you see any beggars in Korea?
Take a look. We have none.

474
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,423
There's an uproar over a single death
at the facility in Busan,

475
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:53,471
but in a developed country like the US,
that's barely an issue.

476
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,306
Not even an issue.

477
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,353
They found the record books documenting

478
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,357
when the police handed people over
to Brothers' Home.

479
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,569
The names of police officers,
civil servants,

480
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,239
and those who were captured were on them.

481
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,448
BROTHERS' HOME INTAKE FORM

482
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,537
They recorded when, where,
and how those people were captured.

483
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,835
Nearly 80% of them
were taken in by the police.

484
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:29,716
TOTAL DETAINEES IN '86: 3,975
REFERRED BY THE POLICE: 3,117

485
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,093
RATE OF DETAINEES REFERRED BY POLICE

486
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:37,055
1985: APPROXIMATELY 95%
1986: APPROXIMATELY 93%

487
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,932
What do the police do?

488
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,978
Even now,
the people I hate most are the police.

489
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,272
I want to kill him.

490
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,108
How could a police officer say
they'd take me home,

491
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,405
then take me to Brothers' Home instead?

492
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,034
I want to see his face one more time

493
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,411
if he's still alive.

494
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,127
MOON JEONG-SU, FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER
NEW KOREA DEMOCRATIC PARTY

495
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,421
Bringing an ordinary public order offender
to the station

496
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,966
only added a mere two points
to an officer's performance score.

497
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:18,722
However, turning in a beggar or vagrant
to the Brothers' Home...

498
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,723
PERFORMANCE SCORE

499
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,475
...earned them five points.

500
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,895
DETAINMENT, 2-3 POINTS
ADMISSION TO BROTHERS' HOME, 5 POINTS

501
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,856
One of the things
that motivated the police officers

502
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,235
to be more vigilant and active

503
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,406
was the bribes they received.

504
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,411
Whenever officers handed people over
to Brothers' Home,

505
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,040
the staff there slipped them some money.

506
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,341
At the time, police officers
frequently visited my father's office.

507
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,387
He sometimes handed them cash.

508
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,310
There was this team leader
at the Geumjeong police station.

509
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,648
I think my father gave him
around five million won as well.

510
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,901
Put simply, it was a bribe.

511
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,655
Were there any officers
who refused to take bribes?

512
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,533
I don't think I've seen any.

513
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,036
WHO IS BROTHERS' HOME DIRECTOR PARK,
A MEDALED MEMBER OF THE PUAC?

514
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,997
DIRECTOR OF BROTHERS' HOME
EMBEZZLES 1.1 BILLION WON

515
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:30,002
WHY HASN'T THE BROTHERS' HOME CORRUPTION
BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT?

516
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,215
What happened to your family
after your father was arrested

517
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,677
and Brothers' Home was closed?

518
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:46,852
After his release
following his arrest in '86,

519
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,149
my father decided
that we would immigrate to Australia

520
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,110
in 1990.

521
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,406
Our family's total assets

522
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,616
were once appraised at 36 billion won.

523
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,870
That was in 2011.

524
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:11,335
We owned a property in Australia
called the Milperra Sports Centre.

525
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:19,343
In Australia, they currently hold assets
worth about 14 billion won.

526
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,846
I believe his third daughter
and her husband

527
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:27,058
currently own the golf course
and sports center.

528
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,979
PARK'S THIRD DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND
CURRENT OWNERS OF THE GOLF COURSE

529
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:35,359
After planning our immigration
to Australia,

530
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,027
my father secured the funds...

531
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,779
EMPLOYEE OF VAGRANT FACILITY
IN WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES

532
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,657
...to buy the business in Milperra.

533
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,285
Even when Min Gyeong-u,
my third brother-in-law, ran it...

534
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,370
AUSTRALIA BUSINESS REPORTS
BROTHERS' HOME FOUNDATION

535
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,791
...he used to give my father daily updates
on revenue and expenses.

536
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,964
It clearly shows
that my father was the real owner.

537
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,093
The assets he siphoned off to Australia

538
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,095
were the assets of Brothers' Home.

539
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,514
To put it simply,
it's the proceeds of crime.

540
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,060
"This is what I inherited from my father."

541
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,021
"I have nothing to do with my father,
so I'll make good use of this money."

542
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,482
Do you find that acceptable?

543
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,901
His kids are living large now,

544
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,695
but it's blood-stained money.

545
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,448
"It was in the past,
but it was still wrong."

546
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,699
If they had just said that,

547
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,161
it would've been enough to ease our pain.

548
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,455
Now that Park In-geun is dead,

549
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,790
his kids should at least come out

550
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,209
and ask for forgiveness.

551
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,505
Who else are we supposed to get
an apology from?

552
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,425
Did we deserve this? We did nothing wrong.

553
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,845
Please, just apologize

554
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,556
so I can go on living.

555
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,601
I really don't want to live like this.

556
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,075
I came all the way from Busan
to Sydney, Australia.

557
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:15,001
It's been nearly 40 years
since I last saw Park In-geun's family.

558
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:22,716
NEW SOUTH WALES
AUSTRALIA

559
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:27,595
This is the driving range
and sports center

560
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,973
run by Park In-geun's daughter.

561
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,727
This is where their home is, right here.

562
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,905
Seriously.

563
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,991
I mean,

564
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:51,203
I can't believe
they're living such a happy life.

565
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,207
That boat's got to be worth
several hundred million won.

566
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,088
This property is currently valued
at over ten billion won.

567
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,551
"Are you happy living it up

568
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:10,431
with the money your father made
from killing people?"

569
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,308
"Are you people

570
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,936
willing to acknowledge it
and apologize at all?"

571
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,731
That's what I want to ask them.

572
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,940
Have you ever met Park In-geun?

573
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,276
LEE GI-BEOM, KOREAN-AUSTRALIAN
ACQUAINTANCE OF PARK IN-GEUN

574
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,528
Yes, we've met several times.

575
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,572
Back then,

576
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,325
there were a lot of thugs in Korea.

577
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:35,955
He himself said that he was good
at managing people like that.

578
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,584
What kind of place
did Park In-geun say Brothers' Home was?

579
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,295
A place of good deeds.

580
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,841
They are extremely wealthy.

581
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,720
It seems like the family was constantly
going back and forth to Korea,

582
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,847
engaging in things like that.

583
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:58,604
And every time Park Je-hui came back,
she always had new jewelry.

584
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,234
They're a happy family,
thanks to their wealth.

585
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,493
Wait, we should go that way.

586
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,755
Hello, I'm Jo Seong-hyeon,
a producer at MBC.

587
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,965
IN-LAW OF PARK IN-GEUN

588
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,758
- I'm from MBC in Korea.
- Okay.

589
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,928
Are Ms. Park Je-hui
and Mr. Min Gyeong-u at home?

590
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,221
They're in Korea now.

591
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,681
- Are you his father?
- Yes.

592
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,267
- I know what you're here to say.
- Right.

593
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,853
- But stop doing that. You see...
- Yes?

594
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,771
Why do you keep harassing people?

595
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,565
Sir, let me tell you this.

596
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,902
I'm a survivor of the Brothers' Home,
and while I was in there--

597
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,280
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No, please wait.

598
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,574
- Please hear me out.
- I'm not talking to you.

599
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,160
We're here because Ms. Park Je-hui
is Park In-geun's--

600
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,288
- No, just go.
- She's his daughter, right?

601
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,872
Just leave.

602
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,166
But, sir, do you at least admit

603
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,794
that this land, this golf course,
was purchased with Park In-geun's money?

604
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,591
No, that's not right.
You can request an investigation.

605
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,676
Don't we have rights as well?

606
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,096
What wrong have
Park Je-hui and Min Gyeong-u done?

607
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,266
I'm suing you, I swear.
There's a lawyer here too, okay?

608
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,270
Park Je-hui's daughter is also on her way
to becoming a lawyer.

609
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,521
You can't do this.

610
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,191
Do you know how painful this is?

611
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,568
I'm not just in pain.
I'm struggling to live.

612
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,653
Well, I have no reason to talk to you.

613
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,156
And, mister...
You say you're with a TV network?

614
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,657
But I'm the victim of--

615
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,409
- You're taking it too far.
- Sir.

616
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,537
What does it matter now
what Park In-geun did with his money?

617
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,958
It does matter, sir.
Even the Australian government--

618
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,593
HOME OF LIM YOUNG-SOON
FORMER BROTHERS' HOME PASTOR

619
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,680
Hello, is Pastor Lim Young-soon here?

620
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,181
No, he's not here.

621
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,017
- We know he is inside.
- He's not.

622
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,562
- Isn't this Pastor Lim Young-soon's home?
- No. It's not.

623
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,564
- It's not?
- No.

624
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:08,816
It isn't?

625
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,611
So Pastor Lim Young-soon
doesn't live here?

626
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,571
No, he doesn't.

627
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,539
That makes no sense. Let's have a look.

628
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,439
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

629
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,984
Could you take a quick look at this?

630
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,113
We checked with your next-door neighbor
and the register

631
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,574
and confirmed that he lives in this house.

632
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,076
- I see.
- Who is this person?

633
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,160
Isn't he your father?

634
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,412
Why are you here?

635
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,997
We had questions for your father,

636
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,000
so we tried to get in touch with him
from Korea as well.

637
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,251
You can't come in here.

638
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,420
- Okay, we won't go inside.
- You see, I...

639
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,966
I really wanted to meet
Pastor Lim Young-soon.

640
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,887
I was in the Brothers' Home
when I was young.

641
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,056
Can you tell me who this guy is?

642
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,516
It doesn't matter.

643
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,352
I have some unrelated questions
I'd like to ask.

644
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,479
Why did you say
Pastor Lim didn't live here?

645
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,107
- I don't care.
- That's none of your business.

646
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,193
- What's your name?
- No, hold on.

647
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,279
Then where is he? We want to talk to him.

648
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,864
It's none of your business!

649
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,992
You find him, if you want to find him.
It's none of our business.

650
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,828
Do you think
that he does not have any responsibility--

651
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,913
What has he done, sorry? What has he done?

652
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,082
- He is the victim.
- For what?

653
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,835
Why is he the victim?

654
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,170
I am a survivor of their abuse.

655
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,213
My brother died there,

656
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,507
and I was imprisoned
for five years as well.

657
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,093
Look at this. See this?

658
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,764
I was beaten so badly,
I lost all my teeth.

659
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,227
You don't have to say anything.

660
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,312
I was beaten when I was a kid.

661
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,814
You don't have to say anything.

662
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,482
I was beaten as a kid--

663
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,817
Bye. We've asked you guys
to leave our property.

664
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,737
Excuse me.

665
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,079
Come on.

666
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,792
Come on.

667
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,044
Let's go.

668
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,593
Wow, seriously.

669
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,056
This is infuriating.

670
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,923
I was telling them
about the abuse I endured.

671
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,428
I even took out my dentures to show them.

672
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,640
As human beings,
they should at least hear me out,

673
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,894
understand why it happened,
and know exactly what happened.

674
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:39,445
Who can I even talk to about the sorrow
of my brother's wrongful death

675
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,865
and the pain I've suffered my whole life?

676
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,036
That's what makes me feel
so devastated and resentful.

677
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,666
Goddamn it.

678
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,712
Damn it.

679
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,993
We can't enter that house anymore.

680
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,038
- We'll just stay like this.
- Yes, let's wait.

681
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,217
Excuse me.

682
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,219
PARK IN-GEUN'S NIECE
PARK IN-GEUN'S NEPHEW-IN-LAW

683
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,096
Can't we just talk for a moment?

684
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,599
Please?

685
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,810
Excuse me.

686
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,318
Excuse me.

687
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,905
Can't we just talk briefly?

688
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,074
Can't we?

689
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,785
She's smiling.

690
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,665
She smiled as she passed me.

691
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,041
Unbelievable.

692
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,001
I was saying, "Excuse me,"

693
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,129
and she looked at me while smiling.

694
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,675
Seeing her drive away smiling
sent a chill down my spine.

695
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,803
I got goosebumps all over my body.

696
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,766
This is driving me nuts.

697
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:38,730
BUSAN

698
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,650
I'm going to show you a picture.

699
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,361
Please tell me who this is.

700
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,866
I got it.

701
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,701
Who is this?

702
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,662
He's my second-oldest brother.

703
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,457
His name is Park Du-seon.

704
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,095
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

705
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,891
Is Mr. Park Du-seon here?

706
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,433
Who are you?

707
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,394
I'm Jo Seong-hyeon, a producer at MBC.

708
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,230
There's no one here by that name.

709
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,481
- You're at the wrong place.
- Sorry?

710
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,191
- No, I'm not him.
- Sorry?

711
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,359
I'm not him.

712
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,238
I don't know who Park Du-seon is.

713
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,489
He's not here.

714
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,909
- He's not?
- No.

715
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,201
Who's Park In-geun?

716
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,955
Mr. Park In-geun,
the director of Brothers' Home.

717
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,958
- Where is this Brothers' Home?
- Jurye-dong.

718
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,002
Unbelievable.

719
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:46,172
- But weren't you the general secretary?
- No, I wasn't.

720
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,383
Sir, the victims
just want to hear an apology.

721
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:54,013
This person was partially paralyzed
while in the mental health facility.

722
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,642
Don't you think these people are victims?

723
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,477
I don't think so.

724
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,564
They have nothing to do with me,
so just go.

725
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,524
- Those people aren't victims?
- No.

726
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,068
Why do you say they aren't?

727
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,155
Why are they victims?
What are you bothering me for?

728
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,993
They just want an apology.
Do you have no intention of apologizing?

729
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,495
Sir?

730
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,250
- They just want to hear an apology.
- What apology?

731
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,463
Can't you just take a look at this
with me?

732
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,798
Please?

733
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,175
Let's go.

734
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,969
I already have a passenger.

735
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,179
Sorry.

736
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,683
Sir, don't be like this.

737
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,896
- This business won't last either.
- Seriously...

738
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,941
But these people's lives have been ruined.

739
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,318
What do they have to do with me?

740
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,530
My life was ruined too.

741
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,367
Why was your life ruined?

742
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,287
The government acknowledged what happened.

743
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,165
Over 600 people died.

744
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,668
Sir.

745
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:10,090
Over 600 people died in the institution
you and your father ran.

746
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,676
You won't refute any of this?

747
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,845
- No.
- You're not refuting it?

748
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,471
Sir.

749
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,599
Sir!

750
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,151
All those vengeful souls.

751
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,446
Aren't they afraid?

752
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,074
If you so much as hurt someone,

753
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,953
you'd normally feel guilty about it.

754
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,624
His entire family

755
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,003
took those people and exploited them

756
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,174
to make money, using them as tools.

757
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,554
Why do you think
he said he wasn't Park Du-seon?

758
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,682
Mr. Jo, I'm sorry,

759
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,602
can we resume in five minutes
after I smoke a cigarette?

760
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,937
- Sure.
- That question makes me feel suffocated.

761
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,897
Go ahead.

762
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,649
Thank you. Sorry about that.

763
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,872
I really don't understand it either.

764
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:29,586
I don't understand
why they told such blatant lies

765
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,421
when the truth could be easily revealed.

766
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,383
In my view, Brothers' Home

767
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,551
was the perpetrator.

768
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,595
But I believe

769
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,597
the Korean government

770
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,476
is most responsible for what happened,

771
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,353
as they gave the orders.

772
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,688
Instead of just me,

773
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,234
the son of Director Park In-geun,
stepping up,

774
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,279
the government should also say,

775
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,116
"Yes, these things were wrong back then."

776
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,159
They should own up to it

777
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,745
and offer sincere apologies.

778
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,123
That's what I think.

779
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,251
Once again,

780
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,546
I would like to extend...

781
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,509
my apologies

782
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,597
to the victims and their families

783
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,976
who suffered during their time...

784
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,648
at Brothers' Home,

785
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,111
and for all the pain
they've endured since.

786
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,331
From my perspective,
this is not a genuine apology.

787
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,919
A true, genuine apology

788
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,673
should include specific measures
he will take

789
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,633
to make amends.

790
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,303
This is nothing but...

791
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,139
All I'm hearing are excuses,
blaming the police,

792
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,017
the government, and the city of Busan.

793
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,234
THE BROTHERS' HOME INCIDENT
IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE

794
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,818
THAT OCCURRED FROM 1975 TO 1987

795
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,029
UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP

796
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,491
38,000 PEOPLE WERE DETAINED,
WITH 657 OFFICIAL DEATHS.

797
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,245
PARK IN-GEUN,
KNOWN AS THE KING OF BROTHERS' HOME,

798
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,956
DIED IN A NURSING HOME IN 2016

799
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,875
PARK CHEON-GWANG WAS THE FIRST
IN HIS FAMILY

800
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,335
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCIDENT

801
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,922
PASTOR LIM YOUNG-SOON
DID NOT EXERCISE HIS RIGHT OF REPLY

802
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:26,388
EVEN TODAY, BROTHERS' HOME VICTIMS
CONTINUE TO DIE FROM SUICIDE AND ILLNESS

803
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,685
IN 2024, THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT
APPEALED THE RULING

804
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,855
REGARDING COMPENSATION
FOR THE BROTHERS' HOME VICTIMS

805
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,443
AS OF 2025, 38 YEARS
AFTER BROTHERS' HOME SHUT DOWN,

806
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,114
THE POLICE HAVE YET TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE INCIDENT

807
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,284
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

808
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,538
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY

809
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:52,098
