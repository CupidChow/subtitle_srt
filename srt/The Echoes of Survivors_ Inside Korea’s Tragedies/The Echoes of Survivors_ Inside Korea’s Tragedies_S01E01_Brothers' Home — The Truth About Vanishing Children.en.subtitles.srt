THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF CHILD ABUSE

2
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,620
REPAY THE PEOPLE THROUGH SELF-RELIANCE

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,559
It's exactly the same. Even the blankets.

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,479
It was exactly like this.

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,107
They crammed all of us victims
into one room.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,617
This feels just like
when I was dragged in back in the '80s.

8
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,120
Those tracksuits.
And those iron gates too.

9
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,792
BROTHERS' HOME

10
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,753
I never imagined I'd be back
in this dreaded tracksuit after 40 years.

11
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,257
In legal terms,
it was kidnapping and imprisonment.

12
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,176
To them, we weren't human.

13
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,677
BUSAN VAGRANT REHABILITATION VEHICLE

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,642
For them,
it was like putting a pig in its cage.

15
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,687
And they got paid the price of a pig.

16
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,942
They would pick a person up
and slam them down like this.

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,863
They grabbed the kid and slammed them down
onto the concrete floor.

18
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,534
You wouldn't even treat
an animal like that.

19
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,745
The children were treated like toys.

20
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,581
27TH PLATOON

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,543
If you were docile enough,
they'd keep you around as their plaything.

22
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,961
A sexual plaything.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,799
It felt like something
straight out of Squid Game.

24
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,345
I think
they were trying to tame us like animals.

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,683
Even when people died,
they didn't so much as bat an eye.

26
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,811
Those memories never leave you,

27
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,688
even after 40 years.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,153
They're a burden I'll have to live with
until the day I die.

29
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,949
Yes, I wanted to survive,
but not like this.

30
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,367
Back then…

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:50,170
BROTHERS' HOME

32
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,882
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

33
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,693
I was consumed by self-contempt,
wondering why my life was like this.

34
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,031
There was a sense of guilt too.

35
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,744
I kept asking myself why I had to live
my whole life in confinement.

36
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,669
CHOI SEUNG-U
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

37
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,223
How many prior convictions
do you have again?

38
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,894
Including convictions
for obstruction of justice and violence,

39
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,021
I've got 39 convictions.

40
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,148
Thirty-nine convictions?

41
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,608
Yes.

42
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:44,033
Most of them, probably around 30,
are for obstruction of justice.

43
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,579
You see, over the course of my life,

44
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:54,002
I've suffered a great deal of trauma
at the hands of the police.

45
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,968
I used to get into fights with the cops
over the smallest things.

46
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:07,181
I'd curse at them and say things like,
"Fuck you, assholes."

47
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,353
Why do you hate the police so much?

48
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,775
After the police locked me up,

49
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:23,823
I was beaten so badly
that both my eardrums burst.

50
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,828
By the time I was 28,

51
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,831
I'd lost all my teeth.

52
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,207
If you take a look…

53
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,548
I'm wearing full dentures now,
upper and lower.

54
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,133
I don't have any teeth left.

55
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,393
From a very young age, I…

56
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,811
Since then,

57
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,398
I experienced so much pain.

58
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,818
The fear was overwhelming.

59
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
On top of that…

60
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,791
I think I was deeply terrified
of the world outside.

61
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:42,068
BUSAN

62
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,698
I lived in Busan at the time.

63
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,748
It was sometime around April 1982.

64
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,833
Back then,

65
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,587
the yellow forsythias
had just started to bloom.

66
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,426
I was 14.

67
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,221
I had just started middle school.

68
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,975
It was time to go home,

69
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,187
and I wanted to see my friends that day
for some reason.

70
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,192
There's a pedestrian overpass
up the road from Gaegeum Intersection,

71
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
heading toward the Gaegeum Precinct.

72
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:30,741
I was crossing the overpass
on my way to where my friends lived.

73
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,953
And a police officer

74
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,206
was smoking a cigarette right there.

75
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,420
I was about to walk right by him,
minding my business,

76
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,380
when he called out, "Hey, kid!"

77
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,424
"Come over here."

78
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,968
"I said come over here, punk."

79
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,637
He grabbed me by the shoulder.

80
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,681
He said, "Get in,"

81
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,642
as he dragged me
into the Gaegeum Precinct 1.

82
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,144
GAEGEUM PRECINCT

83
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,814
He said,
"We need to check your belongings."

84
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,442
He went through my bag

85
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,279
and found some bread in it.

86
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,908
He asked, "Where did you get this, punk?"

87
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,784
"You better come clean."

88
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,995
"You stole it, didn't you?
You little punk."

89
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,916
I said,
"No, they handed them out at school."

90
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,460
"Why are you doing this?
Please let me go home."

91
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,379
And then, all of a sudden,

92
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,174
he accused me of lying

93
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
and started beating me with a club.

94
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,309
He just kept hitting me with that club.
It hurt like hell.

95
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,812
My heart raced, and my hands shook.
My whole body trembled.

96
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,277
Then he stripped me naked,

97
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,279
took the lighter he'd used,

98
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,699
heated it until it was red-hot…

99
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,913
and burned my dick.

100
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,666
He burned my penis with it.

101
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,834
The pain was excruciating.

102
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,756
"You'd be home if you told the truth.
Why lie to me?"

103
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,383
"Tell me the truth, punk."

104
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,641
So I ended up admitting
that I stole that bread.

105
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:23,604
GAEGEUM PRECINCT

106
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,692
But it was then
that the officer made a call.

107
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,112
About 20 to 30 minutes later,

108
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,907
two people walked in wearing hats.

109
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,620
When they looked at me,

110
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,831
a cold shiver ran down my back.

111
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,791
And then they said,

112
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,460
"You, come over here."

113
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,838
"I said come here, kid."

114
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,842
"Why? Where are you taking me?"

115
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,095
"You said you'd let me go home, Officer."

116
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,597
"What's the problem?"

117
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:03,060
Tears welled up as I screamed,
"Why are you doing this?"

118
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,314
I was so scared back then

119
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,774
that I pissed my pants.

120
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,289
There was a vehicle, a van.

121
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,458
It was like those refrigerated vans.

122
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,126
BROTHERS' HOME

123
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,672
They were trying to force me
into the back of the van.

124
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,761
I was begging for my life then, but…

00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,107
I live with my older sister Han Sin-ye.

130
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,574
-What did you draw?
-I drew these.

132
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,452
I drew many things.

133
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,746
Potato. This is a potato. Potato.

134
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,457
Pear, potato, potato.

135
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,584
Pear, potato.

136
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,422
Here. Pear, potato, potato.

137
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,464
Pear, potato.

138
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,551
They look delicious, right? The potatoes.

139
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,598
She doesn't look like it,

140
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,061
but my sister has been diagnosed
with a grade-two mental disability.

141
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:15,818
Her memory is stuck
somewhere between 1984 and '87.

142
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,987
Did your sister
not have a disability then?

143
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,904
No.

144
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,450
She was smart,
active, and got good grades.

00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,418

BUSAN, 1984

149
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,379
…and my sister was in the fourth.

150
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,384
It was just like any other day.

151
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,056
My sister and I finished school,

152
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,102
and we went out with our dad.

153
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,816
We went on rides at Yongdusan Park…

154
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,614
played games at the arcade,
and had some cotton candy.

155
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,411
We were just heading home

156
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,915
when we happened to stop by
the Donggwang Precinct.

157
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,957
BUILDING A JUST SOCIETY

158
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,586
At the precinct,
Dad said, "I'll be back soon."

159
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,297
"Wait here and sit tight."
Then he went out.

160
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:24,887
And not long after,
two men came into the precinct.

161
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,643
They greeted and shook hands with the man
I assumed to be the officer in charge.

162
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,523
They signed some sort of papers
and exchanged them.

163
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,025
And they put us in the van.

164
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,155
They just picked up my sister and me
and took us away.

165
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,620
We started screaming,
saying our dad told us to wait there.

166
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,665
That we needed to wait for him.
That we were going home.

167
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,502
That was the first time
the officer at the precinct spoke.

168
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,965
I think he said something like,
"Get in already. Off you go."

-Let's go!
-Go!

171
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,520
They drove around the neighborhood
for a while,

172
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,356
loading more people into the van.

173
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,957
There must have been seven or eight people
in that van by the time we got out.

174
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,008
It all happened within 15 to 20 minutes.

175
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,053
Once the car stopped,

176
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,264
I got out when they told me to.

177
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,354
In front of me were these iron gates.

178
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,650
REPAY THE PEOPLE THROUGH SELF-RELIANCE

179
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,487
A loud clunk followed by soft murmurs.

180
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,284
I think the door opened after that.

181
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,077
ESCORTING IN THE VAGRANTS

182
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,122
We passed a huge building,
then went up a hill…

183
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,754
where rows of identical buildings
stood on either side.

184
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,800
I think we went up to the second floor
of one of the buildings.

185
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,595
They took us to the second floor

186
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,431
and told us to go into the bathroom.

187
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,977
They told us to take off all our clothes.

188
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,566
They dumped several buckets
of cold water over us.

189
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,654
They told us to dry off with a towel,

190
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,324
then go into the room and get into bed
without any clothes on.

191
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,537
There were beds,

192
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,125
six on each side, so 12 in total.

193
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,047
They said they'd let us go home

194
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,550
if we listened
and stayed under the blanket on the bed.

195
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,683
As soon as we went in,
they separated the men and women

196
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,143
and placed us into "platoons."

197
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,359
My sister and I were separated
at the iron gates to the platoons.

198
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,531
I got tired after all the crying
and begging to go home,

199
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,450
and I think I fell asleep for a bit.

200
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,415
But then I felt

201
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:45,170
someone touching my body.

202
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,175
I was naked.

203
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,596
Someone inserted his penis

204
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,726
deep into my anus.

205
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,278
When I screamed in pain,

206
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,324
he covered my mouth
and continued the sexual assault.

207
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,784
I was raped.

208
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,334
After I was raped,

209
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,962
I could feel the blood

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,257
coming out of my anus.

211
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,803
I used toilet paper
to stop the bleeding from my anus,

212
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,390
then just lay there curled up on the bed,

213
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,518
still completely naked.

214
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,446
He came back the next evening

215
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,409
and said he'd treat my anus,
which still had toilet paper stuck to it.

216
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:03,457
He brought a towel
and wiped away all the blood.

217
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,920
Then he used force on me again,

218
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,298
and I was raped a second time.

219
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,927
It was excruciating.

220
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,809
BROTHERS' HOME

221
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,560
"I want to go home."

222
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,105
"I miss my grandma."

223
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,572
"I just want this nightmare to be over."

224
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,041
BE VIRTUOUS

225
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,337
SAFETY FIRST

226
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,258
After pulling myself together,

227
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,344
I looked around
and was stunned by what I saw.

228
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,223
About 70 or 80 people
were locked up in there.

229
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
Up until that point,

230
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:10,566
I never imagined that so many children
would be in one place.

231
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,944
KIM GEON-SU (ALIAS)
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

232
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,530
I must have been
around nine or ten years old.

233
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,948
HEO JEONG-O
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

234
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,783
I was probably no older than six or seven.

235
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,577
CHOI SU-HYEON (ALIAS)
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

236
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,078
I was probably around nine.

237
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,956
The cop said he would help me
find my way home.

238
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,374
I still remember that.

239
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,670
The police officer asked me
for my personal information.

240
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,757
"Just give us a moment,
and I'll get you home."

241
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,176
LEE HYE-YUL
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

242
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,430
The detective told me
my mom would be there.

243
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,224
I was at Busan Station.

244
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,895
My grandmother had been next to me

245
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,480
but stepped away for a moment.

246
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,400
That's when someone came up to me

247
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,446
and asked
if I had run away from home or something.

248
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,239
So I told them no

249
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,825
and said I was there with an adult,
my grandmother.

250
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,744
They still told me to come.

251
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,498
Anyone found alone was
placed in that prison van and taken away,

252
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,083
regardless of the reason.

253
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,377
KIM GYEONG-U
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

254
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,964
I remember it clearly. It read,
"Busan Vagrant Rehabilitation Vehicle."

255
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:23,180
BUSAN VAGRANT REHABILITATION VEHICLE

256
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,557
As soon as you go in,

257
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,892
they shave your head.

258
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,477
YANG HYEON-SEON
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

259
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,437
They shave your head completely bald.

260
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,612
They gave us…

261
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,241
they gave us these blue tracksuits.

262
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,993
They stripped us down
like they do in prison.

263
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,703
KANG SIN-U
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

264
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,789
You know how in prison
they give you that uniform

265
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,165
and tell you to wear it?

266
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,042
Just like that, they gave us these.

267
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,879
I think it was two days later.

268
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,383
They told me to come take a photo,

269
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,677
so I took one, from what I remember.

270
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,599
"84-10-3618."

271
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,519
That's what it says.

272
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,022
What does that mean?

273
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,191
I was inmate number 3,618,

274
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,319
brought in October of '84.

275
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,491
I was Number 3618, and my sister was 3617.

276
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,203
HAN SIN-YE, BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR
FORCIBLY DETAINED AT 11 YEARS OF AGE

277
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,207
HAN JONG-SEON, BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR
FORCIBLY DETAINED AT 9 YEARS OF AGE

278
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,334
PARK SUN-I
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

279
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,796
At the time, I didn't know my number.
It was some time after I was brought in

280
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,882
that I learned my number was 3038.

281
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,345
That means there were 3,038 people there.

282
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,783
I absolutely dreaded the punishments.

283
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,370
When they yelled, "Down on your head,"

284
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,749
we had to press our heads
to the bare ground.

285
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,334
Just like this.

286
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,794
This was "Get down."

287
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,236
And if they wanted to make it
more painful,

288
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,615
we had to interlock our fingers.

289
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,539
How old were you
when you went through this?

290
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,085
I went through it from the age of seven.

291
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,588
We got beaten all the time.

292
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,965
I prayed every day it wouldn't happen.

293
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,219
"Dusting" was the one word
I dreaded the most.

294
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,848
It was usually on dusting days
that something bad would happen.

295
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,357
IN THERE, WE WERE NOT HUMAN

296
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,568
What discomfort are you feeling right now?

297
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,571
My left arm and my left leg,

298
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,784
I can barely use them,

299
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,285
and I limp when walking.

300
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,623
I have nerve paralysis
from a cerebral infarction,

301
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,916
so now I limp a lot.

302
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,297
While I was in there, my teeth…

303
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,382
All of these…

304
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,759
None of these are my own.

305
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,053
They were knocked out.

306
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,567
They were about this big.

307
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,028
Have you seen
those old-fashioned pickaxes?

308
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,906
You know, the wooden handle part.

309
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,160
They hit me exactly 150 times with it.

310
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,622
The wood used to make
those pickaxe handles

311
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,460
is a lot sturdier than normal wood.

312
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,422
They would soak it in water all day.

313
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,008
When it gets soaked,

314
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,469
it becomes extremely heavy.

315
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,099
Just imagine how much it would hurt
if that thing hit you.

316
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,643
I mean, it's just…

317
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,733
They tied me up and covered me
so I couldn't move.

318
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,153
I was beaten relentlessly from then on.

319
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,658
They stomped on my head
while I was down on the ground.

320
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,412
My head kept slamming
into the concrete floor.

321
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,165
What's more, I was tied up.

322
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,919
Whenever my head lifted,
they stomped on it again, over and over.

323
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,338
So my head kept going up and down.

324
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,927
You must have seen
the others being beaten up too.

325
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,053
Yes, I did.

326
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,265
The kid couldn't hear or speak.

327
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,975
Called him Dum-dum.

328
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,854
He had hearing and speech disabilities.

329
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
ESTIMATED AGE: 11
CONDITIONS: EPILEPSY

330
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,442
They would pick a person up
and slam them down like this.

331
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,823
They grabbed the kid and slammed them down
onto the concrete floor.

332
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,826
When you throw a kid…

333
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,039
Obviously, a kid thrown like that
will cry from the pain.

334
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,625
They'd throw him again for crying.

335
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,089
After being thrown a few times,
he stopped crying.

336
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,592
And that was the last time we saw him.

337
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,096
He probably died. He must have died.

338
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,348
Why would they do that?

339
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,183
The only way

340
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:05,063
for a small group to subdue a larger one
is by instilling fear

341
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,274
through violence and assault.

342
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,693
That's how they treated us.

343
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,574
They took us somewhere to break rocks
and put us to work right away.

344
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,200
They didn't even give us gloves.

345
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:25,959
Woodwork, mother-of-pearl lacquerware,
ironwork, shoemaking, sewing…

346
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,170
If the retaining walls collapsed
or something,

347
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,424
we were forced to do labor
on the mountain,

348
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:36,011
carrying burlap sacks full of dirt
and transporting them.

349
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,558
I thought, "What the hell is this place?"
That's when I finally came to my senses.

350
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,144
"Man, what the hell am I doing here?"

351
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,694
What kind of place was this?

352
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,906
Why were we brought here?

353
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,868
I still have no idea why.

354
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,162
Why did they do that to us?

355
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,875
Why did you bring us here?

356
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,094
BUSAN TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR VAGRANTS

357
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,281
Hello.

358
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
Yes, hello.

359
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,911
EOM NAM-HYEON
FAMILY OF BROTHERS' HOME VICTIM

360
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,634
What did you say to your family
before coming here today?

361
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,970
I told them the truth.
About the interview on the Brothers' Home.

362
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,181
Yes, I was honest with them.

363
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,141
How did your family react?

364
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,978
Not a single member of my family
wanted me to do it.

365
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,358
Especially my mother,
who doesn't want to be reminded.

366
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,319
So everyone in my family was against it.

367
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,994
My father

368
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,997
ran a business for a long time.

369
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,126
Back in those days,

370
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,713
his company was
among the top 100 in Busan.

371
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,006
It was a pretty big business.

372
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,803
I think our home was
about 18,000 square feet.

373
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,682
My father liked bonsai plants,

374
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,309
so we had a greenhouse

375
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,228
as well as a pond.

376
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,317
I can't quite recall the exact date,

377
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,530
but my brother left home once in '85

378
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,909
and went off the grid
for more than a week.

379
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,830
EOM MUN-HYEON,
WHO WENT MISSING AT THE TIME

380
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,293
And the thing about my brother
is that he was deaf and nonverbal.

381
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,964
It just didn't make any sense.

382
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,050
So after a week or so,

383
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,219
I went out to look for him.

384
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,640
I asked around in a lot of places.

385
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,352
But no one had seen him.

386
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,859
Then about six or seven months passed.

387
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,823
Someone kept ringing the doorbell.

388
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,242
So we went to check who it was,

389
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,994
and it was my brother, Mun-hyeon.

390
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:54,959
And he was wearing this raggedy tracksuit
we'd never seen before.

391
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,047
He came home wearing only that.

392
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,970
Looking at him…

393
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,100
He looked like he was barely alive.

394
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,269
I mean, just…

395
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,738
You know those images
of kids dealing with severe hunger?

396
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:28,451
Children with their ribs sticking out,
their bones and bodies so small.

397
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,870
That's how he was.

398
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,624
Just how badly starved and hungry
must he have been?

399
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,558
I asked him where he'd been.

400
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,855
I asked, "Where have you been?"
and he wrote his answer.

401
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,364
"Brothers' Home."

402
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,994
BROTHERS' HOME

403
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,668
At the time,
I was too caught up to notice it,

404
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,128
but later,

405
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,214
I saw a mark

406
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,926
with "HJ" written on it.

407
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:37,562
I think it stood for "hyeongje,"
which means "brothers."

408
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,859
I asked where I was,

409
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,446
and they told me,
"Brothers' Home in Busan."

410
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:51,284
LET'S BE THE PILLARS OF YUSHIN
THROUGH THE SAEMAEUL SPIRIT

411
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,494
The address was San 18 in Jurye-dong.

412
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,623
I remember it so clearly.

413
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,084
The address of the Brothers' Home

414
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,795
was always San 18, Jurye-dong.

415
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,844
Located at San 18,
Jurye-dong, Buk-gu, Busan,

416
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,430
this is the vagrant asylum Brothers' Home.

417
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,478
THE REASON WE WERE DRAGGED HERE

418
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,236
I've got peace like a river

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,323
I've got peace like a river

420
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,911
The Brothers' Home had a church
called Hanmaeum Church.

421
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,998
The church was enormous.

422
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:46,381
Park In-geun would gather
all 3,000 of us in there every Monday

423
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,008
and preach for an hour or two.

424
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,428
Every single week, he'd say,

425
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,181
"You people are human garbage."

426
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,144
"You're a worthless part of society."

427
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,190
"You've all become human by coming here."

428
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,360
"You are now a human being
of the Republic of Korea."

429
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,781
"Out in society,
you would've been leeching off others,

430
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:17,161
harming those
who are just trying to live normal lives."

431
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,247
"You're human garbage."

432
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,835
"Everyone in the nation is ecstatic

433
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,878
to have you here."

434
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:31,217
"Why? There are no more vagrants, bums,

435
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,387
or panhandlers on the streets."

436
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,932
"The streets are clean now."

437
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,606
CHO SAENG-RAE
ACQUAINTANCE OF PARK IN-GEUN

438
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,775
Back then,
the Brothers' Home was necessary.

439
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,361
Many said the Brothers' Home

440
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,407
was what vagrants needed
to become decent human beings.

441
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,871
For many, the community in Busan
was the final stop,

442
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,666
and honestly,
it was full of the underprivileged.

443
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,377
There were homeless people
on every corner,

444
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,966
along with two-bit thugs, so to speak,
and other unsavory characters.

445
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,180
There was no place
for people like them to be managed.

446
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:21,059
Frankly, no one was willing to step up
and do that kind of work.

447
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,981
Director Park In-geun is an eccentric man

448
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,901
who willingly took the initiative.

449
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,865
To boldly take that on
is nothing short of heroic.

450
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,201
Honestly, I see him as a hero.

451
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,577
A pioneer, if you will.

452
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:45,041
A burning blue fire rises
in Director Park In-geun's heart.

453
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,627
In the mindset of vagrants,

454
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,837
it seems like they lack

455
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,924
the concept or habit of order from birth.

456
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,344
He claimed
he was bringing in the vagrants,

457
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,221
dressing them in clean clothes,

458
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,181
and rehabilitating them.

459
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,518
Poverty is no one else's fault.

460
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,481
Moreover, order can't be maintained
through academia or knowledge alone.

461
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,532
BROTHERS' HOME
SOCIAL WELFARE ORGANIZATION

462
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,575
BUSAN TEMPORARY SHELTER FOR VAGRANTS

463
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,661
VAGRANT

464
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,496
A PERSON WITH NO FIXED RESIDENCE OR JOB

465
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,790
WANDERING AIMLESSLY
WITH A SELF-INDULGENT LIFESTYLE

466
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,334
Were you a vagrant at the time?

467
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,044
No.

468
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,129
No.

469
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,922
No, I wasn't.

470
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,216
I had both parents.

471
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:44,100
CHILDREN WHO WERE TAKEN
TO THE BROTHERS' HOME

472
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,769
I would've called them beggars
when I was little.

473
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,062
Homeless people.

474
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,606
It was a place for people like that,

475
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,567
but in hindsight,

476
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,361
anyone could have ended up there.

477
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,780
Because I did.

478
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,032
I was just a kid.

479
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,328
Back then, I just thought I was unlucky.

480
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,913
Either that

481
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,500
or maybe our father
sent us there temporarily

482
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,878
because it was hard
for him to raise us alone.

483
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:16,048
Of course, I'm sure
there were some vagrants in there.

484
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,510
I can't say that none of them
were vagrants, but…

485
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,180
I'd say 95% of them
weren't actually vagrants.

486
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,308
They had families, they were students,

487
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,018
or they had jobs.

488
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,395
That was the majority.

489
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,397
Every night, I wondered,

490
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,776
"Why isn't Dad coming to get us?"

491
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,739
I thought about it every single night.

492
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,500
Sin-ye was mature from a very young age.

493
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:57,506
She had already realized
it wasn't a place anyone should live.

494
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,260
She would leave her platoon to find me,

495
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,888
grab my hand, and try to take me home.

496
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,018
Whenever she did, it led to a beating
from my platoon's group leader.

497
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,354
Then the 23rd Platoon leader would come

498
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,483
and drag her away by the hair.

499
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,196
But I couldn't get close to her.

500
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,031
They said they'd kill me.

501
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,075
Whenever I went to my sister,

502
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:29,080
they'd stop us from hanging out,
saying she was in another platoon.

503
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:35,419
Since Sin-ye kept coming to mine, this is
what the group leaders made me do.

504
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,965
They told me to repeat after them.

505
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,094
"Hey, you fucking bitch."
That's what they wanted me to say.

506
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,222
Then I would repeat those words to her.

507
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,057
"Hey, you fucking bitch."

508
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,934
"Don't ever come back here."

509
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,646
They made me say it, so I did.

510
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,858
FIGURINES MADE BY HAN JONG-SEON

511
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,820
They used all kinds of punishments,

512
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,989
including beatings

513
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:08,452
and unspeakable acts
that resembled sexual violence.

514
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,956
In their system, it was inevitable

515
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,209
that the whole group would be punished
for the actions of one person.

516
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,671
Back then, female platoon members
would approach me and say,

517
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,298
"Keep your sister in line."

518
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,925
"Our whole group is being disciplined
because of her."

519
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,012
And they would tell me in detail
what the people there did to her.

520
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,100
They placed a plastic bag
over a mop handle

521
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:35,104
and repeatedly shoved it
into her anus or genitals.

522
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,316
And when that didn't work,

523
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,737
they kept giving her
large doses of chlorpromazine.

524
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,905
That's what destroyed her.

525
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,374
CHLORPROMAZINE

526
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,293
ANTIPSYCHOTIC FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS

527
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,712
SIDE EFFECTS: MOVEMENT DYSFUNCTION,
TD, NMS, SYNCOPE

528
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,297
HEPATOPATHY, PARKINSON'S DISEASE

529
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,009
BROTHERS' HOME

530
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,261
Back then, my sister was…

531
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,221
How can I put this?

532
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,853
She seemed completely lost.
She couldn't say a word.

533
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,313
Just sat there blankly.

534
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,942
"Yes, let's go home together."

535
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,695
I should've told her that.

536
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,784
That's what I should've said to her.

537
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,789
I should've grabbed her hand,
said, "Let's go home," and ran.

538
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,626
But I couldn't bring myself to do that.

539
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,727
How come no one who went through that
ever fought back?

540
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,771
There was no way we could fight back.

541
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,065
They'd just beat us up more.

542
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,734
Who would dare fight back?

543
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,450
There was an air of fear in that place.
Fear of being beaten.

544
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,243
Fear of punishment.

545
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,913
Those fears were deeply ingrained
in the inmates.

546
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,207
Who beat you?

547
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,501
Well, that was mostly

548
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,921
the group leaders and the platoon leader.

549
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,301
In each platoon, there were three of them.

550
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,429
A platoon leader,
a group leader, and a group manager.

551
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,348
Above them was a commander at the top.

552
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,644
An older girl told me to just stay still.

553
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,109
No matter where
or how the commander hit me,

554
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,948
she told me to stay still
if I wanted to get out of there alive.

555
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,793
Back then, in that place,
the children were treated

556
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,712
like toys.

557
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:52,510
Toys they could torture
whenever they felt like it.

558
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:02,853
If you were docile enough,
they'd keep you around as their plaything.

559
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,063
A sexual plaything.

560
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,862
My nickname was "Tongtti."

561
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:19,119
That was the nickname
given to the kids who were raped there.

562
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:27,044
"Tong" refers to the anus,

563
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:31,423
and "tti" means
that several people take turns with them.

564
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:37,805
That's why they call
the child who gets raped "Tongtti."

565
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,975
YOUNG CHOI SEUNG-U

566
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:46,146
There was also what was called an orgy.
So-called group sex.

567
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:52,778
They would bring two or three cute kids,
about seven or eight years old,

568
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,365
and forced them
to engage in sexual acts with each other,

569
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:01,328
including having one
insert his penis into another.

570
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,583
Such sexual abuse
was widespread in the platoons.

571
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,670
After about three days,

572
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,089
you have no choice but to obey.

573
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,133
Like machines.

574
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:19,013
And I think
they were trying to tame us like animals.

575
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,601
That was the system
and the rule at the Brothers' Home.

576
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,064
PARK IN-GEUN
BROTHERS' HOME DIRECTOR

577
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,192
Who was the scariest person
in the Brothers' Home?

578
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,697
The director.

579
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,450
Park In-geun.

580
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,952
It was definitely Park In-geun.

581
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:47,916
Had Park In-geun not kidnapped
and brought us there,

582
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,128
those guys would never have beaten us.

583
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,011
At the Brothers' Home,

584
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,804
he was like the president.

585
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,057
He was the president.

586
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,809
Park In-geun was the one

587
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,271
who kept everything running
at the Brothers' Home.

588
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,481
WITH FAITH, HOPE, AND LOVE

589
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:15,152
All orders came from Park In-geun.

590
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,822
He was basically a god.
Like an emperor of the place.

591
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,911
He wielded absolute power
inside those walls.

592
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:28,165
One word from him could determine
whether someone lived or died.

593
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,794
I got beaten a lot.

594
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,254
LEE CHUN-SEOK
BROTHERS' HOME SURVIVOR

595
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,964
He would start whaling on you mercilessly

596
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,885
if you made the mistake of stammering
while giving a report.

597
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,056
He would put on black leather gloves,

598
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,266
shake out his hands
with a watch on one wrist,

599
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,853
then punch you in the cheek
like he was boxing.

600
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,943
He'd beat you while saying,
"I'm punishing you on behalf of God."

601
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:02,950
Or he'd whack you with his wooden sword
or kick the shit out of you.

602
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,120
To him, we weren't even human.

603
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,125
If we had cuts, bruises, or were bleeding,

604
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,129
he'd say, "You don't need any medicine.
You're not worthy of the hospital."

605
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,297
He'd just grab some salt

606
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,760
and toss it all over us
like you'd salt fish.

607
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,598
He literally threw salt
on our bleeding wounds.

608
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:32,771
Someone in my platoon
barged into the office

609
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,315
and cut open his own stomach
with a fluorescent light.

610
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,692
Just slashed himself.

611
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,198
It split wide open.

612
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,076
No exaggeration.
His intestines were hanging out.

613
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,872
Then Park In-geun said,
"Tell the commander to bring some salt."

614
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,749
So he brought some salt.

615
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,043
Park threw it on his open stomach.

616
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,053
Did you ever look for a chance to escape?

617
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,640
How could I run away
when I couldn't even go outside?

618
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,061
I would've been caught in no time.

619
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,897
Seriously, in no time.

620
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,319
A man did run away,
but he was caught and brought back.

621
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,282
About five or six people
took clubs and metal bats,

622
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,659
rolled him up in a blanket, and beat him.

623
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,537
After poking him a few times…

624
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,249
they unrolled the blanket

625
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:40,214
and said, "He's dead. Take him up."

626
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,345
If you go up to the church,
there's a cemetery there.

627
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,310
A lot of people are buried there.

628
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,440
I saw them take him up there.

629
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,754
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

630
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:31,098
APARTMENT CONSTRUCTION SITE
JURYE-DONG, BUSAN, 1993

631
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,059
LEE JIN-SEOP
IN CHARGE OF MOVING BROTHERS' HOME GRAVES

632
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,103
We had to relocate the graves

633
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:41,441
in front of the Brothers' Home to clear
the area for apartment construction.

634
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,992
We came across a few bodies
that didn't seem normal.

635
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:57,875
The first thing I found strange
was that no caskets were used.

636
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,628
There were a few graves
with bodies wrapped in blankets.

637
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,758
Blankets weren't even common back then.

638
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,054
Most people didn't use
that kind of bedding at home.

639
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,182
I thought something wasn't right.

640
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,147
Some of the blankets were army green.

641
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,150
I think there were some red ones too.

642
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:30,365
We all said to each other,
"Could these be from the Brothers' Home?"

643
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,580
Most of the remains wrapped in blankets
were children,

644
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:43,337
likely around late elementary
to middle school age.

645
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,547
They definitely weren't adults.

646
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,093
I'd say there were about 50 bodies.

647
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,434
I saw it all the time.

648
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,354
Countless people died in there.

649
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,856
Anyone taken out at night
was as good as dead.

650
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,233
A stretcher.

651
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,737
The type two people carry,
one at each end.

652
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,574
They'd place the body on it
and carry it out.

653
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,868
I saw that all the time.

654
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:23,085
Were you ever involved in carrying
and burying bodies?

655
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,002
Yes.

656
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,837
How many were assigned?

657
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,923
Only a handful of people.

658
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,678
There was a cleared hill
just above the church building.

659
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,346
That's where we buried them.

660
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,056
Those bodies

661
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,226
could've gone unnoticed for years.

662
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,604
Who gave those orders?

663
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,814
The commander.

664
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,692
One word of command from that bastard

665
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,861
and an inmate could disappear
without a trace.

666
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,199
There's no casket, just the body.

667
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,955
They were just buried in the clothes
they were wearing.

668
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,710
How did it look like those people died?

669
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,504
I'd say about 80% of them
were beaten to death.

670
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:14,678
A TOTAL OF 657 DEATHS

671
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,394
It was '86.

672
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,813
In July.

673
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,028
Mun-hyeon wasn't coming home again.

674
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,990
I was starting to get worried.

675
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,367
At that moment,

676
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,703
we got a call at home.

677
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,750
My mother answered.

678
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,211
And out of nowhere, she said,

679
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,921
"Nam-hyeon."

680
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,467
"Your brother is dead."

681
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,885
That's all she said.

682
00:50:56,136 --> 00:51:00,724
BUSAN MEDICAL CENTER

683
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,477
They had covered him with a white cloth.

684
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,191
To check if it was really Mun-hyeon,

685
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,569
I lifted the cloth and looked.

686
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,072
When I saw him at first,

687
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,657
I couldn't even tell
whether it was really him.

688
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,285
His face was severely swollen…

689
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,165
and he was covered in bruises.

690
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,798
From how badly he'd been beaten,
his face was swollen.

691
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,716
His whole body was covered in bruises.

692
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:43,183
I wondered how a person
could beat someone to death like this.

693
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,312
The person sitting next to us

694
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,399
told us
he had come from the Brothers' Home.

695
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,193
So I asked,

696
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,863
"Why on earth did my brother end up
back at the Brothers' Home?"

697
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,491
And he said he didn't know.

698
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:04,538
He said he knew nothing except
that he transported my brother's body.

699
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:12,462
NAME: EOM MUN-HYEON
DIED IN HOSPITAL

700
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,799
Why didn't you do an autopsy?

701
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,136
Firstly, my father was against it.

702
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,971
And secondly,

703
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,432
one of our relatives

704
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:28,854
was a police captain in Busan back then.

705
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,815
He came to us and said,

706
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,527
"There's no point in doing an autopsy.
Just leave it."

707
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,113
Apparently, that's how it was.

708
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,160
At the time,
I strongly pleaded with my father.

709
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:49,040
"You know, Mun-hyeon died so unfairly."

710
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,418
"He was beaten to death."

711
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,754
"We're a family with the means
to make things happen."

712
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,339
"Let's do something."

713
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,509
But all my father said was, "It's no use."

714
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,387
"It's no use."

715
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,682
And that was the end of it.

716
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:12,397
EOM MUN-HYEON

717
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,941
Was it because Park In-geun was
a shrewd operator?

718
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,485
Or because he was in a position of power?

719
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,113
No, it was because he was protected
by the government.

720
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,575
And who was behind the government?

721
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,661
It was none other than Chun Doo-hwan.

722
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,540
He couldn't have done it
without that person's protection.

723
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,294
The victim count was higher
than previously known.

724
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:38,298
Evidence suggests the government tried
to whitewash and conceal the incident.

725
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:41,843
Are you nervous?

726
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,012
Yes, very much so.

727
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,601
What scares you the most?

728
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,062
The people

729
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,107
who would be upset with me
revealing the truth.

730
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,696
My name is Park Cheon-gwang,

731
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:07,327
the youngest son of Park In-geun,
director of the Brothers' Home Foundation.

732
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,665
I am here
because I want to reveal the truth.

733
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,792
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

734
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,003
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY

735
