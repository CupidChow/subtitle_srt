1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,866
- Who is it?
- Hello.

2
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,243
Are you ***?

3
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,369
How can I help you?

4
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,079
- Are you ***?
- Yes.

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,915
I'm Jo Seong-hyeon, a producer from MBC.

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,833
Okay.

7
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,836
Could we chat briefly?

8
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,005
I'm afraid
I can't invite you in for a chat.

9
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,632
Come downstairs. We'll wait.

10
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,509
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,603
THE SPY IS CAUGHT

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,729
All the information,

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,232
including what we filmed
and where we planned to film next,

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,443
kept being leaked to JMS.

15
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,278
At one point, I thought,

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,948
"There must be a JMS spy on my team."

17
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,952
And eventually,
I found out who the spy was.

18
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:25,043
How did you end up with our file
in the first place?

19
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,004
There's a group chat with 3,000 people

20
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,632
where they assign things
like preview gigs.

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,008
E
PRODUCTION STAFF FROM SEASON 1

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,219
JMS FOLLOWER AT THE TIME

23
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,140
I did some previewing work there
as a part-time job.

24
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,352
PREVIEW

25
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:50,443
TRANSCRIBING ALL FOOTAGE
FILMED BY THE PRODUCTION STAFF

26
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,240
The file I happened to receive
was an interview

27
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,409
from <i>In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal</i>.

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,540
The file turned out to be
Pastor Kim Gyeong-cheon's interview.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,374
"Our heavenly Father!"

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,628
"Those ignorant men
are trying to crucify our president!"

31
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,881
"Please prove his innocence!"

32
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,553
But in JMS, Kim Gyeong-cheon is...

33
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,849
Kim Gyeong-cheon is the first Satan,
Kim Do-hyeong the second.

34
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,316
I thought, "His interview clip
ended up in my hands."

35
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
"Could this be God entrusting me
with the mission

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,158
to protect Pastor Jeong Myeong-seok?"

37
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,912
The person in charge
was a lady named Pastor Joo Bit-seon.

38
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:48,293
I told her the video seemed to cast
our church in a negative light.

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,133
I had barely received any letters
or responses from Pastor Jeong before,

40
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,346
but after I sent that clip,
Jeong Myeong-seok replied right away.

41
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,976
He said that God and the Holy Spirit
were working through me.

42
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,854
That it was miraculous.

43
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,314
He also said he'd pray
for my headaches to go away.

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,399
OH MY GOSH
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOOK THE TIME TO REPLY

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
That he was praying for me
three times a day.

46
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,781
Do you recall the consequences
of violating confidentiality?

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,330
That I may be held liable
for civil or criminal penalties.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,459
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,544
Going this far with the contract
felt like too much.

50
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,088
ALL INFORMATION SHARED BETWEEN PARTIES
MUST BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL

51
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,841
I contacted her the moment I saw it.

52
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,551
She said, "We can protect you.
We have lawyers."

53
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,554
YOU MUST NOT ARBITRARILY REPRODUCE,
MODIFY, TRANSFORM, OR FILM THIS CONTENT

54
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,182
"The church will of course protect you."

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,811
Where are the people
who said they'd protect you?

56
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,277
I know, right?

57
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,740
I feel so betrayed right now.

58
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,913
Honestly...

59
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,793
I trusted Bit-seon right up until today.

60
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,018
I just feel so sorry and so guilty...

61
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,648
and I honestly don't know what to do.

62
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,819
Oh man.

63
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,041
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

64
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,594
"Wherever you are,

65
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,763
please be alive."

66
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,062
Even just passing a stone,
I'd find myself looking at it and praying.

67
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,483
I tried praying to every god there was.

68
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,280
I've only prayed about that one thing
for the past ten years.

69
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,990
MOTHER OF JOO BIT-SEON, JMS SPY

70
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,285
I've never prayed about anything else.

71
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,538
All I asked was for my daughter to return.

72
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,920
I think it was a Sunday.

73
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:24,050
Bit-seon messaged me "Mom,"

74
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,136
but something felt different.

75
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,224
So I didn't say anything else
and just replied, "Yes?"

76
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,352
Then she said,
"Mom, I'm going to leave this place."

77
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,816
I went straight there without a word
and brought her home.

78
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,617
REPENTANCE

79
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:57,083
A SPY'S REPENTANCE

80
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,854
I was with JMS for 12 years.

81
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,482
I am Joo Bit-seon, deputy director
of JMS's Department of External Affairs.

82
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,902
DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
(JMS'S INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM)

83
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,613
Haven't we met before?

84
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,781
Yes.

85
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,076
I first met you, Mr. Jo,

86
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,121
when Maple was on her way to the hotel.

87
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,458
I was in the car that was following you.

88
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,881
Yes, I think
it's that car right in front of us.

89
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,632
That's the one.

90
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,345
I'll go talk to them.

91
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,564
You've been following us since yesterday
from Incheon Airport. Who are you?

92
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,191
Who are you?

93
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,778
You've been following us since yesterday
from the airport. Who are you?

94
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,615
And who are you in the back?

95
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,378
What's the Department of External Affairs?

96
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
What does it do?

97
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:31,260
The Department of External Affairs,
supposedly to protect Jeong Myeong-seok,

98
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,430
covered up his sex crimes,

99
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,392
inflicted secondary trauma on the victims,

100
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:43,147
and threatened or retaliated
against those who left the church.

101
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:53,950
Even if it was out of ignorance,
I deeply hurt the victims,

102
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,911
so I felt I had to apologize
no matter what.

103
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,412
That's why

104
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,083
I thought I needed to meet you, Mr. Jo.

105
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,586
They have another name for it, don't they?
What do they call it?

106
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,464
The Providence Security Council.

107
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,008
Or the Ministry of National Defense.

108
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:21,393
JMS DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICE

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:27,483

111
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,825

112
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,618
Well, my defense team...

113
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,204
VIDEO CONFERENCE BETWEEN JEONG
AND DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

114
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,084
To put it gently,
you're the problem solvers of Providence.

115
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,212
You solve problems

116
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,216
and, to put it plainly, you're my muscle,

117
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,722
crushing enemies with punches and kicks.

118
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,142
They have tails.

119
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,934
These are fox tails.

120
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,687
You know how foxes have tails.

121
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,522
<i>This is a picture of you crushing them.</i>

122
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,190
BITCHES AND BASTARDS, SLY AS FOXES

123
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,152
<i>You went after them
and told them not to mess with me.</i>

124
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>"Lay a hand on Pastor Jeong
and you'll pay for it."</i>

125
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,950
MICHAEL, THE PROBLEM SOLVER WITH A MISSION

126
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,786
By covering up his sex crimes

127
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:26,000
and enabling further offenses,

128
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,253
we were indeed problem solvers
to Jeong Myeong-seok.

129
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:45,227
I brought materials from my time
in the Department of External Affairs.

130
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,985
From 2012 to 2021, 2022...

131
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,822
She left JMS in February 2022,
so all the data up to that point is there.

132
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,950
- It's all in there in report form.
- All the data up to when I left...

133
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,119
I made two copies of it.

134
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,329
In here, you could...

135
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,708
It's essentially a compilation
of their internal reports.

136
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,844
That external hard drive

137
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,723
contained far more shocking content
than I ever expected.

138
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:29,187
JMS ended up with most of the footage
we filmed in season 1.

139
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,315
They had not only the raw footage
but the edited version too.

140
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,862
They also had background checks
on our production staff.

141
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,283
Among the content
relating to Jeong Myeong-seok,

142
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,286
they had lists of people
working in public investigative agencies.

143
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,788
KNOWING YOUR ENEMY ENSURES VICTORY

144
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,289
It was filled with detailed records...

145
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,166
JO SEONG-HYEON, PRODUCER OF
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

146
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,793
...of how those individuals supported JMS

147
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,046
and the illegal activities they engaged in

148
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,468
to defend and protect Jeong Myeong-seok.

149
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:10,896
THE BLESSED PROBLEM SOLVERS

150
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,606
One Monday, I went to a meeting...

151
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,859
D, FORMER MEMBER
OF JMS'S DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

152
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,195
...and heard we'd received
some preview footage.

153
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:24,284
Apparently, a member named ***,
who was doing part-time previewing work,

154
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,620
came across JMS-related content.

155
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,373
They said, "This is God helping us."

156
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,086
"God is helping us
prevent this from airing."

157
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:40,759
"Let's analyze the preview footage
and respond accordingly."

158
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,638
After that, I infiltrated the group
in the guise of a part-time worker

159
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,060
and collected any footage
that appeared related to JMS.

160
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,979
LOOKING FOR A PREVIEWER
FOR INTERVIEW CLIPS

161
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,981
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL (MBC)

162
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,232
THE FILES ARE READY NOW!

163
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,193
PREVIEWER 1: I CAN WORK ON IT NOW

164
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,862
PREVIEWER 1 INVITED PREVIEWER 2,
PREVIEWER 3, PREVIEWER 4...

165
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,948
Not counting the one
who got us the previewing job,

166
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,951
eight or nine of us joined the group.

167
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,040
PREVIEW FOOTAGE OBTAINED
BY JMS'S DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

168
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:17,587
AT LEAST 129 FILES
COMPRISING 148 HOURS OF FOOTAGE

169
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,674
Jeong Myeong-seok was very pleased

170
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,052
the preview footage ended up
in JMS's hands.

171
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,515
Knowing the plaintiffs ahead of time

172
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,519
meant knowing their legal strategy.

173
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,356
We'd know how the show
planned to depict the church as well.

174
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,566
I think Jeong Myeong-seok believed

175
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,446
that he wouldn't go to prison
until the end.

176
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,118
If I remember correctly, I was in the car.

177
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:53,123
The previewer contacted me
while I was in the car.

178
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,294
The footage I received

179
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,466
was a Zoom interview clip featuring Maple.

180
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,345
JANUARY 30, 2022
FOOTAGE OF A VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH MAPLE

181
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,474
I'm bringing this to light to ensure

182
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,978
that there are no more victims.

183
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,691
Seeing the girls
who are still in the church

184
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,987
makes me angry and heartbroken.

185
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,283
All I want is to protect them,

186
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,078
but they just see me as crazy.

187
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,584
So I've decided not to stay anonymous.

188
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,756
I remember
the director of external affairs

189
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,844
making an urgent phone call.

190
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,681
"Maple gave an interview?
We're in trouble."

191
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,849
"We're in serious trouble."

192
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,642
Everyone was thinking,

193
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:59,899
"This is the most serious situation
we've faced."

194
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,776
"Maple?
And she's not even staying anonymous?"

195
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,029
S, FORMER MEMBER
OF JMS'S DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

196
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,824
That would mean everyone at JMS
would know what happened.

197
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,578
Because Maple was well-known
in the church.

198
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,289
"Maple was sexually assaulted."

199
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,958
Her simply speaking out

200
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,379
could impact the broader congregation.

201
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,642
PROVIDENCE SECURITY COUNCIL
DIVINE WORKS OF FABRICATION

202
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,986
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT JMS

203
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,948
Based on what I know,

204
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,784
the director of external affairs,
a Korea Military Academy graduate,

205
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,078
had been with JMS for over 30 years.

206
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

207
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,416
Since 2010, it's been his job

208
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,253
to cover up
Jeong Myeong-seok's sex crimes.

209
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,842
Do not listen to, look at,
or read anything from our detractors!

210
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:14,431
God should punish those
who spread such outrageous lies.

211
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,185
I pray daily for God to bring justice
to people like them.

212
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,271
The director of external affairs

213
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,776
was on the phone with Jeong Jo-eun
in the Sejong office.

214
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,946
And the director said,

215
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,033
"Should we hire some gangsters
to deal with this?"

216
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,703
That's what he said to Jeong Jo-eun.

217
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,372
"Shouldn't we reach out to some gangsters

218
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,082
to take care of this?"

219
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,459
He said he felt he had to do it

220
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,171
out of a sense of martyrdom
for Pastor Jeong.

221
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,511
The Department of External Affairs
was desperate to know

222
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,891
exactly when Maple would arrive in Korea,
including the specific date and time.

223
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:06,817
INCHEON AIRPORT
FEBRUARY 2022

224
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,698
All the members were mobilized.
There were around 20 of us.

225
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,450
So many of us were there that day.

226
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,703
People were stationed at each gate.

227
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,415
We covered both the first
and second floors.

228
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,460
A group of elders
was waiting in a car outside

229
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,920
to tail and monitor her movements.

230
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,134
The director sat in the front seat
of the car assigned to tail her.

231
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,720
I was sitting in the back.

232
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,812
THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 25, 2022
MAPLE ARRIVES IN KOREA

233
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,823
Then we saw Maple board a bus
at the airport.

234
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,828
"Maple's out. Let's follow her."

235
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,372
That's what the director said.

236
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,090
I had no idea on the way to the hotel,

237
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:16,928
but later I found out
that someone was tailing us in a car.

238
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,641
They followed us from the airport
all the way to my hotel.

239
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,104
Later, when I looked out the window,

240
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,857
I saw a car parked on the street
and not moving.

241
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,778
After arriving at the hotel,

242
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,991
we ended up staying in the car
for about two days.

243
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,495
We were sitting in the car

244
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,916
when we suddenly felt
someone approaching from behind,

245
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,796
so I turned around
and saw Mr. Jo walking toward us.

246
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,426
You've been following us since yesterday
from Incheon Airport. Who are you?

247
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,263
And who are you in the back?

248
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,350
I was so shocked
I covered my face with my hand

249
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:08,856
and told the driver to go
and get us out of there immediately.

250
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,407
I also conducted

251
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,495
background checks on Mr. Jo Seong-hyeon
and Professor Kim Do-hyeong.

252
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,835
I leaked the personal information
of Professor Kim Do-hyeong's wife.

253
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,256
KIM DO-HYEONG, JO SEONG-HYEON

254
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,549
KIM'S ADDRESS, WIFE'S NAME

255
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,217
PHOTO/PROFILE/ADDRESS OF KIM'S WIFE

256
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,595
I understand
you were just following orders.

257
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,847
But that's a highly illegal act,

258
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,350
given how seriously
privacy is treated these days.

259
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,520
You're right.

260
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,939
And you followed them blindly?

261
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,068
I know it sounds stupid and foolish,

262
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,071
but I told myself,

263
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,616
"This can't be true.
Jeong Myeong-seok can't be that bad."

264
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,578
I kept convincing myself
he wasn't like that.

265
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,797
But Jeong Myeong-seok
sexually assaulted me.

266
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,267
Jeong Myeong-seok said this to me.

267
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,229
"Can you spread your legs
and have sex with me?"

268
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:39,363
When I finally understood the full truth,

269
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,201
the anger I felt was indescribable.

270
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,414
I blamed myself deeply and wondered,

271
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,461
"Can I go on with the rest of my life?"

272
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,755
Such fear came over me.

273
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,352
Thank you so much for teaching us.

274
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:17,276
THE DEFENDERS
OF MESSIAH WITH ELECTRONIC ANKLETS

275
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,029
We at Providence
have powerful organizations as well.

276
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,614
A team of lawyers.

277
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,742
Moreover, a group of police.

278
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,038
All these groups are involved
in different things, and...

279
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,374
2021
POLICE OFFICERS NEEDED IN JMS

280
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,417
INVESTIGATORS

281
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,376
DETECTIVES

282
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,544
WOMEN AND JUVENILE UNIT

283
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,670
LOCAL POLICE

284
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,714
TRAFFIC POLICE

285
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,589
NO MORE HIDING!

286
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,091
DEVOTE YOUR PASSION AND LOYALTY

287
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,594
BE A DEFENDER, NOT A PROTECTOR!

288
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,762
DI (DETECTIVES & INVESTIGATION) DEPARTMENT

289
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,516
The DI Department
refers to their police division.

290
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,185
Jeong Myeong-seok came up with the name,

291
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,604
and every police officer in JMS
at the time

292
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,733
was assigned to that department.

293
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,863
There are about 150 members
of the DI Department here today.

294
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,199
Everything the DI Department does

295
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,995
must serve the good of the Providence.

296
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,466
We believe this photo was taken
in the late '90s.

297
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,051
He's one of the worst sex offenders.

298
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,597
This is a photo of Jeong Myeong-seok,
a sexual predator, in the center,

299
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,266
surrounded by police academy graduates

300
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,353
and active-duty officers in uniform,

301
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,981
all kneeling around him.

302
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,400
What could this signify?

303
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,036
The police within the JMS church

304
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,789
protected and defended Jeong Myeong-seok,

305
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,875
whom they believed to be the Lord.

306
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,422
I believe JMS followers are everywhere.

307
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,469
National Intelligence Service,
the Board of Audit and Inspection,

308
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,012
along with military officers...

309
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,973
JMS followers are everywhere.

310
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,642
Are they all active members?

311
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,811
Yes, active members.

312
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,523
Do you know
who the head of the DI Department is?

313
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,026
The head at the time was Pastor Joo **.

314
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,446
The person in that nude video.

315
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,989
You mean the reporter video?

316
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,493
Yes, she was in the reporter video.

317
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,620
Come here, my Lord.

318
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,456
REPORTER VIDEO
FEATURING THE HEAD OF DI DEPARTMENT

319
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,792
You must be tired, my Lord.

320
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,211
Come and sit in the tub with us.

321
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,215
We'll make you
forget about your tiredness.

322
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,220
Have you ever gotten help
from the DI Department?

323
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,721
The DI Department?

324
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,056
Yes, a lot.

325
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,849
In what ways?

326
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,144
Following the Maple scandal,

327
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,273
we asked them to use
all their contacts in the police

328
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,151
to put a stop to Maple.

329
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,403
The lawyers

330
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,783
would organize the case relating to Maple.

331
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,829
Then, based on that,

332
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:20,499
I compiled and forwarded
a summary of the content

333
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,961
from a police officer's point of view.

334
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,547
PRESS CONFERENCE OF THE VICTIMS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY JMS LEADER

335
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,049
After Maple sued Jeong Myeong-seok
and held a press conference,

336
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,968
JMS held an internal Zoom meeting

337
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:35,347
with senior leadership
close to Jeong Myeong-seok.

338
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,933
The discussion focused
on how to stop the situation

339
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,896
and how to avoid turning over any evidence

340
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,192
related to Jeong Myeong-seok
during the investigation.

341
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,695
We held a meeting
to discuss how to handle the matter,

342
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,781
and active police officers also attended.

343
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:01,041
THE DI DEPARTMENT MEETING
WITH ACTIVE POLICE OFFICERS IN ATTENDANCE

344
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,420
Joo said his work
in an investigative division

345
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,130
meant he knew how this worked.

346
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:12,052
He essentially recommended
switching to a new phone

347
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,971
and shared what the police focus on
during an investigation,

348
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,390
among other things.

349
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,562
EXCERPT FROM THE SENTENCING OF CHOI,
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

350
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,856
JOO, JMS MEMBER
AND CURRENT POLICE OFFICER,

351
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,274
ATTENDED THE ONLINE MEETING.

352
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,568
HE CLAIMED TO KNOW A LOT
ABOUT THE POLICE WORK

353
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,572
AND EXPLAINED THE STANDARD PROCEDURE
FOR CELL PHONE FORENSICS

354
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,492
Joo Su-ho is a name

355
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,244
given to him by Jeong Myeong-seok.

356
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,453
JOO SU-HO

357
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,247
Joo Su-ho? Meaning "to defend God"?

358
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,332
I believe so.

359
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:52,133
CURRENT POLICE OFFICER
JOO SU-HO

360
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:59,598
The external hard drive we received
from the parents of a JMS spy

361
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,019
contained far more shocking content
than I ever expected.

362
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,690
One of them was the DI Department list.

363
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,275
JOO BIT-SEON

364
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,733
DI DEPARTMENT

365
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,651
JOO SU-HO

366
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,736
2021 SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM
STATEMENT CRITERIA

367
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,407
POLICE WILL SET CREDIBILITY CRITERIA
FOR THE VICTIM'S STATEMENT AS A KEY ISSUE

368
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,366
One notable document...

369
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,743
AND SEEK CIRCUMSTANTIAL
OR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE THAT MEETS IT

370
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,079
...was created by Joo Su-ho,
a member of the DI Department.

371
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,831
KNOWING YOUR ENEMY ENSURES VICTORY

372
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,709
The document detailed how to prepare
for future police investigations...

373
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,128
THIS COULD HELP COUNTER THE POLICE

374
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,963
CREDIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING VICTIMS
AND KEY EXAMPLES

375
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,507
...and what had to be destroyed
to leave no evidence.

376
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,592
It included a plan

377
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,262
for Pastor Jeong to escape
the looming police investigation.

378
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,222
VICTIM CHANGED HER STATEMENT
FROM ASSAULT TO RAPE

379
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,934
What broke my heart most
was reading the part

380
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:49,356
where they said they needed to paint Maple
as "a crazy bitch, a lunatic."

381
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,986
So they had a plan in place
to respond to her accusations.

382
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,321
PHONE CALL RECORDING OF JOO SU-HO

383
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,032
<i>We need a way to respond to that too.
Avoiding the issue won't help.</i>

384
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,660
<i>Our goal is to cloud the issue by calling
the details of the accusation psychotic.</i>

385
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,371
CALLING WITH A JMS OFFICIAL
AFTER MAPLE'S PRESS CONFERENCE

386
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,791
<i>We need to keep making the point
that she has psychological issues.</i>

387
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,876
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,213
<i>We need to be prepared
for a search and seizure as well.</i>

389
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,633
JOO SU-HO
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

390
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,135
JMS SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING EXCERPT
DECEMBER 4, 2018

391
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,264
JOO SU-HO AND OH'S COMMENT
"HAD DISCUSSION WITH WOLMYEONGDONG TEAM"

392
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,474
JOO SU-HO
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

393
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,976
JMS SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING EXCERPT
DECEMBER 18, 2017

394
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,145
REGARDING DETRACTORS' INTERVIEW
ON DECEMBER 24

395
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,981
JOO SU-HO: CHECK IF POLICE SHOULD ACT

396
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,441
JOO SU-HO

397
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,736
JMS SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING EXCERPT
DECEMBER 14, 2020

398
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,906
REGARDING THE APPEAL
AGAINST MBC'S "TRUE STORY"

399
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,409
ELDER JOO SU-HO TO MEET INVESTIGATOR
AND OFFER HELPFUL TIPS

400
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,828
We verified where he had worked.

401
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,833
We confirmed that he currently works
in the White-Collar Crime Unit

402
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,713
at Seoul Seocho Police Station
and serves as a team lead.

403
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,049
We first called him to say

404
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,386
we had come across
information concerning him.

405
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,765
We wanted to let him know
he had the right to refute our findings

406
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,477
and that we expected a rebuttal.

407
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,105
<i>Is this Mr. Kang **?</i>

408
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,690
<i>Who is this?</i>

409
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,235
<i>Are you Mr. Kang **? Mr. Joo Su-ho?</i>

410
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,445
<i>Who is this?</i>

411
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,116
<i>I'm Jo Seong-hyeon, a producer from MBC.</i>

412
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,995
<i>-Hello?
- Wrong number, I think.</i>

413
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,165
<i>What do you mean? I have the right--</i>

414
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,131
So I sent him a text explaining
we had specific information about him

415
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,215
and outlined the details.

416
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,009
DURING PRODUCTION OF SEASON 2,
MANY FORMER JMS MEMBERS,

417
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,262
ESPECIALLY THOSE
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS,

418
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,346
GAVE TESTIMONIES ABOUT YOU

419
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:47,015
YOU ORDERED THE DESTRUCTION
OF ALL EVIDENCE REGARDING MAPLE'S CASE

420
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,767
And the reply I got was, "Is this a scam?"

421
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,018
WHO IS THIS? IS THIS A SCAM??

422
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,105
He even added two question marks.

423
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,485
I contacted
Seoul Seocho Police Station twice

424
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:02,865
and explained, in detail,
what I was investigating and why.

425
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,118
Seoul Seocho Police Station said
they would reply,

426
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,329
but no response ever came.

427
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,666
I just couldn't understand,
so I went to the police station myself.

428
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,667
APRIL 24, 2024

429
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:17,171
FIELD COVERAGE OF WHITE-COLLAR CRIME UNIT,
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

430
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,547
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

431
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,341
- What brings you here?
- I'm from MBC. I called yesterday.

432
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,384
Who did you speak to?

433
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,430
- I called twice yesterday.
- So who did you speak to?

434
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,723
I think we spoke yesterday.

435
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,642
I contacted both *** and this unit.

436
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,604
- Please step outside.
- We're in the middle of an investigation.

437
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,023
Please leave. We're working.

438
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,108
Where is Mr. ***?

439
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,111
- Step outside.
- Where is Mr. ***?

440
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,862
I said step outside.

441
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,946
Why do I have to?

442
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,948
- We're busy.
- I've called several times.

443
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,868
Even yesterday, we explained our visit.
Now, where is...

444
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,872
- Where is Mr. ***?
- Step outside.

445
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,500
Can you confirm
if this is Mr. ***'s number?

446
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,168
This is Mr. ***, isn't it?

447
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,628
- Isn't it him?
- What?

448
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,672
Is this Mr. *** or not?

449
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,049
Is it him or not?

450
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,843
- That's not his face.
- Sorry?

451
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,139
They told me, "That's not his face.
No one like that works here."

452
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,894
While I was arguing with another officer,

453
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:18,274
I saw Joo Su-ho slip away
right before my eyes,

454
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,025
not then and there,

455
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:24,572
but later, when I reviewed the footage
back at the office.

456
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,574
Please leave. We're working.

457
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,911
- Where is Mr. ***?
- Step outside.

458
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,807
"They got me good." That's what I thought.

459
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,272
Mr. Joo Su-ho was a police officer

460
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,899
who I knew by his real name.

461
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,026
SON GU-MIN, JOURNALIST
COVERED JOO SU-HO

462
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,114
Since we'd known each other
for five years,

463
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,324
I started by asking,

464
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,411
"Aren't you being investigated
by the audit office?"

465
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,538
He was taken aback,

466
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,500
but then started talking.

467
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,717
<i>My wife still goes to that church,
even though I've told her not to.</i>

468
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,137
<i>And what's this name they call you,
"Joo Su-ho"?</i>

469
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:34,308
<i>I didn't even know about that,
since I don't go to the church.</i>

470
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,228
<i>But apparently,
that's what my wife calls me there.</i>

471
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,648
<i>Why would I use that name?</i>

472
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:46,194
<i>When they ask me something,
what else can I do?</i>

473
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,281
<i>I just briefly, in a personal capacity,</i>

474
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,076
<i>explained how we conduct investigations,</i>

475
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,369
<i>based only on what I know.</i>

476
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,871
<i>Just some obvious things.</i>

477
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,789
<i>Right.</i>

478
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>How is that helping to conceal evidence?</i>

479
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,711
<i>What do they want from me?</i>

480
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,255
<i>This is as much as I know.</i>

481
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,342
If he's not a follower,

482
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,053
why did he say he attended meetings
about concealing evidence?

483
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,930
Right, yes.

484
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,224
He couldn't really explain that part.

485
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:27,403
DENIAL

486
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,910
MAY 3, 2024

487
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,787
AS THE COVERAGE STARTED,

488
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,667
JOO SU-HO WAS TRANSFERRED
TO A LOCAL PRECINCT

489
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,797
- Hello.
- Hello.

490
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,549
Yes, hello. I'm from MBC.

491
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,426
I'm here to speak to ***.

492
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,680
I know he's here.
His car's in the parking lot.

493
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,685
- Mr. ***.
- Yes?

494
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,229
Here. Please answer me this.

495
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,355
- No.
- Hey.

496
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,148
- Are you here to report on me?
- Yes.

497
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,733
- Of course we are.
- No, I'm not--

498
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,652
Why did you lie to me last time?

499
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,946
<i>Is this Mr. ***?</i>

500
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,655
Let's step out.

501
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,909
Why did you lie and say you weren't ***?

502
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,369
Well?

503
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,953
Mr. ***.

504
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,038
- Mr. Joo Su-ho!
- I'm not Joo Su-ho.

505
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,665
- You're Joo Su-ho, aren't you?
- No.

506
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,083
- You're not Joo Su-ho?
- No.

507
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,379
Here, look. Isn't this you?
In Wolmyeongdong.

508
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,382
- You were with your daughters.
- Yes.

509
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:39,559
PHOTO TAKEN AT WOLMYEONGDONG,
JMS HEADQUARTERS

510
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,979
"Response plan
to counter Maple and Amy's case."

511
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,314
JOO BIT-SEON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR
OF DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

512
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,901
Did Joo Su-ho create this document too?

513
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:55,073
Yes, Joo Su-ho summarized the case

00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,347
- I'll explain everything.
- Go ahead.

524
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,433
- Okay.
- Right now.

525
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,018
- Why won't you explain anything?
- Mr. Jo.

526
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,686
- Please leave.
- No. Please explain.

527
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,146
- Later.
- Why later?

528
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,690
- I'll explain it to our agency.
- Why just them?

529
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,527
We're here for this story as well.
You can explain it to us.

530
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:37,784
"A police officer's viewpoint
on the Maple case and response strategy."

531
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,618
You didn't draft this?

532
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,786
No, I didn't.

533
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,579
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

534
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,747
- You don't know?
- No.

535
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,834
How could you not know?
Then why is your name on it?

536
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,924
Well? Who were you defending, Officer?

537
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,804
Did you defend the people?
Is Maple a criminal?

538
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,100
Why did you create a manual
for handling Maple's case?

539
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,686
Are you a JMS follower or not?

540
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,147
- I'm not.
- You're not?

541

Chungcheongnam-do, Korea.

544
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,496

JOO SU-HO
HEAD OF THE DI DEPARTMENT

547
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:50,356
Is there a way to identify a JMS follower?

548
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,942
There's this loyalty test we have to pass
at ex-member meetings.

549
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,861
YOON TAE-RIM
FORMER SECOND-GENERATION JMS MEMBER

550
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,656
We simply say,
"Jeong Myeong-seok is a son of a bitch."

551
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,077
Then try insulting Jeong Myeong-seok.
Go ahead.

552
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,663
Everyone else can do it.

553
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,587
You can't come in here. You can't...

At this rate, we'd be in serious trouble.</i>

<i>on the very day of the resurrection,</i>

560
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,208

00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,835
<i>The plaintiff is someone
in the United States.</i>

562
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:58,340
EXCERPT FROM THE SENTENCING OF CHOI,
DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

563
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,800
EXCERPT FROM REPORT ON NOVEMBER 13, 2021

564
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,803
JB LAWSUIT IN PROGRESS,
CURRENTLY THE BIGGEST THREAT,

565
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,557
STRONG-WILLED BUT VULNERABLE,
AFRAID OF HAVING IDENTITY EXPOSED

566
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,393
They called that woman JB,

567
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,939
which are her initials in English.

568
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,069
The woman known as JB was also a victim
of sexual assault by Jeong Myeong-seok.

569
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,572
So, in August 2021,

570
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,284
she initiated criminal proceedings
against Jeong Myeong-seok,

571
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,621
seven months prior to Maple's lawsuit.

572
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,123
She didn't tell anyone.

573
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,294
She went to the police alone
to file the complaint,

574
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:40,549
but later, a former JMS member said,
"I heard you sued Pastor Jeong."

575
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,387
She was stunned when she heard that.

576
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,805
She hadn't told anyone about it.

577
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,309
Who could have leaked it,
if not someone in the police?

578
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:53,895
MID-AUGUST 2021

579
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,356
JB SUES JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT

580
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,733
AT JONGNO POLICE STATION

581
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,901
SEPTEMBER 1, 2021

582
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,739
COMPLAINT TRANSFERRED
FROM JONGNO STATION TO GEUMSAN STATION

583
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:09,035
When JB filed the lawsuit,

584
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,830
there was a police officer
at Geumsan Police Station

585
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,248
who was a JMS follower,

586
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,961
and she received the complaint.

587
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,047
She was a police officer,

588
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,507
so I think she reported it

589
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,135
to the head of the DI Department,
the police division,

590
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,723
and the director of external affairs
also heard about it.

591
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,142
A COMPLAINT WAS FILED AGAINST PASTOR JEONG

592
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:37,898
They went to the place
where JB was staying.

593
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:47,575
I thought I had to stop it at all costs
before appealing to Pastor Jeong.

594
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,955
That's when I prayed the prayer of David,
followed by the prayer of Joshua.

595
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:58,753
Miraculously,
I helped her withdraw the lawsuit.

596
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,631
Every Monday at 8:00 p.m.,

597
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,634
the Department of External Affairs
held a meeting. At those meetings,

598
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,597
they said a JMS member at Geumsan Station
helped us find out just in time,

599
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,640
and in the end, everything worked out.

600
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,853
They said that God helped us.

601
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,607
As far as I know,
a female member named Im ♪

602
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,319
was working at Geumsan Police Station.

603
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,329
- Is this her?
- Yes, this is her.

604

APPOINTMENT OF DEDICATED POLICE OFFICER

605
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,584
- Is she a JMS follower?
- Yes, she is.

606
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,379
She had been appointed
as the officer in charge

607
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,965
of women and juvenile victims of violence.

608
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:49,178
I can't help but suspect
there's an ulterior motive.

609
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,889
It seems like a desire

610
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,768
to monitor all cases of abuse
against women in the area

611
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,687
and all instances
where people are victimized.

FOR WOMEN AND JUVENILE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE

614
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,614
Most of Jeong Myeong-seok's sexual abuse
took place in Geumsan.

615
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,616
If a sexual assault victim in Geumsan...

and the police officer assigned
by the center is also a JMS member,

621
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,512
then the moment
the survivor receives counseling there,

622
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,810
all of her information is reported to JMS.

Ms. Im worked at Geumsan Police Station

and when Chungnam Provincial Police Agency
started investigating Jeong Myeong-seok,

655
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,196
I'm not sure if she volunteered,

656
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,492
but she was transferred
to the Chungnam Provincial Police Agency.

657
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:17,992
Thankfully,

658
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,995
she was assigned to a different division

659
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,081
than the one
investigating Jeong Myeong-seok.

660
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:28,796

Jeong Myeong-seok
had already fled overseas

676

00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:56,550
when Jeong's ten-year prison sentence
was finalized in 2009.

680
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,605
In other words,
while serving as prosecutor general,

681
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,359
he charged Jeong with rape and assault

682
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,447
and carried the case through
until the ten-year sentence was confirmed.

683
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:22,450
Yet when that rapist was released
with an ankle monitor,

684
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:27,288
Im went all the way to Wolmyeongdong,
Seokmak-ri, Jinsan-myeon, Geumsan-gun,

685
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,166
way out in the country,
to meet that sex offender.

686
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,129
I don't think many people in this country
can understand why he did what he did.

687
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:39,717
Our production team contacted
former Prosecutor General Im Chae-jin,

688
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:43,304
showed his office the photo he took
with Jeong Myeong-seok,

689
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:46,099
and asked for an explanation.

690
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,517
TO: IM CHAE-JIN LAW OFFICE

691
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,519
WE WILL REPORT ON JMS'S SEX OFFENSE CASES

692
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,853
WE WISH TO HEAR FROM MR. IM

693
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,023
WE'RE FOLLOWING UP
AS WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU

694
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,068
And his response was...

695
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,237
WHY DID YOU MEET HIM,
AND WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

696
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,322
..."I'm currently a lawyer."

697
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,241
His main argument was,
"I'm a lawyer. I'm free to meet anyone."

698
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,160
ALL I DID WAS GIVE LEGAL COUNSEL
TO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED THEY WERE WRONGED

699
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,205
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS
I'VE TOLD YOU MANY TIMES

700
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,083
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS
BEFORE THE COUNSEL

701
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,919
AND I'VE NEVER MET HIM SINCE

702
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,255
I don't think it's possible
he didn't know who Jeong was

703
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,048
before meeting him.

704
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,884
While serving as chief prosecutor
at the Seoul District,

705
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,054
he was questioned several times
by assembly members

706
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,724
during an audit
over the Jeong Myeong-seok case.

707
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,018
To my recollection,
it's highly unusual for an audit

708
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,522
to focus on a single offender.

709
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,899
Jeong Myeong-seok
had already fled overseas

710
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,526
before we began our investigation.

711
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,654
Jeong Myeong-seok
had already fled overseas

712
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,782
before we began our investigation.

713
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,577
According to a reporter,

714
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,620
this is what Im Chae-jin said.

715
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,623
"Jeong Myeong-seok insists
he was wrongfully charged."

716
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:56,669
"And he couldn't move about freely
because of his ankle monitor."

717
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,424
"That's why I went all the way
to Wolmyeongdong to listen to his story."

718
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,262
To protect
their so-called returned Christ,

719
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,681
JMS followers in the prosecution
use their authority

720
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,392
to defend sex offender Jeong Myeong-seok,

721
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:15,564
while those in the police use theirs
to commit various illegal acts.

722
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,485
No wonder this guy treats Korean law
like a joke.

723
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:31,163
NEVER-ENDING BATTLE

724
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,666
Jeong Myeong-seok's lawyer told ours
he wanted to meet me

725
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,878
and asked him to arrange it.

726
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:44,008
That lawyer attended the same university
as the judges, including the chief judge,

727
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:48,597
trained with them in the same cohort,
and later served as a judge himself.

728
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:06,740
LAWYER FOR JMS'S APPEAL CASE
FORMER JUDGE

729
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:12,162
The leader turns 80 next year.

730
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:18,919
If he receives the same
or a similar sentence in the appeal,

731
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:24,716
everyone knows he'll die in prison.

732
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,717
Yes.

733
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,511
- But here's the problem.
- Yes?

734
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,307
If that happens, some church members

735
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,061
will have extreme, violent thoughts.

736
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,189
What are you trying to tell me?

737
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,899
To be honest, I'm worried.

738
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,442
You're worried about me?

739
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,153
That those violent followers
might seek revenge against me?

740
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,740
You, Professor,
and the other victims as well.

741
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,327
I don't think that's right.

742
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,959
The accused's lawyer says,

743
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,045
"This group of extremists
might do something."

744
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,797
"They could seek revenge on you."

745
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,634
If they say that to the victim,

746
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,471
who wouldn't take it as a threat?

747
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,808
So I said this.

748
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,811
"How about just letting this all go

749
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,356
and trying to reconcile with the victims?"

750
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,069
I said reconcile, not settle.

751
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,157
As you know, Professor,

752
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:36,288
settling out of court in a criminal trial
means the accused has to admit guilt

753
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,458
before any reconciliation can happen.

754
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,962
But members of religious groups

755
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,217
often can't acknowledge
their wrongdoing like that,

756
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,553
even if they want to.

757
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,347
You know that, right?

758
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,975
"To settle, Jeong would have to admit
that he had committed those crimes,

759
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:01,396
but that's impossible
because of the church members."

760
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,399
"So let's just reconcile instead."

761
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:09,403
In short, they offered money
for us to drop the lawsuit.

762
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,823
The moment I heard those words,

763
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,953
I felt so insulted
and incredibly offended.

764
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,330
So I told the lawyer,

765
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,500
"Even if you pay ten billion
for each victim,

766
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,044
we won't withdraw the suit."

767
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:40,310
SEOUL MAPO POLICE STATION
JUNE 10, 2024

768
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:54,031
Amid the flood of frivolous lawsuits
filed by JMS members,

769
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:58,620
they deliberately accused me of violating
the Special Act on Sexual Crimes.

770
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,789
You must be tired, my Lord.

771
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,208
Come and sit in the tub with us.

772
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,129
We'll make you
forget about your tiredness.

773
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,842
On the grounds
that I released this nude video.

774
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,551
The police deemed

775
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:19,390
the JMS video of their reporters
sexually exploitative.

776
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,476
I released that video
in the public interest,

777
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,979
but they treated it
as an act done for profit.

778
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,897
DOCUMENTARY EXPOSING JMS VIOLATED
NUDITY LAWS

779
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,526
At first, JMS claimed
the video was pornography

780
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,697
produced by Professor Kim Do-hyeong
using pornographic actresses.

781
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,742
Later, they abruptly changed their story
and claimed

782
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,663
the women were wearing underwear
and we blurred it to make them look nude.

783
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:48,712
So I released the unblurred footage
to prove they were lying.

784
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,797
We kept seeing minors being victimized.

785
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,175
If we don't show this,
how else can we warn the public?

786
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,260
USE OF NUDE VIDEO WITHOUT CONSENT
ARREST PRODUCER JO

787
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,470
INVESTIGATE PROF K!

788
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,516
VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14, PARAGRAPHS 2,3
OF SPECIAL ACT ON SEX CRIMES

789
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,185
Yes, I'm in this footage.

790
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,937
J, FORMER MEMBER
APPEARS ON REPORTER VIDEO

791
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,399
I'm one of the women
who appear in this video.

792
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,323
The release of that video

793
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,618
helped many victims of JMS...

794
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,369
I mean, potential victims.

795
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:28,876
It definitely helped potential victims
and ordinary members who weren't aware

796
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,463
to leave the cult.

797
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,717
There's only one reason I came forward.

798
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,849
JMS is a monster created
by Jeong Myeong-seok and its leaders.

799
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,853
I do this for those who've been exploited
but still don't know the truth,

800
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,608
and for those who may become
their next victims.

801
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,193
I pray you wake up to the truth,

802
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,028
leave the cult,

803
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,406
and find freedom.

JANUARY 9, 2025, SUPREME COURT'S
VERDICT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

811
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,283
- The press conference...
- It was around ten o'clock, wasn't it?

812
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,743
- Or was it 11:00?
- I think it was 11:00 or 1:00.

813
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,745
Maple, you had to go to the hospital.

814
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,998
- You threw up before we even left.
- Indeed.

815
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:49,958
I did.

816
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,253
- One o'clock.
- You were sitting there.

817
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,754
I was like...

818
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:57,883
Are you okay now?

819
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,551
- Are you feeling okay now?
- Yeah!

820
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,178
- Not gonna throw up?
- Throw up...

821
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,305
- In that alone, it's night and day.
- Yeah.

822
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,016
You're quite relaxed today.

823
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,853
Back then, on the way there,
I didn't think you could do the interview.

824
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,647
I mean, the press conference.

825
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,578
Maple, should we just go back?

826
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,414
Instead of going to the press conference?

827
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,541
- What should we do?
- No, I...

828
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,542
Sorry?

829
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,628
I need to do it.

830
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,261
There was a time
I wanted to give up on the trial.

831
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,846
I thought continuing the fight

832
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:52,062
would only leave me
repeatedly hurt and victimized.

833
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,898
I thought

834
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,275
about taking my own life.

835
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:02,822
I decided to do the right thing
before I died.

836
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,618
That's why I chose this path.

837
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,913
My mom found out

838
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,541
and begged me not to die...

839
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,216
saying that if I did,
she couldn't go on living either.

840
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,261
She told me not to die, no matter what.

841
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,222
To keep living,
no matter how hard it gets.

842
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:36,772
For one, there were no more victims.

843
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,150
I stopped further harm.

SUPREME COURT

- Maple.
- Yes?

847
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,216
The verdict?

848
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,844
- The appeal was dismissed.
- Appeal dismissed.

849
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,471
Confirmed, 17 years in prison.

850
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,932
Yes, 17 years confirmed.

851
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,600
Are you happy?

852
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,729
Finally, it's all over!

853
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:26,030
Of course, 17 years can't truly make up

854
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,992
for a decade of suffering

855
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,705
and the fight I endured.

856
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:39,753
But at least there won't be
any more victims.

857
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,635
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S 17-YEAR SENTENCE
WAS FINALIZED

858
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,806
2 YEARS AND 10 MONTHS
AFTER MAPLE FILED HER LAWSUIT

859
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,186
JEONG JO-EUN, HIS ACCOMPLICE,
WAS SENTENCED TO 7 YEARS IN PRISON

860
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:01,566
AND KEY FACILITATORS WERE ALSO PUNISHED,
INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

861
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:09,407
POLICE OFFICER JOO SU-HO
WAS REMOVED FROM HIS POSITION

862
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,744
OFFICER IM OF GEUMSAN POLICE STATION
CHANGED HER NAME

863
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,037
THE POLICE HAVE RESPONDED

864
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,291
THAT THEY HAVE NO PLANS
TO INVESTIGATE THE INFORMATION LEAK

865
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,421
REPORTEDLY, AFTER THE DOCUMENTARY,
THE JMS CONGREGATION CUT DOWN TO HALF

866
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:29,219
BUT THERE ARE STILL ESTIMATED TO BE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS WHO REMAIN

867
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,934
LA
FEBRUARY 2025

868
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,914
IN THE END, MAPLE SURVIVED

869
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,590
AND FOUND HAPPINESS IN HER EVERYDAY LIFE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE

870
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,012
WITH THE MAN WHO STOOD BY HER
DURING THE TOUGHEST TIMES OF HER LIFE

871
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,766
THESE WERE HER CLOSING REMARKS

872
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:21,895
"TO EVERY WOMAN OUT THERE
GOING THROUGH THE SAME PAIN AS ME"

873
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,398
"LET'S STAY STRONG"

874
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,151
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

875
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,447
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY
