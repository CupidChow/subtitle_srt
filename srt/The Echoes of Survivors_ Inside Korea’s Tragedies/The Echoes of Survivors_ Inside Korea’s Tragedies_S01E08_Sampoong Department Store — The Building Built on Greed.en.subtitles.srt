00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:10,927
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF A MAJOR DISASTER SCENE

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,164
I got a call around six o'clock.
"Professor, it's an emergency."

4
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,081
KIM SE-GYEONG

5
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,417
FORMER HEAD OF EMERGENCY DEPT.
AT GANGNAM ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,045
"The Sampoong Department Store collapsed.
Patients are pouring in."

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,258
It was just like a scene
from a zombie movie.

8
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:55,805
People were swarming in,
bleeding, crying, and screaming.

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,851
Don't come in!

10
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:06,900
Patients came in with hemorrhagic shock,
cardiac arrest, burst intestines…

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,486
There were people with severed limbs.

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:15,825
Blood covered the entire floor,
from the corridor to the treatment room.

13
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,953
If someone were missing a leg,
we'd contact people at the scene…

14
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,914
CHO YUN-MI, FORMER NURSE
AT GANGNAM ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL

15
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:27,545
…and ask if anyone could look for a leg
that might be lying nearby.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,467
Around a thousand patients
arrived at the ER

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,177
at Gangnam St. Mary's Hospital that day.

18
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:00,870
Dear me. What am I going to do?

19
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,623
Goodness me.

20
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,714
How can this happen?

21
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,054
LEE SEON-MIN
SAMPOONG COLLAPSE SURVIVOR

22
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,515
What I experienced back then
was absolute hell.

23
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:26,437
As a survivor, I've never once thought,
"I'm so glad I survived."

24
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,322
My family probably did
because they are my loved ones,

25
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,618
so if I had died back then,
they would have been in a lot of pain.

26
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,332
But as the person who went through it,
I wasn't all that happy about it.

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,334
Do you believe

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,421
you've lived well for those who died,
just as everyone wished?

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,048
I don't think so.

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,634
For about…

31
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,553
YOO JI-HWAN
SAMPOONG COLLAPSE SURVIVOR

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,554
…a year?

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,974
For about a year or a little longer,

34
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,103
I think I just let go of everything.

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,397
My mind wasn't all there.

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,524
I didn't want to live…

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,237
but I didn't want
to take my own life either.

38
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,285
I think that's how I felt back then.

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,454
So…

40
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,217
So back then…

41
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:27,433
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

42
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,204
JIN OK-JA
MOTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM JUNG CHANG-SUK

43
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:55,795
I think we went to karaoke
a few months before the accident in 1995.

44
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,592
Even after all this time,
her voice is still with me.

45
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,805
THE LATE JUNG CHANG-SUK

46
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,100
My daughter's name was Jung Chang-suk.

47
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:13,646
She lost her life
in the Sampoong Department Store collapse.

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,860
THE BABY STORE WHERE JUNG CHANG-SUK WORKED

49
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,822
I keep imagining her crying out for me
before she died.

50
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:35,335
SON SANG-CHEOL
BROTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM SON EUN-JU

51
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,336
People say

52
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,340
time heals the pain of losing loved ones.

53
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,133
You hope next year will be better.

54
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,385
But it's exactly the same.

55
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,596
You think, "Maybe the year after that?"

56
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,097
It's still exactly the same.

57
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,100
So

58
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,853
I think…

59
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,443
that was the hardest time of my life.

60
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,652
Even to this day.

61
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,881
JUNE 29, 2024
29TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAMPOONG TRAGEDY

62
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,648
It feels like just yesterday
I was trapped in that nightmare.

63
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,483
Thirty long years went by.

64
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,069
KIM DEOK-HWA, SON YEONG-SU
PARENTS OF SAMPOONG VICTIM SON GYEONG-A

65
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,987
But even now, she's still in my heart.

66
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,617
I always miss her,
long to see her, and feel deeply sorry.

67
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,996
I never knew the three syllables
of her name could carry so much sadness.

68
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,667
Even just thinking of her name
makes my heart ache.

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,920
SON GYEONG-A

70
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,440
She was my eldest daughter.

71
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,607
THE LATE SON GYEONG-A

72
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,986
You know, my daughter
was incredibly kind and gentle.

73
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,494
When I got to the scene,
it was more overwhelming

74
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,706
than I could have ever imagined.

75
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,208
It was on fire for days,

76
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,710
and it rained every day.

77
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,755
PRAYER VIGIL FOR VICTIMS OF THE COLLAPSE

78
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,965
So I…

79
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,634
A prayer room was set up there.

80
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,053
SO DO NOT FEAR, FOR I AM YOUR GOD
I WILL HELP AND UPHOLD YOU

81
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,139
So I prayed there, but at some point,

82
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,308
it started to feel selfish to be praying.

83
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,529
Because if she were alive under the ruins,
she'd be in so much pain.

84
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,239
So I started thinking

85
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,452
that if she was going to pass anyway…

86
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,080
I hoped she'd died in the fire

87
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,875
and turned to ashes
so she could finally rest.

88
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,049
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION GYM

89
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,968
WAITING AREA FOR FAMILIES
OF MISSING PERSONS

90
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,725
They'd call the missing person's family

91
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,853
to confirm the body that was found.

92
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,231
When people saw

93
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,359
someone pack their things to leave…

94
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,280
…they would say, "Congratulations."

95
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,281
LIST OF THE DECEASED

96
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,951
KIM MUN-SU
BROTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM KIM HAK-SU

97
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,954
Those who were leaving first would say,
"Sorry for leaving first."

98
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:03,793
So people who had just found
their children's bodies

99
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,004
were congratulated on the way out,

100
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,758
and everyone sincerely meant it.

101
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,680
"SORRY FOR LEAVING FIRST"

102
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,434
"CONGRATULATIONS"

103
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,562
He was found in the basement,

104
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,525
and there was no skin left on his face.

105
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,570
He was nearly a skeleton.

106
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,493
What I saw at that moment

107
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:44,000
wasn't a skeleton
but my kind little brother.

108
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,965
I felt gratitude

109
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,009
and

110
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,886
a sense of guilt.

111
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,014
I guess

112
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,642
it was a mixed feeling
of anger and regret.

113
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,768
THE LATE KIM HAK-SU

114
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,564
So I held him in my arms…

115
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,568
before I knew it.

116
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,838
5 DAYS SINCE SAMPOONG COLLAPSE

117
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:36,010
RAINY SEASON

118
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,138
Heavier rain is expected
this rainy season than last year's,

119
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,099
so thorough preparation
for rain damage is advised.

120
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:47,688
The Korea Meteorological Administration
expects heavy rainfall this year…

121
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,487
I had no idea

122
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,239
how much time had passed, but suddenly,

123
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,242
I heard the sound of water.

124
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:09,126
I wondered if I could drink it,
so I put my mouth under it…

125
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,089
but it tasted like rusty water.

126
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,513
To be honest, at the time,
I think I was fighting on my own.

127
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,142
"I might starve to death."

128
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,019
"I could be crushed to death."

129
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,106
When I felt okay,
I thought, "I can survive this."

130
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,440
Other times,

131
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,360
"I'm going to die."

132
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,825
No one could have survived.

133
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,037
With all that water spraying
and the excavator digging,

134
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,497
even a survivor would die.

135
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,961
The news reported ongoing rescue efforts,

136
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,383
but it was strange because I saw
nothing happening at the scene.

137
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,426
Stop pushing!

138
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,636
Why are you telling us to stop pushing?

139
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,222
Don't be rough with him!

140
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,434
What the hell did you say?

141
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,563
Let go! Just kill me, you assholes!

142
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,648
-Sir, please calm down.
-I said just kill me!

143
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,983
Bring me my daughter!

144
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,028
You can't even rescue anyone, huh?

145
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,323
You people arrived two hours
after the media.

146
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,867
We were here before you!

147
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,327
What the hell is this crap?

148
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,420
Seriously,

149
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,173
it was… I mean…

150
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,759
I was just devastated.

151
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,886
JUNG GAK-HYEON, FORMER RESCUE TEAM
SEOCHO FIRE STATION

152
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,014
It was so heart-wrenching
that I remember it to this day.

153
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,850
As the search for survivors progressed,

154
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,561
we also began recovering bodies.

155
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,483
We found a mother's body
and began recovering it.

156
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,238
Then we found something else.
The body of a small child beneath hers.

157
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,784
It must have been
around two or three years old.

158
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:14,084
She was leaning forward,
protecting the child beneath her belly.

159
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:20,007
So the child was somewhat shielded
from all the concrete.

160
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,010
As for the mother… I mean,

161
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,889
she was crushed so badly
that it was hard to even identify her.

162
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,643
But thanks to the mother,
the child's body was somewhat intact.

163
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,185
10 DAYS SINCE SAMPOONG COLLAPSE

164
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,567
All right. Lift the legs.

165
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,484
Wrap it up.

166
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,527
Lift it up more.

167
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,987
Wrap it with this.

168
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,989
Move. Pouring water will make it stink.

169
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,575
-Yeah. That's fine.
-It's fine. Just wrap 'em up!

170
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,827
-Wrap the body up.
-Cover it.

171
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,079
-Come on, let go.
-We're done moving them.

172
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,539
-It's fine.
-Okay.

173
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,915
Cover it now.

174
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,544
Lift it up.

175
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,212
Lift it higher!

176
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:46,969
I had never seen bodies decay like that.

177
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,141
They had gotten so mushy,
you couldn't even recognize them.

178
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,436
We put them in the body bags we'd brought,

179
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,981
using only rubber gloves as our tools.

180
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,650
We'd put those on, gathered the remains,

181
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,611
and put them in the bag.

182
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:10,993
Honestly, I was scared.
It was truly horrifying work.

183
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,789
DECEASED INFORMATION

184
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,668
After a week, and then ten days,

185
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,463
more victims' bodies were discovered.

186
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,886
The count rose to 100, then 200, then 300.

187
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,013
The numbers just kept climbing.

188
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,266
I thought,
"This could reach into the thousands."

189
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:41,357
DEATH TOLL

190
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,404
We were recovering only the deceased,
no survivors.

191
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,449
And that definitely discouraged everyone.

192
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,796
No matter how hard we tried,
we found zero survivors.

193
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,090
But then…

194
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:16,642
ALIVE

195
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,273
Take one step back.

196
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,904
The unit commander suddenly radioed

197
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,532
that they couldn't see anyone
but did hear a voice.

198
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,993
GYEONG GWANG-SUK, FORMER RESCUE TEAM
DOBONG FIRE STATION

199
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:38,831
I was told to move
to the first basement level right away.

200
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,165
Someone was in there.

201
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,209
Can you hear me?

202
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,128
Can you hear me?

203
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,507
I said, "Can you hear me?"
and they said they could.

204
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,345
I asked what their name was,
and the survivor answered very clearly.

205
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,435
I rushed over to the central command
and informed them.

206
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,894
"We got a survivor."

207
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,397
"Male. Choi Myeong-seok."

208
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,911
He's coming out. Keep quiet.

209
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,288
-A bit more.
-Don't go in.

210
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,375
Please quiet down.

211
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,838
Get him up!

212
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,590
-Don't do that!
-Get him up.

213
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:36,722
11 DAYS SINCE SAMPOONG COLLAPSE
CHOI MYEONG-SEOK IS RESCUED

214
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,848
Grab the handle.

215
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,517
This morning,
a survivor was miraculously rescued

216
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,563
from the wreckage
of the Sampoong Department Store.

217
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,649
Twenty-year-old Choi Myeong-seok
was working part-time

218
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,402
at a store in the basement
when the building collapsed.

219
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,155
At 6:30 a.m. today,
after being trapped for 11 days,

220
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,241
he was found by the rescue team
and freed from the fear of death

221
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,286
following an hour and 40 minutes
of rescue efforts.

222
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,830
You survived miraculously.

223
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,168
Do you think there might be
other survivors like you?

224
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,586
I think there are.

225
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,004
Why do you think that?

226
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,881
It's just a feeling I have.

227
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:17,971
I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE'S CONCERN
CHOI MYEONG-SEOK

228
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,098
"Hang on."

229
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,268
"If this gentleman survived
and managed to pull through,

230
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,980
there might be more survivors.
Another Choi Myeong-seok."

231
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,317
After Choi Myeong-seok was rescued,

232
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,403
whenever we found
even the tiniest opening,

233
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,281
we called out to see if anyone was inside,

234
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,826
hoping for more survivors.

235
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,880
That's when I heard people.

236
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,645
I could hear them talking on the radio.

237
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,231
I began hearing it from a distance.

238
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,607
Then someone asked

239
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,735
if anyone was there.

240
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,029
Like, "Is anybody in there?"

241
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,866
So I responded,

242
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,868
but they didn't hear me.

243
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,786
So…

244
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,042
I think that's when I knocked
on the wall or something.

245
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,920
I was trying to make some sort of noise.

246
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,550
And they were saying,
"There's someone in here."

247
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,643
Let's go in this way.

248
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,899
And suddenly, I saw a hole near my feet.

249
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,575
I saw the foot move!

250
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,663
That's when they asked for my information.

251
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,583
I said, "My name's Yoo Ji-hwan,

252
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,084
I'm 18,

253
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,046
and I live in Suyu-ri."

254
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,215
RESCUE IN PROGRESS
FOR SURVIVOR YOO JI-HWAN

255
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,343
We've confirmed the identity
as 19-year-old Yoo Ji-hwan.

256
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,261
Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan, 19 years old.

257
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:28,810
The person you are seeing on the screen
is Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan.

258
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,903
Due to the high risk of injury
to Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan,

259
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:42,950
rescuers are manually securing space,
centimeter by centimeter.

260
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,790
It was so chaotic outside.

261
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,086
I could hear their entire exchange
over the radio.

262
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,215
They were saying
it would be difficult to rescue me.

263
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
So I asked him.

264
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,846
I said, "Mister, will I live?"

265
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,473
And what did he say?

266
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,560
That I will.
To wait a little longer for the rescue.

267
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,945
Honestly, at that moment, I thought,
"Even if I die, I can rest easy now,"

268
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,114
since they knew who I was.

269
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,411
Hey! Get her up!

270
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:31,790
I had held on this long,
so I felt like it was enough.

271
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,420
Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan
is now slowly being brought out

272
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,842
to the place of light,
back into the world of the living.

273
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,389
You are watching Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan's rescue.

274
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,646
Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan was miraculously rescued

275
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,983
from the narrow space
where she was trapped

276
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,612
and is now being carried to the ambulance
by the rescue team.

277
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,908
Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan was miraculously rescued…

278
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,826
No pictures!

279
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,745
…285 hours after the accident.

280
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:21,548
I was found on July 11,
meaning I was rescued

281
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,134
on the 13th day after the incident.

282
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,888
13 DAYS SINCE SAMPOONG COLLAPSE
YOO JI-HWAN IS RESCUED

283
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,308
YOO JI-HWAN, AN 18-YEAR-OLD MIRACLE

284
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,186
ANOTHER MIRACLE
MS. YOO JI-HWAN'S SURVIVAL

285
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,689
IT FELT LIKE I DOZED OFF FOR A WEEK

286
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,858
-Please tell us how you feel.
-Thrilled.

287
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,319
CHEON SEOK-GI, RESCUE TEAM LEADER
YEONGDEUNGPO FIRE STATION

288
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,279
This is why we do this,
and it makes us proud.

289
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,698
Let's go, Yeongdeungpo!

290
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,575
Let's go, Yeongdeungpo!

291
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,166
She was conscious when she…

292
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,294
The applause.

293
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,257
The way the public celebrated
and applauded us

294
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,677
truly gave us a boost of strength.

295
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:13,350
We were completely worn out,
but that really gave us strength.

296
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,061
Now, the parents…

297
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,188
Director.

298
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,649
If we could just get her name…

299
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,318
You must have been
really hungry and thirsty.

300
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,861
How did you cope?

301
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,030
I screamed.

302
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,156
She says she screamed.

303
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,867
Did you try drinking your own urine
when you got thirsty?

304
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,370
Try it yourself. It's impossible.

305
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,621
Was it impossible?

306
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,044
Good evening, everyone.

307
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,172
Another miracle occurred
at the site of the collapse.

308
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,759
Today, 17 days
after the Sampoong collapse,

309
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,637
Ms. Park Seung-hyeon, the third survivor
and just 19 years old…

310
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
MIRACULOUSLY RESCUED AFTER 17 DAYS

311
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,807
…returned to us safe and sound.

312
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:04,526
The meeting between the two girls,
whose survival gave us immeasurable joy,

313
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,864
was an emotional moment unlike any other.

314
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,741
I was in the children's wear section.

315
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,871
-Do you know who this is?
-Yes, I do.

316
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,581
Yes, I think so.

317
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,502
When were you rescued?

318
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:28,925
That filled me with immense hope.

319
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,386
These kids actually made it out alive.

320
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,687
We got a call at home.

321
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,983
It was a call for my father.

322
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,320
They told us they had found her,
so I thought that meant she was alive…

323
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,404
WE FOUND HER

324
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,947
…but…

325
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,589
She was listed as unidentified.

326
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,094
Because her remains
couldn't be recognized.

327
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,599
But her hand was still intact.

328
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,895
I think she was flattened like this…

329
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,691
by the concrete slab,

330
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,237
like a pancake.

331
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,872
There were reports that another survivor
besides Park Seung-hyeon had been found,

332
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,708
but upon verification,
no additional survivor was found.

333
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,672
Contrary to our hopes,
no other survivors were found.

334
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:59,266
Almost none of the other girls I was with
at the time managed to survive.

335
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,434
I also sometimes wonder

336
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,939
how I managed to get out of there alive.

337
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,985
I also thought about it a lot
after I got out.

338
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,530
"What happened?"

339
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,199
"How does something like this happen?"

340
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,371
GROSS NEGLIGENCE

341
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,083
Did a building that stood solidly
for five years just collapse?

342
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:30,589
No, the building didn't just stand firm
for five years and then suddenly collapse.

343
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,384
Structural deformation accumulated
over those five years.

344
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,472
That building was bound to collapse.

345
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,481
I talked to him on the phone
two days before the incident,

346
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,610
and he mentioned
hearing a noise in the ceiling.

347
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,448
There were partial power outages.

348
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:04,998
He told me several times
that the department store might collapse.

349
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,500
The key evidence

350
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,589
was a column we found
at the Nanjido Landfill.

351
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,260
According to structural calculations,

352
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,513
the columns should have been
80 cm in diameter,

353
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,100
but the columns we found at the scene
were only 60 cm in diameter.

354
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,518
ACTUAL DIAMETER: 60 CM

355
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,480
DIAMETER ON THE PLANS: 80 CM

356
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:36,780
And the columns were supposed to be
reinforced with 16 rods of rebar,

357
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:41,618
but as you can see here,
there are only eight.

358
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,244
It's about half.

359
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,748
REBARS ON THE PLANS: 16

360
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,833
ACTUAL NUMBER OF REBARS: 8

361
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:54,255
As a luxury department store,
they wanted it to look open and spacious.

362
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,760
Certain structures require support frames,
but they wanted them removed.

363
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,847
Repeated requests to remove certain parts
shaped the final product.

364
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,643
And when the building was rezoned,

365
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,230
they didn't change much in Building B,

366
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,982
but they made a lot of alterations
to Building A.

367
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:19,656
We specialize in making
these building frameworks.

368
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,826
Things like columns,
retaining walls, and slabs.

369
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,246
Looking into the cause,

370
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,207
I actually counted the rebar strands.

371
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,670
I counted every one of them precisely.
Even after 30 years, I still can't forget.

372
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,382
I wondered what kind of insane people
would do something like this.

373
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,221
I was absolutely speechless
that they had skipped rebar like this.

374
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,975
It was faulty construction for sure.

375
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:59,654
We gathered statements
from both the store staff who escaped

376
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,949
and people involved in the construction.

377
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:08,455
They told us about the emergency meeting
and where it was held.

378
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,334
4 HOURS BEFORE COLLAPSE

379
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,628
EXEC. MEETING 4 HOURS BEFORE COLLAPSE

380
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,088
They obviously held a meeting,

381
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,009
aware of the signs
that the building was about to collapse.

382
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:27,223
There was a big whiteboard in that room.

383
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:34,314
They had marked areas on it
that showed signs of collapse,

384
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,149
where pieces of concrete had fallen.

385
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,570
They wrote "Stay open or close?"
and marked O's and X's.

386
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,656
STAY OPEN
CLOSE

387
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,367
If the owners had even the slightest idea

388
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,329
that the building was showing
signs of collapse…

389
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,413
STAY OPEN

390
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,998
it would be gross negligence.

391
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:56,211
MEETING DECISION
KEEP CONFIDENTIAL AND CONTINUE OPERATIONS

392
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,837
REPAIR AFTER CLOSING TODAY

393
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,217
That's as bad
as deliberately committing murder.

394
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,719
RISK OF COLLAPSE WAS KNOWN

395
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,473
If they had just closed early,
they could have saved all those lives…

396
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,433
SCREAMS FOR HELP IN LIVING HELL

397
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,894
and avoided the financial loss as well.

398
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,773
One person's poor judgment
amplified the damage.

399
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,317
FREQUENT EXTENSIONS
CAUSED STRUCTURAL FATIGUE

400
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,238
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

401
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,242
Come on.

402
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,416
"What did I do wrong
for you to come and arrest me?"

403
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,501
THE LATE LEE JUN

404
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,962
CHAIRMAN OF THE SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE
AT THE TIME

405
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,630
MAJOR CRIMES UNIT 3

406
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,551
Why did you bring him here?
I thought he was being questioned.

407
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,972
Your employees told us

408
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,225
that serious signs of collapse began
about ten days ago.

409
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,270
-There is a CEO.
-Right.

410
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,855
The CEO is in charge.

411
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:03,736
And I only attend meetings
once a week as the chairman.

412
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,280
But the technical director says

413
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,032
he pointed out the risks
during the meeting.

414
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,117
Look here.

415
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,953
If a building collapses,

416
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,582
it's not only the customers who get hurt.

417
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,711
It would also damage
the company's property.

418
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,171
We'll wrap up after that.
Please say a few words.

419
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,425
He never even lowered his head.
Totally stiff-necked.

420
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,719
His arrogance was beyond words.

421
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,637
I felt the urge

422
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,892
to punch him and say,
"Have you lost your mind, old man?"

423
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,353
CIVIL SERVANTS AIDED AND ABETTED

424
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,440
COLLUSION BETWEEN SAMPOONG
AND CIVIL SERVANTS

425
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,484
DID NOT MEET STANDARDS
ILLEGAL EXTENSIONS, FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS

426
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,779
There is no way
civil servants weren't involved in this.

427
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,449
The Sampoong Department Store management

428
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:54,495
colluded with relevant officials
from the Seocho-gu Office,

429
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,831
which had jurisdiction over the store,

430
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,208
involving connections and bribery.

431
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,630
CIVIL SERVANTS GO INTO HIDING

432
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,050
The civil servants in supervision
are always the first to disappear

433
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,719
whenever major incidents take place.

434
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,638
This incident was no exception.

435
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,600
All nine civil servants involved
from the Seocho-gu Office fled

436
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,851
after the incident.

437
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,728
First thing in the morning,

438
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,900
we went there to look for those
involved in the case,

439
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,819
but it was as if the building
was abandoned.

440
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,738
No one had come in that day.

441
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,492
My detectives came back and said,

442
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,993
"They all ran off."

443
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,665
So we were unable to obtain statements
from any of the civil servants.

444
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,876
They went into hiding.

445
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,841
The civil servants who fled
after the Sampoong collapse

446
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,010
are now wanted by police.

447
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,562
Lee Seung-gu served
as director of urban redevelopment

448
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,233
at the Seocho-gu Office
from March 1989 to July 1990.

449
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,195
He is suspected of illegally issuing
rezoning and interim use permits

450
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,282
in exchange for a total bribe
of ten million won over two occasions.

451
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,077
They are skillfully evading capture,

452
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,497
but unlike other cases,
public tips have been lacking,

453
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,208
making it hard to catch the suspects.

454
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,128
I think it was all about money.

455
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,424
Lee Jun, the chairman,
acted that way because of money.

456
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,635
The civil servants who took bribes
did so for the money.

457
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,722
Same goes for the person
who issued the permit.

458
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,766
Would they have done that
if it weren't for money?

459
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:44,313
For these people,
money was far more important than people.

460
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,108
I mean, where does greed even end?

461
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:55,116
MONEY OVER PEOPLE

462
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,674
We're seeing many shameless looters

463
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,344
posing as volunteers at the collapse site.

464
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,850
When I first heard

465
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:25,021
that they had arrested a looter
at the scene,

466
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,981
I couldn't believe it.

467
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,652
The Sampoong Department Store
sold many expensive items,

468
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,822
and some people openly admitted

469
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:39,327
that they thought they could steal
cash or checks if they went to the scene.

470
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,499
-Go on.
-Just wait.

471
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,583
Go slowly.

472
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,168
Wait. Slow down.

473
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,670
Slow down.

474
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,341
We cracked down
on almost 800 cases of looting.

475
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,928
Get a move on, punk.

476
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,349
Sit on the chair.

477
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,102
On the chair. Hey, you!

478
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,150
I saw a lady there.

479
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,613
Looking back, she was carrying

480
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,407
a bunch of fur coats.

481
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,118
I mean,

482
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:25,581
I didn't think much of it at the time,
but in hindsight, she was stealing them.

483
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,547
I thought they weren't even human.

484
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,091
I want to ask them if they're happy.

485
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,011
With the money they stole, I mean.

486
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,060
ONE MONTH AFTER SAMPOONG COLLAPSE

487
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,148
It's been a month since
the Sampoong Department Store collapsed.

488
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,819
Now that 34,000 tons of debris
have been cleared,

489
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,446
they are working
to recover the merchandise.

490
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,331
By the 25th day,
all rescue efforts had effectively ended.

491
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,749
But then,

492
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,585
all of a sudden,

493
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:16,048
the families of the victims
whose bodies hadn't been recovered

494
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,511
lay down in front of the rescue teams
as they tried to leave.

495
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,263
They said, "No."

496
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,974
I'm gonna kill them.

497
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,856
Those sons of bitches,
telling the volunteers to leave.

498
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,983
If the rescuers were leaving,

499
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:38,237
it meant they wouldn't be doing
any more work at the scene.

500
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,407
So they were asking
how they would ever find their loved one.

501
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,660
The families of the missing victims knew

502
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,997
the debris had been dumped
at the Nanjido Landfill.

503
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,084
So they went to the Nanjido Landfill
and searched for the belongings

504
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,670
of their family member.

505
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,173
But did they just find their belongings?

506
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,299
No.

507
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,053
No one thought
there could be bodies or remains there.

508
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,805
They were so focused
on clearing the scene quickly

509
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,809
that they loaded everything
onto the trucks and dumped it there.

510
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,856
Those huge trucks dumped everything
at the Nanjido Landfill.

511
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,737
So the mothers went there
hoping to find traces of their children.

512
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,865
People went there, day after day,
to search for anything they could find.

513
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,950
NANJIDO LANDFILL

514
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,621
We took turns going there every day.

515
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,499
Every time they dumped debris.

516
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,214
We dug around the piles with a hoe,
hoping we'd find something.

517
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,760
We cleared the rocks
to look for bone fragments.

518
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,764
We took hoes and similar tools,

519
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,266
knocked the rocks aside,

520
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,601
and looked for anything
that might be bone fragments.

521
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,816
Some people found only a hand,

522
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,110
while others found only a foot.

523
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:03,531
Someone found only a finger
and held a funeral with it.

524
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,701
One of the bones we found
belonged to our daughter.

525
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,296
Nothing we could recognize her by.

526
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,882
They ran DNA tests
using my blood and the two kids'.

527
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,886
They told us the bone was hers,
so we accepted it.

528
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,807
-We couldn't tell.
-It was hard to believe the test.

529
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,602
Now that I think about it,
I believe it was her arm.

530
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:38,190
It was just like a cut of meat
at the butcher's.

531
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,696
There were no fingers, no toes. Nothing.

532
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,114
It was just…

533
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,201
like a piece of meat.

534
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,832
Did you not find
a single part of her body?

535
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,208
I found nothing.

536
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,630
My daughter was one of the missing.

537
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,758
One of the 31 who weren't found.

538
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,387
There was nothing.

539
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,603
I saw nothing.

540
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
NANJIDO NOEUL PARK

541
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,041
Later on, I began to envy
those who found a body.

542
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:46,467
I thought she must have really hated me,
keeping me from seeing her body

543
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,010
or even a trace of her.

544
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,597
That I must have been a bad mother.

545
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,677
937 INJURED

546
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,887
502 DECEASED

547
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:36,225
31 BODIES NOT FOUND

548
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,113
THE COST OF SURVIVAL

549
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,366
-The Sampoong Department Store.
-Yes.

550
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,662
The three survivors,
Mr. Choi Myeong-seok, Ms. Yoo Ji-hwan,

551
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,123
and Ms. Park Seung-hyeon
are joining us today.

552
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,795
I'd never been through anything like that.

553
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,213
THE SAMPOONG MIRACLE TRIO

554
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,508
Being interviewed, appearing on TV…

555
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,677
YOO JI-HWAN

556
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,639
SPECIAL GUESTS!
YOO JI-HWAN, PARK SEUNG-HYEON

557
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,641
At first, I didn't see anything wrong.

558
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,227
I guess I was just going with the flow
back then.

559
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,649
I saw it as a way to repay the public
for their support and care.

560
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,527
But…

561
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,824
at some point,
it started to feel like a burden.

562
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,954
The three of you should always remember

563
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,458
that you're living for everyone
who was there.

564
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,920
You must strive
to be your best selves and succeed.

565
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,631
The two, I mean the three of you,
will go down in history.

566
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,258
-Right.
-Things will go well from now on.

567
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,720
You'll never see another bad day.

568
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,516
The rest of us
will watch you live your lives

569
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,684
and be inspired by you.

570
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,063
I was simply a victim
of an unexpected incident.

571
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,067
I'm just an ordinary person

572
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,531
who somehow managed to hold out
and make her way out of there.

573
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,992
But I became someone

574
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,163
who wasn't allowed to make any mistakes.

575
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,335
Everyone asked
how much compensation I got.

576
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,255
"Hey, you won the lottery."

577
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,634
They told me I won the lottery.

578
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,553
LOTTO
SPORTS TOTO

579
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,679
And what else did they say?

580
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,597
"You're set for life."

581
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,229
In accidents like this, compensation
is the first thing people bring up.

582
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,897
Compensation.

583
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,360
They put money before life, saying,

584
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,364
"We'll compensate you well."

585
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,032
"Is this all about money?"

586
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,953
Those words crush us completely.

587
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,876
Money is meaningless. I mean,

588
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,756
if God offered
to bring my brother back to life

589
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,633
for ten times the compensation I got,

590
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,136
I would ask for him back immediately,

591
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,597
even if it meant I'd be in debt

592
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,725
for the rest of my life.

593
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,269
I mean,

594
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:31,358
who would trade a life for money?

595
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,325
Thank you.

596
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,336
Why did you agree to the interview?

597
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,881
At first, I had no intention of doing it.

598
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,177
Well, it's been so long already,

599
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,679
and bringing it up again

600
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,435
to think about that situation
isn't really something I want to do.

601
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,605
My appearance here as a survivor

602
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,109
might hurt the families of victims
who didn't make it,

603
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,780
reminding them of their own children.

604
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,032
You see,

605
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,660
looking back on the incident

606
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,496
is extremely difficult.

607
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:32,753
But I agreed to do this interview because…

608
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:38,008
Because if we don't,
everyone in Korea will just forget.

609
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,761
They always do.

610
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,391
Please help spread this,
even if it's a hassle.

611
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,065
Some people might say,

612
00:44:54,483 --> 00:45:00,531
"After the Sampoong Department Store
collapsed, killing all those people,

613
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,283
could it happen again?"

614
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,868
But…

615
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,331
Yesterday afternoon,
the exterior wall of a building collapsed

616
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,710
at an apartment complex construction site
in Gwangju.

617
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,921
When the apartment building
in Gwangju collapsed…

618
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,968
and I saw the pictures on TV,

619
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,847
it looked just like the Sampoong collapse.

620
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,851
That was just last year.

621
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,062
That's the "Boneless Apartment" incident
from last year.

622
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,274
Upon investigating all apartments
commissioned by LH,

623
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:39,027
it was found
that 15 other complexes lacked rebar.

624
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,990
They forgot what happened 30 years ago.

625
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,283
They completely forgot.

626
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,994
It's enough to drive you mad.

627
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,302
THE SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE
WAS FULLY DEMOLISHED ON JANUARY 30, 1999

628
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:16,690
RESIDENTS OPPOSED TO A MEMORIAL PARK
OVER PROPERTY VALUE FEARS

629
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,320
OF ALL THE PERPETRATORS,
INCLUDING CIVIL SERVANTS,

630
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:25,699
LEE JUN RECEIVED THE LONGEST SENTENCE
OF 7 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS IN PRISON

631
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,914
THE SAMPOONG SITE NOW HOLDS

632
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:36,251
A HIGH-RISE MIXED-USE BUILDING,
NOT A MEMORIAL

633
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:44,676
I don't think the Sampoong tragedy
has ever truly ended in Korean society.

634
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,263
I believe it keeps repeating
in different forms,

635
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,849
in different places,
and under different names.

636
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,684
JINDO, APRIL 2014

637
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,603
It was the same with the Sewol ferry.

638
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,731
They overloaded the ferry for money,
out of greed.

639
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,734
And the civil servants allowed it again.

640
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,780
And the flooding of the Osong underpass.

641
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,114
OSONG, JULY 2023

642
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,494
We are constantly met with incidents
that keep reminding us

643
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,580
of the Sampoong Department Store.

644
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:18,252
MUAN, DECEMBER 2024

645
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,215
We should never forget those disasters.

646
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,218
And to those who lost their child…

647
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,471
Do you think

648
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,349
this is really in the past for them?

649
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,396
Do you think you could die at any moment?

650
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,860
Yes.

651
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,450
I do think so.

652
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,873
Nothing would be surprising at any time,
especially here in South Korea.

653
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,980
OVER THE PAST 45 YEARS,
58 SUCH TRAGEDIES HAVE OCCURRED IN KOREA

654
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:26,278
WE ARE ALL SURVIVORS

655
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:31,301
