00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:10,969
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF A MAJOR DISASTER SCENE

2
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,400
It was pitch black.

4
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,779
It was just like an underground cave.

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,199
Nothing was visible.

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,203
It smelled like a construction site, and…

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:43,126
I had never smelled
such an intense smell of blood before.

8
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,970
It just felt like being in a grave.

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,932
The wall was right in my face,

10
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,726
close enough to touch.

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,522
I was like,
"What's this? What's going on?"

12
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,234
It kept closing in, coming down on me.

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,449
It meant I'd have to feel
my own flesh ripping open.

14
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,910
That was the scariest part.

15
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,833
JUNE 29, 1995

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,505
Today, on June 29th, one of Korea's
biggest premium department stores

17
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,257
collapsed in an inexplicable accident.

18
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,510
I mean, it was just utter chaos.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,597
They were soaked in blood, head to toe.

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,852
Everyone's face was frozen in pure shock.

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,979
People covered in dust,

22
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,732
bleeding, with arms severed…

23
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:51,361
People in those conditions
just started flooding out of there.

24
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,124
I thought, "Was there a bombing?"

25
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,041
"Or

26
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,294
was it a gas explosion?"

27
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,924
The whole building collapsed with a boom,
right before our eyes.

28
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,469
All of Building A was gone.
Every last bit of it.

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,315
Arms were hanging over the debris,

30
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,903
while ankles were scattered everywhere.

31
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,033
Those images linger in your mind.

32
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,954
The image of the scene remains vivid.

33
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,007
The flash went off as I pressed
the shutter with my eyes open.

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,467
What I saw at that moment was…

35
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,431
Within seconds, I turned off the flash
because what I saw was too horrific.

36
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:49,771
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:58,488
Experts say our economy is on the verge
of a boom after a prolonged recession.

38
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:07,956
By 1996, an additional 2.5 million
affordable housing units will be provided.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,252
As of the end of last month,

40
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,130
the number of high-end domestic sedans
with engines over 2.5 liters in Seoul

41
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,882
have risen more than tenfold.

42
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,763
Today, Korea has formally submitted
its application to join the OECD,

43
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,975
marking its first step
toward becoming a developed country.

44
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,061
This year, Korea's per capita income

45
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:33,606
is expected to finally exceed
10,000 US dollars.

46
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,734
An improvement in quality of life
must come

47
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,654
with changes in awareness,
behavior, and systems.

48
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,074
LEE YEONG-SIN
FORMER EMPLOYEE, SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE

49
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:49,455
My husband and I bought our home
fairly early in our marriage.

50
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,249
I wanted to earn some money

51
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,627
to at least cover
the interest on our loan.

52
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,171
JOB LISTINGS
TECHNICAL/PRODUCTION WORKER WANTED

53
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,172
Back in the '90s,

54
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,843
the Flea Market Find All paper
had the most job listings.

55
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,596
And there was an ad that caught my eye.

56
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,195
DECEMBER 1, 1989
SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE OPENS

57
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,447
SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE

58
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,990
The Sampoong Department Store.

59
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,617
It was located in Gangnam,

60
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,120
so I guess it seemed nicer.

61
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,874
That's why I decided to apply there.

62
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,965
It was really fancy and glamorous.

63
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,179
It was like a castle. A huge castle.

64
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,140
Welcome!

65
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,643
The uniforms were very classy too.
They were really pretty.

66
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,398
The inside of the building

67
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,526
was really bright and spacious.

68
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,615
No other department store at the time
could match its value.

69
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,825
LEE SEON-MIN
FORMER EMPLOYEE, SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE

70
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,206
At that time,
the Sampoong Department Store

71
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:18,294
aspired to be the most upscale
and best department store in the country.

72
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,004
Everything there was expensive.

73
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,047
IM CHAE-GU
FORMER EMPLOYEE

74
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,591
BAEK GI-JONG, FORMER DETECTIVE
SEOCHO POLICE STATION

75
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,928
The actress Choi Myung-gil was featured
in commercials for the department store.

76
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:33,101
It was clearly a place for the wealthy,
those with no financial constraints.

77
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,728
Your deep satisfaction is our priority.

78
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,065
The food section
was on the first basement level.

79
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,817
SAMPOONG USHERS IN A NEW ERA OF SHOPPING

80
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,777
I sold maple syrup there…

81
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,862
LEE YEONG-SIN, FOOD SECTION
B1, BUILDING A

82
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,532
…which was imported from Canada.

83
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,075
It was a part-time job.

84
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,996
I worked in the home goods section
on the first basement level,

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,915
specializing in crystal glassware.

86
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,711
YOO JI-HWAN, HOME GOODS SECTION
B1, BUILDING A

87
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:05,049
They were quite pricey,
probably over 100,000 won for a full set.

88
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,759
They're probably even pricier now.

89
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,637
In the basement food hall,

90
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,682
there was a storage area for belongings.

91
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,642
LEE SEON-MIN, STORAGE AREA
B1, BUILDING A

92
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,103
It was where we stored
customers' shopping bags from upstairs.

93
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:22,358
I was assigned to return the items later,
when they brought their ticket.

94
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,156

LEE YEONG-SIN
FOOD SECTION

98
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,498
And one day…

99
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,628
I heard there was something wrong
with the building.

100
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,590
So the accident happened on the 29th.

101
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,634
June 29th, 1995.

102
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,053
It was June 29th, 1995.

103
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,098
From what I remember, it was 5:57 p.m.

104
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,644
What happened on June 29th, 1995?

105
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,606
The building we worked in…

106
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,732
Where I worked…

107
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,442
The Sampoong Department Store

108
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,569
collapsed.

109
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:24,629
SAMPOONG, ON THAT DAY

110
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,135
Being late June,
the weather was already hot.

111
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,345
It was in the early summer.

112
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,138
YOO JI-HWAN
WORKED IN HOME GOODS SECTION, B1

113
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,182
It was a nice sunny day.

114
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,021
I remember being in a good mood
on my way to work.

115
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,315
LEE YEONG-SIN
WORKED IN FOOD SECTION, B1

116
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,570
After I got to work,
I had a cup of coffee with my colleagues.

117
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
I changed into my uniform

118
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,702
and went downstairs

119
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,958
to the first basement level,
where I organized the display stands.

120
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,088
At that point,
how long had you been working there?

121
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,174
I think it was about six or seven months.

122
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,762
But at first,

123
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,350
the building didn't show
any signs of shaking or anything.

124
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,522
They just said the air conditioning
was broken and was being fixed.

125
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:29,902
But then there was talk
that the fifth floor had sunk a bit.

126
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,991
10:00 A.M.
CRACKS ON THE 5TH FLOOR

127
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,576
It was really hot.

128
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,160
LEE SEON-MIN
WORKED IN STORAGE AREA, B1

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,328
Really hot and humid.

130
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,417
I heard the air conditioning was broken.

131
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:52,675
11:30 A.M.
CRACKS ON THE ROOFTOP

132
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,553
So we didn't have many customers that day.

133
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,763
Some people came in,

134
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,144
but most left,
saying, "Why is it so hot in here?"

135
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,650
Then I heard the escalator
up to the food court

136
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,027
was misaligned somehow.

137
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,237
1:00 P.M.
CRACKS NEAR THE ESCALATORS

138
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,780
They were under construction,

139
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,241
and we had to keep quiet
to avoid hurting business.

140
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,040
You see,

141
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,170
we're talking about
an iconic, high-end department store.

142
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,965
Naturally, I assumed
things would go back to normal.

143
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,342
It's just common sense.

144
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,636
If something was really wrong,

145
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,263
they would've evacuated us
or taken some kind of action,

146
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,683
but we didn't hear anything about it.

147
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,854
So the employees didn't think much of it.

148
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,981
We were just thinking,

149
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,151
"Let's get home quickly."

150
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:06,749
5:57 P.M., JUNE 29, 1995
B1, BUILDING A

151
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,293
We suddenly heard a thud…

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,795
YOO JI-HWAN
HOME GOODS SECTION, B1

153
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,922
…and right after that,

154
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,257
the building started shaking.

155
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,678
At first, there was one big thud,

156
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,514
but after a pause,
it just kept going, thud after thud.

157
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,106
Like they say in books,

158
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,566
"the ground quaked violently."

159
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,908
It was like a sudden gust of wind.

160
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,120
There was a huge gust of wind blowing

161
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,038
from behind.

162
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,707
LEE SEON-MIN, STORAGE AREA
B1, BUILDING A

163
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,293
I instinctively crouched,
thinking, "What's going on?"

164
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,715
Next thing I knew, there was an explosion.

165
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,219
I heard this massive explosion.

166
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,850
A mom said
she lost hold of her child's hand,

167
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,476
and the child was sent flying.

168
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,733
I was working at my desk in the office…

169
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,152
5:57 P.M., JUNE 29, 1995
3RD FLOOR, BUILDING B

170
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,653
…and then I heard this loud thud.

171
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,612
IM CHAE-GU
DATA CENTER

172
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,116
I thought, "What was that?"
Then I turned around and came out.

173
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,368
IM CHAE-GU
WORKED IN DATA CENTER, BUILDING B

174
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,995
I saw the skywalk

175
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,832
between Building A and Building B collapse
with my own eyes.

176
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,711
Just like a bombing or flooding scene

177
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,089
from The Bridge on the River Kwai
or Die Hard,

178
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,633
it collapsed in an instant.

179
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,344
I think I yelled, "Get down!"

180
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,888
"Run!"

181
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,308
I ran the moment I heard it.

182
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,311
I turned and started running immediately,

183
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,982
but after just a step or two,
I fell straight to the ground.

184
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,485
And then…

185
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,737
Everything went black.

186
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,575
How many seconds do you think it all took?

187
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,077
Less than five seconds.

188
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,376
The collapse
of the Sampoong Department Store

189
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,463
has left the entire nation speechless

190
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,090
as they witness
the unbelievable scene live.

191
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,638
Once known for its luxury and grandeur
in Seocho-dong, Seoul,

192
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,224
the Sampoong Department Store
collapsed in two seconds.

193
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:33,938
At present, no one is able to estimate
how many people were inside.

194
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:41,028
6:03 P.M., JUNE 29, 1995
IN FRONT OF THE SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE

195
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,865
As soon as they heard the news,

196
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,368
all the reporters there
got into their news vans…

197
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,370
KIM GU-CHEOL
FORMER PHOTOJOURNALIST, MUNHWA ILBO

198
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,039
…and headed to the scene
at the Sampoong Department Store.

199
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,502
Everyone was in such a rush
that they turned on the sirens

200
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,213
and kept crossing over the center line
the whole way.

201
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,886
KIM NAM-MOK, FORMER DETECTIVE
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

202
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,972
At 55 minutes past,
I was the first one out the door

203
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,557
as soon as I heard the radio message.

204
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,641
Suddenly…

205
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,560
OH YEONG-SANG
FORMER OWNER, SAMPOONG GAS STATION

206
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,855
…all the windows shattered,
like a hammer hit them all at once.

207
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,237
I thought,
"Why are they breaking all the windows?"

208
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,155
"That's strange."

209
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,199
And as those windows broke,

210
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,161
the building collapsed without warning.

211
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,621
It happened in a flash.

212
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,126
It was just like the building demolitions
you see on TV.

213
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,589
It collapsed with a boom.

214
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,967
There was this massive cloud of dust.

215
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,554
A cloud of dust rose up.

216
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,893
-Look!
-Where are the victims?

217
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,020
-What?
-There's a person there.

218
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,861
I was stunned. I was like, "What is this?"

219
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,157
As a photojournalist, I had no idea
where to begin reporting this.

220
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,784
KIM CHANG-JONG
FORMER PHOTOJOURNALIST, THE CHOSUN ILBO

221
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,245
I had my camera and bag with me,
so I started running.

222
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,165
Even as I started running,

223
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,459
I wasn't sure what I should be doing.

224
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,214
I couldn't tell if what I was witnessing
with my own eyes was real or a dream.

225
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,431
People were running in every direction,
screaming for help.

226
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,854
Some were in uniform,
their long hair covered in dust.

227
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,899
Not knowing where to go,
they just ran around,

228
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,359
shouting for help.

229
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,071
It was almost like a horror movie.

230
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,864
It was truly terrifying.

231
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,534
People lying everywhere.

232
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,996
I even saw people
who had been thrown outside

233
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,375
from the first or second floor
as the building collapsed.

234
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,181
PARK TAE-SEON, FORMER RESCUE TEAM
INCHEON FIRE STATION

235
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,600
When we first arrived at the scene,
we scanned the area.

236
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,065
To carry out the operation,

237
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,069
we had to figure out
where to deploy the gear and personnel.

238
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,029
So we looked around,

239
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,492
and that's when we realized
just how massive the accident was.

240
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,418
All of Building A was gone.
Completely gone.

241
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,671
The whole thing collapsed.

242
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,131
Only Building B was left.

243
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,383
JUNG GAK-HYEON, FORMER RESCUE TEAM
SEOCHO FIRE STATION

244
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:55,097
I am Professor Chung Lan,
an endowed chair at Dankook University…

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,933
CHUNG LAN, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR
SAMPOONG COLLAPSE ANALYSIS TASK FORCE

246
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,853
…and in 1995, I helped investigate
the Sampoong Department Store collapse.

247
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,441
How could something like this happen?

248
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,318
It was unprecedented.

249
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,823
Normally, a collapse leaves
some structural remains behind,

250
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,575
but here,

251
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,955
the entire building
sank completely into the ground.

252
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,332
That's why

253
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,379
I just couldn't understand
what had happened.

254
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,217
All that remained
were the core walls on either side.

255
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,803
And those core walls stood

256
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:40,059
as if they'd been cut away with a knife

257
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,227
from the rest of the building.

258
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,483
The Sampoong Department Store was regarded

259
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,985
as the most upscale in all of Seoul.

260
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,404
Built on 71,000 square feet of land,

261
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,990
the five-story concrete department store,

262
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,284
totaling 391,000 square feet
of floor space,

263
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,329
has now collapsed to the ground.

264
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,510
My cousin called me.

265
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,555
He said the place where Yeong-ja worked
had collapsed,

266
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,476
and I said, "What are you talking about?
Why would it collapse?"

267
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,894
JUNG GUN-JA
SISTER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM

268
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,521
He said, "Turn on the TV now."

269
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,775
My husband came home on his motorcycle

270
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,692
and said,

271
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,779
"What are you doing here?
Sampoong just collapsed."

272
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,156
"Sampoong collapsed,
and our child is buried in the rubble."

273
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,866
JIN OK-JA
MOTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM

274
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,827
I got in a cab right away
and headed to Sampoong.

275
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,328
When I got there,

276
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,666
everything had sunk underground
and was gone.

277
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,794
There was hardly anything visible
above the surface.

278
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
NA YEON-SU
FATHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM NA EUN-YEONG

279
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,386
We went there and saw that the building
had completely caved in.

280
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,764
We had no words.

281
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,224
We were lost for words.

282
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,726
KIM MAENG-SUN
MOTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM, NA EUN-YEONG

283
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,769
All we could do was cry.

284
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,690
It could collapse again, so step aside!

285
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,775
Ma'am, it's already too crowded in there.

286
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,152
-Are they dead?
-Sorry?

287
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,987
-Oh no.
-Ma'am, it's too crowded.

288
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,157
Come on, sir.

289
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,701
Come on, now.

290
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,752
She's 31 years old.

291
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,755
She's not wearing a badge.
She's a store manager.

292
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,593
She's a store manager,
but she's not on this list.

293
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,263
-She's not on it?
-No, she's not on the list.

294
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,849
I mean,

295
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,350
it was just…

296
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,770
People were tangled up,
and the emergency services rushed in.

297
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,399
Everyone was desperate
to find their own family,

298
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,401
and I was doing the same.

299
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,361
It was chaotic, really.

300
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,325
It was eating me up from the inside.

301
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,327
I was losing it.

302
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,095
I AM ALIVE

303
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,309
30 MINUTES AFTER THE COLLAPSE
BASEMENT

304
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,005
What did you see at that time?

305
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,257
Darkness.

306
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,342
It was just pitch dark in there.

307
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,551
It was pitch black.

308
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,471
It was just like an underground cave.

309
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:10,352
It was so dark that opening my eyes
felt like having them closed.

310
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:22,281
LEE YEONG-SIN, LEE SEON-MIN, YOO JI-HWAN

311
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,453
It was shaped somewhat like a dome.

312
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,540
Even now, that's all I remember.
It was dome-shaped.

313
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,333
All the ends were sealed.

314
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,253
I couldn't hear anything at the time.

315
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:47,639
You know those display stands they have
at department stores for special events?

316
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:53,061
I was lying on my side,
my head inside one of those stands.

317
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,363
It smelled like a construction site…

318
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,286
and I think I also smelled
something burning at first.

319
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,996
I smelled blood.

320
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,960
I had never smelled
such an intense smell of blood before.

321
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,630
And I heard these horrifying screams.

322
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,926
I was crying, begging for help.

323
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,057
I thought, "Is this how I die?"

324
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:35,270
As fear consumed me,
my strength began to fade.

325
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,362
I was too scared to fully realize
that I was injured and in pain.

326
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,282
I had open wounds deep enough
that you could see inside.

327
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,578
I had no idea what was happening outside,

328
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,206
so initially,
I thought a war had broken out.

329
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,419
It was total chaos.
It was just like a war zone.

330
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,716
Approximately 1,000 troops
from nearby military units,

331
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,219
including the army, navy, and air force,

332
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,554
are assisting with onsite rescue efforts.

333
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,682
Level three emergency.

334
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,686
All vehicles from 17 fire stations
were mobilized.

335
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,523
In terms of manpower,

336
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,151
several thousand firefighters
were likely deployed.

337
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,153
In terms of fire engines as well,

338
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,157
there were likely hundreds deployed.

339
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:35,831
STRUGGLING FOR LIFE

340
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,255
-I think someone's…
-Is someone in there?

341
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,464
-No, there isn't.
-No?

342
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,050
We're here to rescue you!

343
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,679
Don't lose hope.

344
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,473
Don't lose hope,
and if you can hear my voice,

345
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,309
you must bang on the wall
so we can rescue you!

346
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,394
My helmet.

347
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,608
Is anyone alive in there?

348
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
Anyone?

349
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,662
We used our voices.

350
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,914
GYEONG GWANG-SUK, FORMER RESCUE TEAM
DOBONG FIRE STATION

351
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,624
"Can anyone hear me in there?"

352
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,836
"If you can hear me,

353
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,465
grab whatever you can find

354
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,467
and bang it against something."

355
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,181
I didn't hear any sound.

356
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,933
I yelled for help…

357
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,477
YOO JI-HWAN
SAMPOONG COLLAPSE SURVIVOR

358
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,188
…but there was no response,
so I tried knocking as well.

359
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,523
I tried several times,

360
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,569
but no sound got through there.

361
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,493
I thought,
"Why is no one coming for me yet?"

362
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,582
Rescue efforts
are currently progressing slowly.

363
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,918
All that remains
between the exterior walls

364
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,921
is the debris of the department store,
bent like pulled candy.

365
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,718
Survivors are trapped
beneath layers of structural debris.

366
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,723
Digging through such debris isn't easy.

367
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
In order to find the survivors,

368
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,147
we just started digging
whenever we saw any small, confined space,

369
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,191
right from the first day.

370
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,610
-Pull!
-Lift them!

371
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,238
-Hey, wait.
-Go down.

372
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,116
Back then, we dug with our hands
without rescue equipment, the rescuers.

373
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,952
CHOI YEONG-SEOP
CIVILIAN RESCUE TEAM

374
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,997
We have no other choice
at a collapsed building site.

375
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,794
We couldn't bring in any equipment,

376
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,296
as there were survivors inside.

377
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,384
We couldn't

378
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,304
because using heavy equipment
on the collapsed debris

379
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,349
could have crushed the survivors to death.

380
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,820
There wasn't much space,
no matter how far we dug.

381
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,703
By removing structural debris
like plywood,

382
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,705
we could create a little room to work.

383
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,000
It was like a tiny cave,

384
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:31,548
with people pinned underneath displays
or H-beams,

385
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,134
crushed to death.

386
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:49,107
Then I heard loud noises,
like the sound of debris being cleared.

387
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,234
There were loud bangs.

388
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,282
They kept talking to me from the outside,

389
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,952
telling me to hold on
because the rescue team had arrived.

390
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,832
Given the circumstances,
they had to make a hole in the stand.

391
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,003
To be honest,

392
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,839
drills are frightening.

393
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,468
They were drilling a hole
directly above my head.

394
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,805
Actually, if I'd tilted my head
even slightly in the wrong direction,

395
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,768
that drill could have gone
right through it, so I was really scared.

396
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,479
-Knife!
-Hey, we need a knife!

397
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,356
-Bring a big knife!
-A big knife!

398
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,315
Anyone got a knife?

399
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,025
We need a large knife!

400
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,234
Come on, give it a pull!

401
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,903
-This?
-She's out!

402
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,071
Stay still.

403
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,073
One, two, three, up!

404
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,952
I think they really struggled
to drill that hole,

405
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,831
set up a supporting beam,

406
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,335
and pull us out through it.

407
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,023
I had been a carpenter for 18 years.

408
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,277
I've built maybe a few hundred buildings.

409
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,323
I had the news on,
even while I was eating.

410
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,495
In a disapproving tone,
the news anchor said,

411
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,874
"They say they can't continue the rescue
because there's no saw."

412
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,919
I thought,
"Wait, I have at least a dozen in my car."

413
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:33,837
"Hang on."

414
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:39,509
"I could save a precious life
by bringing those down there."

415
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,597
So I got dressed again
and made my way to the scene.

416
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,688
"We urgently need rebar workers."

417
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,399
They kept showing that caption
at the bottom of the screen.

418
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,610
YOOK GWANG-NAM, REBAR CUTTER OPERATOR
CIVILIAN RESCUE TEAM

419
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,946
And I'm a seasoned expert
when it comes to cutting rebar.

420
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,824
So I thought, "They need me down there."

421
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,200
"I have to go."

422
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,080
I went over the speed limit
for the first time in my life.

423
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,299
Citizens watching
the coverage on television

424
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,510
rushed to the scene
with equipment like rebar cutters.

425
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,348
No one asked them to do this,

426
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,435
and the scene is full of danger.

427
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:35,023
But many civilian volunteers are here,

428
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:40,028
risking their lives to actively assist

429
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,407
in the rescue efforts of their own accord.

430
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:48,119
Civilians with technical expertise,
like welders,

431
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,749
are assisting with the rescue efforts.

432
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,588
Did the rescue go smoothly?

433
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:05,553
As far as I remember,
the rescue efforts were inefficient.

434
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,097
Even after many days,

435
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,892
the removal work
still hadn't been carried out.

436
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,685
I hate to say this,

437
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,480
but civil servants
weren't prepared at all for this,

438
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,941
so it's no surprise
they were disorganized.

439
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,692
There was no command center either.

440
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,946
They were like headless chickens.

441
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,366
Looking back, it was a complete mess.

442
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,578
So many people arrived
before the situation could be assessed…

443
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,959
and everyone ended up acting on their own.

444
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,673
There was no clear guideline
on who was doing what.

445
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,884
Move!

446
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,802
Move!

447
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,179
Move out of the way!

448
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,739
Another thing
that was most unfortunate was…

449
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:12,370
There were several instances
where the rescue efforts were paused.

450
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,163
All kinds of people showed up.

451
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:21,254
THE DISRUPTORS

452
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,926
A shaman came
and even pinpointed a specific location.

453
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,149
Y or H.

454
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,483
Our last name is Yeom.

455
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,485
Y or H. Last name Yeom?

456
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,987
M, P, or H.

457
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,989
Park. Last name Park.

458
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,657
Either Park or Moon.

459
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742
M, P, or H.

460
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,412
This talisman will give you
good energy today.

461
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,205
-Park.
-M or P.

462
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,707
Anyone with the last name Park?

463
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,339
The Sampoong collapse site,
meant for scientific rescue efforts,

464
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,342
has drawn a surge of fortune tellers
from across the country.

465
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,763
In desperation, people are listening
to whatever they have to say.

466
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,934
If areas with possible survivors
are pinpointed accurately,

467
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,186
rescue efforts can proceed quickly.

468
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,773
Some people even flew in from abroad.

469
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,901
A young man named Oren
asked to halt the excavator work

470
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,945
and shared the details of his vision.

471
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:31,783
What's certain right now
is that there are people down there.

472
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,203
But he hasn't had enough time
to sense whether they're dead or alive,

473
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,705
so he can't be certain about it.

474
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,499
One time,

475
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,627
they withdrew all personnel,

476
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,713
including volunteer rescuers, at 3:00 p.m.

477
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,590
and blocked anyone from entering.

478
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,759
I asked why,

479
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,970
and they told me
the president was on his way.

480
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,347
Stay on the sidewalk, everyone!

481
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,739
In a moment when every second matters,

482
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,411
they cleared out all the volunteers
just because the president was coming.

483
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,544
I think that took
over three or four hours.

484
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:27,839
He went on top of the remains
that were flattened like a layered cake,

485
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,716
snapped his photos, and just left.

486
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,927
Why even bother coming?

487
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,015
I mean, it's just…

488
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,185
A lot of politicians visited the site,

489
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,190
so many that I actually lost count.

490
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,608
Please make way.

491
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,819
Coming through.

492
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,073
-Anything you'd like to say?
-Car.

493
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,616
We have to rescue them quickly.

494
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,201
They need to be rescued quickly.

495
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,286
Wait, there's a car.

496
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,125
Move that camera!

497
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,877
Out of the way!

498
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,963
-Keep your distance.
-Move!

499
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,427
Each time they did that,

500
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,596
the rescue operations were delayed.

501
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,475
They were just wasting our time, you know?

502
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,643
They weren't there to help.

503
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,978
We saw too many people

504
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,023
who looked like
they were getting in the way.

505
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,901
It was such a sorry sight.

506
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,751
And then…

507
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,881
Beneath the layer of dust
and the pile of concrete on the ground…

508
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,925
THE SCENE
OF THE SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE ACCIDENT

509
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,885
…we saw a flashing light.

510
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:04,685
THE INFERNO

511
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,395
"This is really bad."

512
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,523
"There are still people trapped inside."

513
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,691
"What do we do about them?"

514
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,529
There's a fire at the scene,
which hasn't happened before.

515
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,447
Cameras, could you please
pan toward the scene?

516
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,449
7 HOURS AFTER THE COLLAPSE
FIRE IN THE BASEMENT

517
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,953
We're now starting to see
blackish-red flames.

518
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,621
-Do you see it on the screen?
-Yes.

519
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,374
The building is ablaze.
This is truly devastating.

520
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,291
Indeed.

521
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,211
It was truly like hell.

522
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,964
It was no place for anyone to live.

523
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,259
It was so heartbreaking.

524
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,642
If anyone was alive inside,

525
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:49,313
they were now about to be burned alive
with no chance of escape.

526
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,612
Even the final glimmer of hope
seems to be fading.

527
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,781
What a heartbreaking sight this is.

528
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,309
My dear sister, Yeong-ja…

529
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:34,192
bought this for me with her paycheck
from working at the department store.

530
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,907
As for this one,

531
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,868
I'd never seen it in my life back then.

532
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,079
I asked her, "What does this do?"

533
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,582
She said,

534
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,920
"Gun-ja, people drink coffee
in other countries."

535
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,258
She gave me this as a gift.

536
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,347
THE LATE JUNG YEONG-JA

537
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,725
My younger sister's name is Jung Yeong-ja.

538
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,354
She was 24 years old at the time.

539
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,068
She worked
in the imported kitchenware section.

540
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,989
You know the Sampoong Apartments?

541
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,869
I waited under the eaves of the building
until she came out.

542
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,955
I didn't go home once.

543
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,919
The first day was understandable,

544
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,964
but then another day passed,
followed by two,

545
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,425
then three, and eventually about a week.

546
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,764
I thought they weren't getting anywhere.

547
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,475
I thought she must be
somewhere deep below.

548
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,936
Then they finally got to digging.

549
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,607
They spent a whole week digging.

550
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,950
The hole was now big enough
for a person to go in.

551
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,161
My older brother said,

552
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,331
"I'll go. I'll bring her out."

553
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,628
"She's probably exhausted right now."

554
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,089
So he went in, but he wouldn't come out.

555
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,263
Then my husband said,
"All right, let me go in there."

556
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,061
So my husband went in,
but he wouldn't come out either.

557
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,777
Everyone went in, but no one came out.
I thought, "Why aren't they back?"

558
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,240
AFTER THE COLLAPSE
FOOD SECTION, 1ST BASEMENT LEVEL

559
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,702
No one was there,
but the watermelons were intact.

560
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,378
There were over a hundred watermelons,
untouched by the accident.

561
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,506
They didn't come out
because they were down on the ground,

562
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,717
holding each other as they cried.

563
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,846
They figured if the watermelons were fine,
she must be alive somewhere,

564
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,265
waiting to be rescued.

565
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,314
I was so certain
that my sister was still alive.

566
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,657
3 DAYS SINCE SAMPOONG COLLAPSE

567
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,285
Unfortunately, according to the rescuers,

568
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,955
it is highly unlikely for there
to be any additional survivors.

569
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,250
At least 100 people are estimated
to be buried under Building A.

570
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,460
1ST BASEMENT LEVEL FLOOR PLAN

571
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,797
Both official and civilian rescuers
agree that it's highly unlikely

572
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,591
anyone is still alive under Building A.

573
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,055
We kept going, but most of the people
we found were already dead.

574
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,183
It turned into a recovery operation
for bodies.

575
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,018
Turn the head.

576
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,686
Don't drop them.

577
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,438
Cover the body.

578
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,650
Hey, move.

579
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,028
-Are they alive?
-This way.

580
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,154
No, they're not.

581
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,572
Four people at a time.

582
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,669
Honestly, we didn't find any bodies
that were undamaged.

583
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,296
They were all crushed
in one way or another.

584
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,258
There would be an arm that was severed.

585
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,720
Then we would find a leg,
followed by the head located elsewhere.

586
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,808
A single person's remains
could be spread across several places.

587
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,813
KIM MUN-SU
BROTHER OF SAMPOONG VICTIM KIM HAK-SU

588
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,149
The Sampoong Department Store collapse…

589
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,362
Structurally, a rescue was impossible.

590
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,076
As you may know,
many of the bodies were never found.

591
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,331
REPRESENTATIVE OF VICTIMS' FAMILIES

592
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,210
We formed a 20-member task force
from the victims' families.

593
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,339
We decided to check the scene ourselves,

594
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,009
so 20 of us went.

595
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,346
I was there looking at the scene,

596
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:20,561
and I thought, "No one could make it
like this even if they tried."

597
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,939
DESPAIR

598
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:31,155
It was stacked up like a layered cake.

599
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,911
Two basement floors and five above ground
were all just stacked up neatly.

600
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,622
It collapsed and piled up
like a layered cake.

601
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,875
The floors fell on top of each other
like a layered cake.

602
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,004
One layer was cement, the next was debris,

603
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,131
then cement again, then debris, and so on.

604
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,718
There was a pattern of layers
in the ruins.

605
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,681
-This spot is no good.
-Why not?

606
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,184
Everything here is crushed.

607
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,024
No one who was crushed

608
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,902
between those layers

609
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,363
could have survived.

610
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,203
1ST FLOOR CEILING

611
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,454
2ND FLOOR CEILING

612
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,539
3RD FLOOR CEILING

613
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,581
4TH FLOOR CEILING

614
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,625
5TH FLOOR CEILING

615
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,212
Between the fifth-floor slab,
the rooftop slab,

616
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,713
and the fourth-floor slab,

617
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,757
there was only

618
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,554
about 30 centimeters of space.

619
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,891
It was densely packed
with electrical wiring,

620
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,269
water pipes, and sewer pipes,

621
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:49,775
leaving only 30 centimeters of space
between the slabs.

622
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,861
That means…

623
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:59,952
It was impossible to imagine
anyone trapped in between surviving.

624
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,996
That's what it was.

625
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,081
Despair.

626
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,834
I took a block of tofu,

627
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,044
put it on a desk…

628
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,799
and slammed down on it like this.

629
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,136
It was crushed into pieces.

630
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:25,102
If the human body were
crushed by this heavy concrete directly,

631
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,729
it would be like the tofu.

632
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:31,233
At the site, we found clothes arranged
in the shape of a person.

633
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,570
There were clothes and even shoes.

634
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,867
The clothes were present,
but there was nothing inside.

635
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,413
However, the seams on the sides were torn.

636
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,052
You can see blood splatters
all over the walls around it.

637
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:08,187
THE VANISHED BODIES

638
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,816
Dozens of bodies were not recovered.

639
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,953
We were afraid people might drown
beneath the building,

640
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:30,751
so we brought in a pump
to drain the water.

641
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,634
But as we pumped the water out,

642
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,429
we began to see
bits of the victims' bodies.

643
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,309
Bone fragments or pieces of flesh
were in the mix.

644
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,812
So we got baskets

645
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:54,358
and placed them
where the water was coming out

646
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:01,365
to collect the bits
of the bodies of the deceased

647
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,370
and request DNA tests for them.

648
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,080
The bodies were gone.

649
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,668
They were crushed flat,
and the bits came out with the water.

650
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,669
So

651
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,423
I held a briefing as the representative

652
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,384
and stated that we needed
to bring in the equipment.

653
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,598
After some dispute, the decision was made
to quickly recover the bodies.

654
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,475
4 DAYS SINCE COLLAPSE
HEAVY MACHINERY DEPLOYED

655
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,227
Heavy machinery, such as excavators,

656
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,105
was at last placed atop the debris
of the collapsed building.

657
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:55,586
I wasn't sure if it was the machinery,
but I heard something.

658
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,884
I thought, "They're here,"
assuming they were coming to save me.

659
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,597
So I banged on the wall,
but there was no response.

660
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,394
The ceiling above my legs collapsed again.

661
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,152
Was there a secondary collapse?

662
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,487
Yes.

663
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,494
That's when I began thinking,
"No, what if I lose my legs?"

664
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,957
The wall was right in my face,

665
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,751
close enough to touch.

666
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,963
It kept closing in, coming down on me.

667
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,228
The scary part was knowing it was sinking.

668
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,651
At that moment,
my thoughts were mostly on my mom.

669
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,530
I had hardly ever told her
that I loved her.

670
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:07,866
But

671
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,579
I felt so bad for her,
as no parent should see their child go.

672
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,765
So what could have caused
such a catastrophic collapse?

673
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,602
Could my suspicions have been right?

674
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,940
The cracks on the rooftop…

675
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,276
Was that it?

676
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:47,114
MAN-MADE DISASTER

677
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,826
Then someone filed a report.

678
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,453
KIM HONG-SU, FORMER DETECTIVE

679
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,999
Apparently, the department store requested
several changes to the building's plans.

680
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,584
FOOD COURT, 5TH FLOOR
WATER LEAK, TILTED

681
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,585
REBAR DEFICIENCY

682
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,919
I said, "Send out detectives

683
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,047
to bring in the architects
and the construction company right now."

684
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,968
There is no way
civil servants weren't involved in this.

685
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:12,931
They colluded with relevant officials
from the Seocho-gu Office,

686
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,267
involving connections and bribery.

687
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,061
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
