00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,724
CHUSEOK, 1994

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,393
<i>Let's jump</i>

00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,146
<i>Ganggangsullae</i>

5
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>Let's boisterously mingle and jump</i>

00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,359
<i>Ganggangsullae</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,945
<i>Let the deep yard become shallow</i>

8
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,573
<i>Ganggangsullae</i>

9
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,324
<i>Let the shallow yard become deep...</i>

10
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,995
<i>"Let every day be like Hangawi," they say.
Today is that Hangawi.</i>

11
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:44,001
<i>But today, we saw the extremes
of just how cruel humans can be</i>

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>as we trembled with fear and rage.</i>

13
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,801
<i>"We gave up on being human."</i>

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,680
<i>During today's crime scene reenactment
at the gang's hideout,</i>

15
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>the perpetrators openly admitted
their inhumanity without hesitation.</i>

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,230
I'm not human.

17
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,149
I regret not killing
everyone who deserves to die.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,609
That I couldn't kill them all.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,111
Who didn't you get to kill?
Who did you want to kill?

20
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,656
People who have it all.

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,704
Kim Hyeon-yang said something to me
similar to what the press had reported.

22
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,789
He said he hated the rich

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,334
and the fact that they enjoyed
many privileges yet wanted even more.

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,880
That was when
college admissions corruption was rampant.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,133
People were paying their way into college.

26
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,804
Seoul National University was caught
in its first admissions scandal.

27
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,641
<i>These brokers disguised illicit admissions
under names like "surefire tutoring."</i>

28
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,353
<i>They enabled cheating and had others
take exams for higher grades.</i>

29
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,148
Scandals broke out at universities
across the country,

30
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,488
deepening despair and anger
among those already struggling.

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,909
"See? They get into those universities
because they have money."

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,621
"They can just hire a lawyer
and walk free."

33
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>Five students studying abroad,
part of the "Imported Oranges" crowd,</i>

34
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,380
<i>assaulted two people driving a Pride
with objects like bricks and flowerpots.</i>

35
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,801
<i>The assailants are part
of the so-called Imported Orange Tribe,</i>

36
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,971
<i>who return briefly from studying abroad</i>

37
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,224
<i>to bounce around the nightlife in Korea.</i>

38
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,643
The Orange Tribe. The Ya-ta Tribe.

39
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,939
Those were the days
when buzzwords like these were born.

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,361
In bars, Ballantine's 17-Year-Old
and 21-Year-Old Scotch

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,823
would cost nearly a million won back then.

42
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,449
They would drink bottles of those,

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,995
meaning they spent
millions of won in one night.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,791
They'd take their luxury cars,

45
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,961
drive down to the busy streets of Gangnam,

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,674
spot women walking by
who caught their eye,

47
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,301
and say, "Ya, ta,"
which means, "Hey, get in."

48
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,138
That's how they came to be known
as the "Ya-ta Tribe."

49
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,433
The media competed
to report on the phenomenon,

50
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,519
flooding the news with coverage.

51
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,814
"Let's cleanse this corrupt society."

52
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,233
That was the initial intent.

53
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,404
Honestly, it's hard for commoners like us
to earn even a few million won.

54
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,073
But it turns out tons of people
spend that much in a day.

55
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,951
Those who look down on the poor.

56
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,161
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

57
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,790
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

58
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,544
Hey! How am I guilty when Chun Doo-hwan
and Roh Tae-woo are innocent?

59
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,881
The laws in this country are fucked up!

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,767

THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

62
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,566
<i>Amid the cheer of the Chuseok holiday,</i>

63
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,362
<i>a wave of terror
swept through Hoesan Village.</i>

64
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,948
<i>Residents who gathered to see the scene,</i>

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,118
<i>a site of brutal killings
with an on-site incinerator,</i>

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,914
<i>trembled with disbelief
that such a thing could happen.</i>

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,918
They committed such evil, atrocious acts.
Are they even human?

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,295
Seriously,

69
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,589
something needs to be done about them.

70
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,802
They could've killed so many more
if they hadn't been stopped.

71
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,014
My heart is still racing.

72
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,266
<i>Residents who knew the suspects</i>

73
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,520
<i>still look stunned
by the sheer brutality of their crimes.</i>

74
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,149
Even with all the rumors
going around town,

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,484
I never imagined it would be this bad.

76
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,903
We never caught on.

77
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:26,701
And we had no idea
they were behind crimes like this.

78
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:34,709
KANG DAE-OK, NEIGHBOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY
AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,671
To be honest, it's all been forgotten now,

80
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,924
but the stigma lingered for a long time
among outsiders.

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,011
Even ten years ago,
people came to see where it happened.

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,556
They'd come in tour buses and say,
"That's the Chijon place."

83
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,268
Seeing that made us feel
really uneasy and uncomfortable.

84
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,978
So we'd just deny it.

85
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,067
Basically, we covered it up
by saying it was a different house.

86
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,277
That's the life we lived.

87
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,288
Over there.

88
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,039
See over there.

89
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,834
Up to there was a pepper field.

90
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,379
It's about 3,560 square feet.

91
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,882
Maybe 4,270 square feet<i>.</i>
It's worth around 1.8 million won.

92
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,968
It was right here.

93
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,388
Up to here, I think.

94
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,392
Right here was the basement.

95
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,353
From here to there.
The main building was here.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,784
While they were building,

97
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,870
I asked why they were digging,
and they said it was for a basement.

98
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,875
They said, "This would make
a good air-raid shelter too."

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,752
Once it was built,

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,005
they had it all locked up
and wouldn't open it for anyone.

101
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,508
They never showed it to anyone.

102
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:12,974
They said digging the basement alone
cost 30 million won.

103
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,978
Most of the perpetrators
were construction workers.

104
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,188
KO BYEONG-CHEON
LEAD DETECTIVE OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

105
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,899
Because they had done
a lot of construction work,

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,155
they built the entire house themselves
from scratch.

107
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,906
Where did you get the money
to build this house?

108
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,367
Manual labor. We did manual labor.

109
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,411
You built that house
with money from labor?

110
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,495
Yes.

111
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,873
Did you plan to move your mother in there?

112
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,583
No. We built it to do this.

113
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,959
To do what?

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,128
To kill them all.

115
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,218
We crossed the Paldang Bridge.
That's as far as I remember.

116
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,345
Suddenly, the car came to an abrupt stop.

117
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,181
Someone fired a gas gun,

118
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,685
and I thought,
"These people are kidnapping us."

119
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,523
I gave up and thought,
"They are definitely going to kill us."

120
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,402
They got him completely drunk,
then suffocated him with a plastic bag.

121
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,031
- Had the body gone stiff at this point?
- Yes.

122
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,872
Next was a husband and wife
who owned a small business.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,251
This was the couple's car.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,007
Their original demand was 100 million won,
but they ended up extorting 80 million.

125
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:33,429
After handing over the money,
the victim begged them to let his wife go.

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,640
He said, "We have young children."

127
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,142
"So my wife has to go home.
You can kill me."

128
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,144
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T HURT
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS

129
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,940
He dropped to his knees
and begged them. But...

130
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,280
That night, they were already making plans
to kill the couple.

131
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,043
DAY 8 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 16, 1994

132
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,504
It was the day after

133
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,923
he brought them the money.

134
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,551
They agreed to get the couple drunk,

135
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,555
put them to sleep, and then kill them.

136
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,474
They decided to take turns
giving them drinks.

137
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,853
"Let's just pretend to drink.
Don't actually drink any."

138
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,939
LEE HYO-JIN
LAST SURVIVOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,651
"They need to be drunk
so they won't know where they're going."

140
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,362
"So just tell them,
'You'll be home in the morning

141
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,241
when you wake up,'
as you give them the drinks."

142
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:41,455
So after getting the couple
completely drunk,

143
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:48,044
they had the survivor come down
to the basement to carry out the crime.

144
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,257
They put a shotgun in her hands
and told her, "Shoot them."

145
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,426
"Only then

146
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,219
can you become

147
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,554
a true member of the gang."

148
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,641
That's how they tried to convince her.

149
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:07,732
I think it was too heavy
for me to hold with both hands.

150
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,233
So...

151
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,904
Kim Hyeon-yang

152
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,159
helped me hold it.

153
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,414
He told me to place my finger
on the trigger, so I did.

154
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,249
But

155
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,087
I couldn't bring myself to pull it.

156
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,550
Then I...

157
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,901
They told me this right here
was a vital spot.

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,153
But I think when they screamed,

159
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,408
the barrel of the gun
must've slipped away from their head.

160
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,997
As I took a few steps back,

161
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,251
Kim Hyeon-yang
pressed up against me again,

162
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,881
lifted the gun again, held my hand,

163
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,219
put my finger back on the trigger...

164
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,433
pressed my finger...

165
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,520
and then...

166
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,204
<i>The police investigation</i>

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,374
<i>revealed that they murdered
the kidnapped victims in this basement,</i>

168
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,503
<i>dismembered their bodies, and burned them.</i>

169
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,507
<i>In the confinement cell,

170
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,176
<i>how they killed the couple

171
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,762
<i>with knives and hatchets.</i>

172
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,687
<i>In a desperate,
life-threatening situation,</i>

173
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,565
<i>the victim, a small business owner,
wrote a statement</i>

174
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,443
<i>revealing the brutal nature
of the suspects' interrogation.</i>

175
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,030
<i>Notes written by the perpetrators
were also found with it.</i>

176
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,700
<i>Even as he feared death drawing closer,</i>

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:28,038
<i>the victim begged the kidnappers
not to harm his wife and daughters.</i>

178
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>"I came from the streets too.
I know you're doing this to survive."</i>

179
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,210
<i>He begged them,
"I can always earn more money,</i>

180
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>so I won't try anything funny,"</i>

181
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,382
<i>but in the end, he was brutally murdered.</i>

182
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,010
I WON'T REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE

183
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,890
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T HURT
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS

184
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,350
<i>In the 1,070-square foot basement
of this house,</i>

185
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,021
<i>there is a body incinerator,
1 m by 1 m in size.</i>

186
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,482
<i>In the incinerator
were the remains of two people,</i>

187
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,818
<i>believed to be the kidnapped couple,
along with tools used in the crime,</i>

188
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,653
<i>such as hatchets, knives, and sickles.</i>

189
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,864
The skull was found down there,

190
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,075
and the pelvic bones were over here.

191
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,094
They were worried about the smoke
and the smell coming from the incinerator...

192
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,805
PARK RAE-YONG
REPORTER, COVERED THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

193
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,890
...so they deliberately grilled pork belly
in the yard

194
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,601
at the same time

195
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,688
to mask the smell.

196
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,193
The day before Chuseok, I came home
after cleaning up our family graves.

197
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,781
When I got home,
I could smell pork grilling.

198
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:49,036
I assumed they were grilling pork
to celebrate Chuseok after finishing work.

199
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,964
DAY 9 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 17, 1994

200
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,221
I think that was when I began
to get a grasp on reality.

201
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,933
"If I stay here any longer,
I'll die as well."

202
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,352
The incinerator was ready there,

203
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,607
so I figured it wouldn't be a problem
for them to burn me too.

204
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,985
I didn't sleep a wink,

205
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:27,741
thinking about how I could escape there
before Kim Gi-hwan was out of prison.

206
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,832
While Kim Hyeon-yang
was doing something under the car,

207
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,084
the dynamite exploded in the car,

208
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,671
leaving his hands and feet
already injured.

209
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,635
When Kim Hyeon-yang said in the morning
that he was going to the hospital,

210
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,139
he added that Chijon would be out soon.

211
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,102
Then he shot me a grin
I couldn't understand,

212
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,563
shook his head once,

213
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,983
and told me he had to go to the hospital,

214
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,153
so I'd have to stay there by myself.

215
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,909
I asked, "Can't I go to the hospital
with you and get some fresh air?"

216
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,411
He gave me a look...

217
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,458
handed me his wallet, told me to take it,

218
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,588
then grabbed a pile of cash
and asked me to count out 500,000 won.

219
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,761
He said, "Come with me."
I gave him the money and stepped out.

220
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,098
The guys in the yard were like,
"What's going on, bro?"

221
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,392
"Why are you taking her with you?"

222
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,227
"I know what I'm doing, man."

223
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:42,107
When he said, "Get in, Hyo-jin,"
I opened the door and got in the car.

224
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
I thought to myself,

225
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,656
"I won't die by Kim Gi-hwan's hand today."

226
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,994
"Someone outside needs to know I'm dead."

227
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,583
Because I know how they killed the couple
and burned their bodies.

228
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,879
"I won't die like that.
If I die, it'll be out in the street."

229
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,135
We arrived at the hospital,

230
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,973
and Kim Hyeon-yang and I
sat next to each other.

231
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,685
It occurred to me
that he might take me with him

232
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,898
when he entered the hospital room,
asking me to help him in.

233
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,944
But he was just sitting there
when he suddenly said,

234
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,238
"If you want to run away, run away."

235
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,949
"You want to escape, don't you?
You want to run away?"

236
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,077
It was as if he could read my mind.

237
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,420
He slowly walked to the hospital room,

238
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,799
opened the door,
and turned to look at me one last time.

239
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,010
He gave a quick nod,

240
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,305
flashed me a brief smile
with just the corners of his mouth,

241
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,599
then stepped inside.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,107
I thought to myself,
"This must be my fate."

243
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,944
"I'm getting out of here,
even if they're waiting for me outside."

244
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:14,324
"I'm getting out of this hospital.
If I'm going to die, I'll die outside."

245
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:21,414
As soon as he went inside,
I slowly got up and didn't even run.

246
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:25,126
If I screamed then,
I'd just draw attention to myself.

247
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,795
So I slowly got up,

248
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,964
went out the main exit,

249
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,218
and decided to head somewhere
with no one around.

250
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,305
There was an alley to the right,

251
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,809
so I ran as if I were in a 100-meter race,
staring straight ahead.

252
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,271
I reached the end of the alley,
and there was a road.

253
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,027
I got into the back seat
of any taxi that was stopped

254
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,156
and told the driver I'd been kidnapped,
that they'd killed the other victim,

255
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,533
and I had just managed to escape.

256
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,162
The taxi driver asked who they were,

257
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,248
saying he knew everyone in the area.

258
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,418
"I know everyone in Yeonggwang."

259
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,004
He kept asking,
"Who is it? Tell me, who is it?"

260
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,091
He said he could go help catch them.

261
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,678
Hearing how he underestimated them,
I thought, "No, this isn't right."

262
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,389
And the claim they made before was,

263
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,977
"Almost all the taxi and bus drivers
in this neighborhood

264
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,189
are members of our organization."

265
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,818
That's what they told her,
and recalling it,

266
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,863
she got out of the taxi midway,
at a place with an orchard.

267
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,076
There were farms with pigs and cows.

268
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,246
I was so desperate at that moment

269
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:47,625
that I thought, "Should I hide out
in a pig pen? Or a barn?"

270
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,169
I continued on,
my mind racing with thoughts,

271
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,173
constantly fearing they'd come find me.

272
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,510
Even after escaping,

273
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,305
I didn't feel completely free
from their grasp.

274
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,432
I thought if they searched for me
from town to town,

275
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,269
they could find me.

276
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,356
I opened the greenhouse
without hesitation.

277
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,567
All I could think was,

278
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,403
"The only good place to hide
is under the platform."

279
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,446
So I decided to crawl in

280
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,324
and keep an eye on the entrance.

281
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,704
That way, I could see
whoever opened the door.

282
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:34,130
I didn't even consider
going to the Yeonggwang Police Station.

283
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,965
Kim Hyeon-yang told me,

284
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,677
"If we ever decide to, we can easily raid

285
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,222
both Yeonggwang Police Station
and the nearby precinct."

286
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:48,102
"We can bring all the weapons
and anything else from there if we want."

287
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:52,191
Remembering that,
I thought, "I shouldn't go there."

288
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,944
I was really scared then too.

289
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:00,781
I kept my eyes closed,
but I was too terrified to keep them shut.

290
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,659
After a while, I fell asleep.

291
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,622
I woke up after a while
and noticed it was getting darker.

292
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,209
When I woke up again,
I realized it was pitch dark.

293
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,883
That's when I noticed
the light was on outside.

294
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,594
"Oh, there's a house here."

295
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,307
She came out again after sunset
and found the owner of the house.

296
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,811
She told them
she was being chased by some people

297
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,563
and asked them to call a rental car.

298
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,316
She drove the rental car to Daejeon,

299
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,443
got in a different car there,

300
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,154
and took a taxi to Seoul.

301
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,490
YEONGGWANG, JEOLLANAM-DO

302
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,159
EAST SEOUL TOLLGATE

303
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,622
SEOCHO-GU

304
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,629
THE EARLY MORNING AFTER THE ESCAPE
SEPTEMBER 18, 1994

305
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,516
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

306
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,559
Everyone thought she was on meth.

307
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,854
Her statement was so wild
that it sounded like fiction.

308
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,066
She was shaking like a leaf,

309
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,735
as if she had a cold.

310
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,113
OH HU-GEUN
DETECTIVE ON THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

311
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:26,325
She kept talking about chopping up bodies,
shooting people to death,

312
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,744
dismemberment, and burning the bodies.

313
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,997
She told us

314
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,791
that a murder case was mishandled
as a traffic accident.

315
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,337
That she was the victim who was with him.

316
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,673
We contacted Jangsu Police Station

317
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,718
to check if a traffic accident
like the one she described had occurred.

318
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,972
When they confirmed it,
I realized she'd been telling the truth.

319
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:53,519
With enough circumstantial evidence
to believe it might be true,

320
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,604
we agreed to go.

321
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,066
There were seven of us and five of them.

322
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,277
We didn't have enough people.

323
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,821
We needed at least two of us
for each of them.

324
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,741
We need two people per suspect.

325
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,200
So we talked to a few other colleagues.

326
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,411
But

327
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,414
none of them volunteered to help,

328
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,000
since it was two days before Chuseok.

329
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,671
Even our own squad had someone
trying to skip out because of Chuseok.

330
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,759
That's how shorthanded we were.
There was no one to help us.

331
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,887
So we put everything on the line
and went on our own.

332
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,349
We went there
thinking it would end one way or another.

333
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,519
Either we'd die or catch them all.

334
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,273
We took three cars, two in each.

335
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,110
We had two guns and 12 live rounds.

336
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,113
And back then, detectives kept
beacon lights in their cars.

337
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,367
We put them on the vehicles
and headed out.

338
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,044
I had Hyo-jin in my car.

339
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,047
She was too anxious to stay in her seat
and sat on the floor.

340
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,216
She was trembling.

341
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:09,011
Without Hyo-jin,
we couldn't identify them.

342
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,640
We relied on her help in several ways.

343
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,162
We left Seoul at 9:00 p.m.,
and when we arrived,

344
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,249
it was around 1:30 or 2:00 a.m.

345
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,628
It was pitch dark,
and the neighborhood was so quiet

346
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,924
that the sound of our voices
and the cars coming in

347
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,594
made all the neighborhood dogs
start barking.

348
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,017
DAY OF THE CHIJON FAMILY'S ARREST
SEPTEMBER 19, 1994

349
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,895
When we got there,

350
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:04,317
the informant got nervous
and lay flat in the backseat.

351
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,361
She said,
"It's that house. That's the one."

352
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,737
I said, "Got it."

353
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,408
"I'll move the car."
And I moved the car back there.

354
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,617
Over there, up ahead.

355
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:18,038
After parking the car up there,
we talked about how to go about it.

356
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,625
"Do we ambush them now
or wait until morning?"

357
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,127
In the end...

358
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,089
we decided to wait until morning.

359
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:33,722
With binoculars and a walkie-talkie,
I stood by on the farm road.

360
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,602
As the sun started to rise
around 6:00 a.m.,

361
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,230
one person came out of the house.

362
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,483
This one person came out.

363
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,987
He reversed the truck,
opened the door, and stepped out.

364
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,699
We saw his face.
It was Kang Dong-eun without a doubt.

365
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,825
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

366
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,747
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

367
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,751
I told the standby team down there
over the walkie-talkie,

368
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,296
"He's heading that way. Get him."

369
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,595
We were closing in,
fully prepared to ram into his car.

370
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,017
So our car crashed into the truck
with a bang.

371
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,729
Next to the road was a steep slope
about three or four meters high.

372
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,856
Kang ran down it
after getting out of the car.

373
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,650
So we chased after him.

374
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,652
Then we arrested him,

375
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,989
and he confessed on the spot
to everything they had done.

376
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,119
After we arrested Kang Dong-eun,

377
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,251
we couldn't come up with a plan
to arrest the others at that moment.

378
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,546
After a quick thought,
we realized we should lure them outside.

379
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,007
We took Kang Dong-eun
to a nearby precinct.

380
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,890
We explained the situation to them.

381
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,645
We told them we came from Seoul
to arrest the suspect.

382
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,021
After thinking it through,

383
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,149
we decided to lure them out
by saying there was a car accident.

384
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,363
We told the precinct employee
they'd only believe it

385
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,282
if the person on the line
used the local dialect.

386
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,951
We asked them to say
Kang had an accident and was injured.

387
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,746
He needs to go to the hospital,
so someone must come.

388
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,419
We were waiting in our car

389
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,797
when another car drove up right here.

390
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,009
Moon Sang-rok stepped out of the car.

391
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,474
We expected the car to drive in.

392
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,810
Only Moon got out and walked in slowly.

393
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,022
We needed the car to drive in,
but we grew impatient when it didn't.

394
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:52,193
So I chased after him and caught him,
since we couldn't let him escape.

395
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,821
While we were struggling to arrest him...

396
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,451
Seeing that,
Kim Hyeon-yang started to flee.

397
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,497
We had one car on standby

398
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,833
in case any of them tried to run.

399
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:12,422
Kim Hyeon-yang was on the run,
but when he realized he couldn't escape,

400
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,760
he tried to take his life
by driving the car into a wall.

401
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,513
Fortunately, he didn't die

402
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,976
and was arrested
by the detectives, unharmed.

403
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,982
Afterward, we restrained them with rope
and had them wait.

404
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,858
Then we went to their hideout.

405
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,737
On our way, we requested assistance
from Yeonggwang Police Station.

406
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:41,867
We went in, guns blazing,
to arrest the two people inside,

407
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,912
since they had their own guns.

408
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,330
We went in, firing blanks,

409
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,626
and one of them just put his hands up,
too startled to resist.

410
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,587
The other tried to flee
to the mountain behind the house

411
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,006
but was caught by the mobile unit.

412
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,132
KANG
LEE, HIS LOVER

413
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,634
KIM, MOON, KANG, BAEK

414
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,638
BESIDES LEADER KIM GI-HWAN
SIX CHIJON FAMILY MEMBERS ARRESTED

415
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:10,230
Kang Dong-eun's girlfriend
was working at a place Kang knew.

416
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,774
They said they were worried
after Hyo-jin disappeared

417
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,444
as people might become suspicious
of the woman's disappearance.

418
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,365
They concluded that they needed
a female member.

419
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,785
I think she had a debt of six million won,
which Kang Dong-eun paid off.

420
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,454
In return, he asked her
to cook for him and his friends,

421
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,707
and she agreed.

422
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,500
Even after coming to the hideout,

423
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,629
his girlfriend actually had no idea
if they were criminals or up to no good.

424
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,133
So she was charged with aiding a fugitive,

425
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,387
and I think she got out
in about ten or twenty days.

426
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,852
Okay. All done!

427
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,856
Show us your faces!

428
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,319
We found
dozens of different weapons there.

429
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,532
There were
more than ten sticks of dynamite,

430
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,034
a gun with a telescopic sight,

431
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:11,583
and a cane that could be disassembled
to reveal a blade.

432
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,337
In my 30 years as a detective,
I'd never seen anything like that.

433
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,632
It was truly unbelievable.

434
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,219
I couldn't believe
such a situation existed.

435
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,601
- Have them stand side by side.
- In a row.

436
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,063
I feel like I killed the wrong people,
not the ones I really wanted to.

437
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,858
Who didn't you get to kill?
Who did you want to kill?

438
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,360
People who have it all.

439
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:44,782
The rich who flaunt their wealth in Seoul.
They made us who we are.

440
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,784
If they keep this up,

441
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,244
people like us won't just stand by.

442
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,954
If you're done filming, move!

443
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:55,668
Seven young people
form a criminal organization

444
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:01,174
and commit serial murders
targeting the wealthy?

445
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,384
This was an unusual case,

446
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:10,015
not just in Korea
but in the global history of crime.

447
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:15,145
At the time,
even international outlets such as CNN

448
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,981
came to cover the case.

449
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:26,156
Living at rock bottom
and being treated coldly by society,

450
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:30,829
they said they committed these crimes
to take revenge.

451
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,792
The gap between the haves
and the have-nots is too large.

452
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,171
And the wealthy look down on the poor.

453
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,049
Honestly, the poor will be poor forever.

454
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,428
Kim Hyeon-yang said
he had worked and saved money.

455
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,057
But a fight broke out at a street bar,

456
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,812
and he ended up losing eight million won
in settlement.

457
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,275
He was saying

458
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,238
that the person,
despite already being rich,

459
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,325
took the money he'd worked so hard for.

460
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,620
That person took
the eight million won from him,

461
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,748
even though they didn't need it.

462
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,542
As he was telling me this, he said,

463
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,087
"The rich are greedier.
Those who have more are more selfish."

464
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:26,341
"So even if we can't take their money,

465
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:30,220
we want to kidnap and kill them."

466
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,389
"That's our wish."

467
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:38,228
After the crime scene reenactment
in Jangsu, Jeonbuk State,

468
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,316
they were transported to Seoul.

469
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,075
I guess I was lucky.

470
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:56,580
For the first time in history,
a prisoner transport vehicle set off

471
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,958
with both a reporter and suspects
on board.

472
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
I sat beside

473
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,423
Kim Hyeon-yang.

474
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,470
I told him I was a reporter
from the Kyunghyang Shinmun...

475
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,807
and had a few questions.

476
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,311
When I told him that,

477
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,774
the first thing he asked
was to see my wallet.

478
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,903
As I remember,
I didn't have much money on me.

479
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,783
I think I had about 70,000 won,
from what I remember.

480
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,534
Kim Hyeon-yang said,

481
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,704
"You don't have jack shit,"

482
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,414
and added,

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,126
"We were planning to kill
all you reporters too."

484
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:51,802
If I had happened to have a lot of money
in my wallet back then,

485
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,641
I might have been classified
as a target to be killed.

486
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,185
"Those rich assholes
who throw their money around."

487
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,146
"Let's take their money."

488
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,148
"And let's rack up a billion won."

489
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,361
"We'll do our best to make a billion won."

490
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,946
That was all they were thinking.

491
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,198
They had no other thoughts.

492
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,950
At Cheonggyecheon,

493
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:19,706
they bought the VIP list
of a high-end department store in Gangnam.

494
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,752
<i>A list of 1,300 department store VIPs
acquired by the Chijon Family</i>

495
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,170
<i>has been confirmed.</i>

496
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,464
<i>The list includes
almost the entire social elite,</i>

497
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,758
<i>including high-ranking public officials,</i>

498
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,512
<i>lawmakers, hospital directors,
and executives of major companies.</i>

499
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,181
<i>If the Chijon Family
hadn't been apprehended,</i>

500
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,268
<i>some individuals on this list
would have become their targets.</i>

501
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,771
Have you attempted a crime
against anyone on that VIP list?

502
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,148
We were planning to do so.

503
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,357
So you never tried?

504
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,695
We were planning to do it after Chuseok,
but we've been caught.

505
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,405
After going through the list,

506
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:59,995
they selected a customer
who spent seven million won

507
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,875
in one day as their first target.

508
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,335
How did you obtain
that list of department store customers?

509
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,839
Near Cheonggyecheon.
But I'm not sure which neighborhood.

510
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,841
Cheonggyecheon. So it was in Seoul.

511
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,426
Who introduced you to them?

512
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,847
We meet and complete the transaction
without knowing each other.

513
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,976
In short, how much did you pay the broker
for that list?

514
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,646
Including the other weapons,
it was about five million.

515
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,148
- What?
- Five million.

516
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,027
Where did you hear you could get
those things at Cheonggyecheon?

517
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,445
That's common knowledge.

518
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,863
Common knowledge, huh?

519
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,281
Among many department stores,

520
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,160
you chose Hyundai Department Store
in Apgujeong, right?

521
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,244
That's the wealthy neighborhood.

522
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,330
How many people were you planning to harm?

523
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,999
All 1,200 people on that list.

524
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,963
Honestly, it's hard for commoners like us
to earn even a few million won in a day.

525
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,675
But it turns out tons of people
spend that much in a day.

526
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,427
I only targeted those people.

527
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,974
I never harmed the weak.

528
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,103
Those who look down on the poor.

529
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,312
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

530
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:12,026
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

531
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,403
That's how I feel.

532
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,991
THE SITE OF THE FIRST VICTIM'S EXHUMATION

533
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,787
A HILL NEAR DUGYE STATION
(NOW GYERYONG STATION)

534
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,805
<i>The first victim of the Chijon Family,
murdered to practice killing,</i>

535
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,016
<i>has been identified.</i>

536
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:48,145
<i>Ms. Choi,
who was even poorer than her killers,</i>

537
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,188
<i>was a sweet country girl</i>

538
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,525
<i>striving hard for her dream.</i>

539
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:57,320
<i>In light of this,
the killers' claims of societal resentment</i>

540
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,198
<i>seem completely disingenuous.</i>

541
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,994
From the first to the fourth crime,

542
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,665
they were neither rich, wealthy,
nor part of the upper class.

543
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,170
They were just ordinary people,
barely getting by.

544
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,423
They waited by the roadside,

545
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:21,011
spotted a Grandeur, blocked it,
and kidnapped the passengers, right?

546
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,097
But, later,

547
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,685
it turned out
that the musician had purchased

548
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,938
the Grandeur as a used vehicle.

549
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,694
As for the small business owners,

550
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,448
they were kidnapped
after visiting their family graves

551
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,743
and held for ransom.

552
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,663
Do those people

553
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,875
belong to the wealthy class

554
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,253
they believe mistreated them?

555
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,882
I'm so sorry for what we did

556
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,718
to those people.

557
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,014
We went after Grandeur drivers,

558
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,892
only to find they were all good people
and small business owners.

559
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:14,022
People may face rejection,
anger, loss, and alienation,

560
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:19,737
but they don't turn to the kind of cruelty
the Chijon Family did.

561
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,825
Not everyone who lives an unhappy life
expresses their hatred in such a way.

562
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,371
One can offer
all the excuses and rhetoric,

563
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,207
but in the end, those men

564
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,629
still kidnapped, robbed,
and murdered for money.

565
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,965
<i>Kim Gi-hwan,
the boss of the Chijon Family,</i>

566
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,550
<i>was indicted for raping
a teenage girl in August</i>

567
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,762
<i>and is now imprisoned in Gwangju.</i>

568
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,640
<i>Upon hearing the news
of the Chijon Family's arrest,</i>

569
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,478
<i>he said his boys had done a splendid job,
leaving the officers dumbfounded.</i>

570
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,689
<i>He said his boys made him proud</i>

571
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,527
<i>and that he was leaving this world
30 or 40 years early with pride.</i>

572
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,409
Before that,
Kim Gi-hwan was charged with rape,

573
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,245
treated as a regular offender,
and held in gen pop.

574
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,330
LAW

575
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,375
He mentioned it as a correctional officer
took him outside.

576
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,712
He said he could just die 30 years early.

577
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,631
He was 27 or 28 years old at the time.

578
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,050
"I'd probably live to around 60 anyway."

579
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,679
"I don't mind leaving 30 years early.
It puts me at ease."

580
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,815
At first, Kim Gi-hwan flatly denied
conspiring to commit the crimes.

581
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,736
Later, as the investigation progressed,

582
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,072
he realized there was no way to avoid it.

583
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,744
So he admitted to the crimes,
said he was the leader,

584
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,038
that he planned everything,

585
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:56,167
and even claimed
the other members were innocent.

586
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,335
They said it over and over.

587
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,670
"We do whatever Chijon tells us to do."

588
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,133
"And that's why
we killed Song Bong-u as well."

589
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:10,056
"And as for what happened in Daejeon,
we were just following his orders."

590
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,270
There are differing opinions
on why Kim Gi-hwan ended up in prison.

591
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,733
Some say he ended up there
simply for committing rape.

592
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,528
Others believe
he intended to give the orders

593
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,322
but stay out of the crimes

594
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,410
so that if they were caught,
he'd face a lighter sentence.

595
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,748
He only raped and killed Ms. Choi
with his own hands at the beginning.

596
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,251
He didn't personally kill
any of the other victims.

597
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,213
So I believe
he deliberately went to prison

598
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,507
to avoid culpability.

599
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,134
It's possible with Kim Gi-hwan's brain.

600
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,135
It's a nice world we live in.

601
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,136
KIM GI-HWAN'S MOTHER

602
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,180
You can make a living driving a car.

603
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,017
I don't know
what would have made him do such a thing.

604
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,186
Had we known,
we wouldn't have let him do something

605
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,189
that led to his death.

606
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,984
He was a good student in school.
I don't know what happened.

607
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
Come on. Get in.

608
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,539
One last thing you want to say?

609
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,915
This world is fucking shit.

610
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,168
Hey, move.

611
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,555
<i>Six members of the Chijon Family
were sentenced to death,</i>

612
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,516
<i>as expected
and demanded by the prosecution.</i>

613
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,352
<i>The court stated
that the inhuman acts of these men,</i>

614
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,439
<i>who abandoned their humanity
in both motive and method,</i>

615
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,984
<i>warranted the harshest punishment.</i>

616
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,408
Hey! How am I guilty when Chun Doo-hwan
and Roh Tae-woo are innocent?

617
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,786
The laws in this country are fucked up!

618
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:11,177
"What right do you think you have
to pass judgment on us?"

619
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,635
PARK SANG-GU

620
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,054
"Did you provide us with a place to sleep
when we had none?"

621
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,348
OBSERVED CHIJON FAMILY TRIAL

622
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,267
"Or did you give us a job
when we had none?"

623
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,478
"Did you give us food
when we were starving?"

624
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,772
"What right do you have
to pass judgment on us?"

625
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,819
They hurled insults and abuse
at the judges.

626
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,072
When the judge asked
for his closing statement,

627
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,325
he'd just blame his art teacher.

628
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,536
That's not exactly repentance, is it?

629
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,164
"My teacher would beat me
if I didn't bring art supplies,

630
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:45,126
but the next time, when I stole them
and brought them, he didn't beat me."

631
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,253
DEFENDANT

632
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,298
"So what did I learn in school?"

633
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,925
"I learned to steal."

634
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,221
"I'm living my life
based on what my teacher taught me."

635
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,643
At first, he was posturing
about leaving this world 30 years early.

636
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,395
But then he blamed his teacher,

637
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,900
as if the shock had set him
on the wrong path,

638
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,944
which led him to where he was.

639
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
Hearing that,

640
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,908
I realized all the things he said before
were just posturing.

641
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:33,425
I got pretty close to them over the week
we spent in the detention center.

642
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,973
I guess they remembered
how kind I was to them.

643
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,478
They wrote me letters,
and Kang Dong-eun later even wrote,

644
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,854
"Detective Ko,

645
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,440
I'm letting go of everything now

646
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,652
and realizing the error of my ways."

647
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,822
BUT AFTER ACCEPTING JESUS AS MY SAVIOR,
I PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS OF MY SINS

648
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,074
PLEASE LET PEOPLE KNOW
WE ARE NO LONGER THE CHIJON FAMILY

649
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,286
"All of us are no longer the Chijon Family

650
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,370
but the Heaven Family."

651
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,956
WE'RE LIVING AS THE HEAVEN FAMILY

652
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,458
How do you feel about your mother?

653
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,671
My mother? I regret
not being able to kill her myself.

654
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,715
I asked him directly if he still regrets

655
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,302
not killing his mother
before going to prison.

656
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,346
He told me his father died
when he was in fifth grade.

657
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,266
If I remember correctly,
it was his father's friend.

658
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,477
He said his mother abandoned him
and his two siblings for that man.

659
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,772
He also said she betrayed his father.

660
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,816
And he said,

661
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,318
"Pastor."

662
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,361
"I loved my mother so much."

663
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,489
"I was so fond of her, Pastor."

664
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,410
And he cried.

665
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,663
There's something he used to say to me.

666
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,206
"Mom."

667
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,834
"Don't you even know
what your own son is up to?"

668
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,838
That's what he would say.
Now that I think about it,

669
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,259
he must've said that
because he was involved in these things.

670
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,721
I apologize to the people of this country

671
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,850
for all the cruel things my son did.

672
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,061
I don't know what to say.

673
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,399
A person killing another? It's horrific.

674
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,069
To think my own son did that.

675
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,500
I don't know what went wrong with my son.

676
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,003
I don't remember when,
but while sitting in the living room,

677
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,962
he said,

678
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,799
"If it weren't for my family,

679
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,635
I'd run away with you,

680
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,136
Hyo-jin."

681
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:46,307
I heard him say that to me twice.

682
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,935
"I want to run away,

683
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,936
but I can't."

684
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,272
"If I run away, my family will die."

685
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:57,653
Kim Hyeon-yang said that to me,
smiling as he looked at me.

686
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,950
He told me that on that day.

687
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,994
About the two of us running away.

688
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,872
Then he went on

689
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,043
to confess his feelings for me.

690
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,214
"Is it okay for me to love you?"

691
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,467
I think that's how he asked me.

692
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,637
When I didn't reply, he said, "I get it."

693
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:29,727
"It's ridiculous for someone like me
to even dare love you, Hyo-jin."

694
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,022
"In the outside world, you wouldn't even
look at someone like me twice."

695
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,524
At that moment,

696
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,863
I got the feeling
that he was already regretting it.

697
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,284
Regretting continuing
with what they were doing.

698
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:51,165
He said he wanted to run away with me
and live somewhere far away, if he could.

699
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,378
He hung his head as he said,
"But it's just a vain hope, isn't it?"

700
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,464
Even then,

701
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,301
I felt he had a change of heart.

702
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:06,096
I definitely felt that in both instances.

703
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,861
Ms. Lee Hyo-jin's feelings
toward Mr. Kim Hyeon-yang

704
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,405
seem to have been shaped by his words
and actions suggesting he might spare her.

705
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,407
KO NA-MU
FORMER REPORTER, CEO AT FACTSTORY

706
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,702
I think she kept that with her
for a long time.

707
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,830
He left his belongings with her
when he went to see the doctor,

708
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,041
which made no sense at all.

709
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:39,670
Ms. Lee Hyo-jin seemed to wonder

710
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:44,509
if Kim Hyeon-yang truly intended
or had the will to spare her life,

711
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,013
feeling psychologically conflicted
about it.

712
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,351
Even if he'd intended to let her live,

713
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:57,897
all the crimes he had committed beforehand

714
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:02,611
were truly heinous crimes in themselves,
beyond redemption.

715
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,572
I've come across
a number of articles and content

716
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,407
that interpret the relationship

717
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,494
between Ms. Lee Hyo-jin
and Mr. Kim Hyeon-yang

718
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,621
as if it were simply a romantic one.

719
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,208
I believe such an interpretation shows

720
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,254
a complete lack of understanding
of criminal psychology.

721
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,465
<i>The death penalty for the Chijon Family,</i>

722
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,968
<i>who committed
horrific kidnappings and murders,</i>

723
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,678

724
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,015

725
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,353
<i>The six Chijon Family members,

726
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,439
<i>whose brutal crimes made
national headlines last September,</i>

727
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,442
<i>were executed today.</i>

728
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,999
<i>The female survivor, calm and assertive

729
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,878
<i>lulled her captors
and found a chance to escape.</i>

730
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,464
<i>The police said
Ms. Lee took part in some crimes,</i>

731
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,302
<i>but given that she was coerced
under threat of death,</i>

732
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,388
<i>they decided not to prosecute her.</i>

733
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,684
Without psychiatric medication,

734
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,353
I can barely get through the day.

735
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,356
I take about 15 pills at once.

736
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,694
In the middle of the day, if I feel off,

737
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,280
I take about two more.

738
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,702
I had cancer in both breasts,
so I underwent a double mastectomy.

739
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,831
I also had a hysterectomy.

740
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,586
And I only have one ovary.

741
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,803
People usually meet friends,
grab coffee, go on trips, and eat out.

742
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,306
That's how life goes day-to-day, right?

743
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,977
I've hardly done any of those things
over the past 30 years.

744
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:05,066
To be honest, there's no one around me.
I don't have any friends.

745
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,193
I'm all alone.

746
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:17,913
In a way, I ended up killing everyone
just to survive on my own.

747
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,499
"I took part in all those actions."

748
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,502
That thought filled my mind,
and I blamed myself

749
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,588
for a long time after my escape.

750
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,385
So I even resorted to self-harm.

751
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:37,348
When I wanted to survive,
I did everything I could,

752
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,976
but I did nothing for the other victims.

753
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,853
That thought was hard to bear.

754
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,651
People say it's been 30 years

755
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,115
and that I should have moved on by now.

756
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,494
They can say that because
they haven't lived through what I did.

757
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:02,124
I'll probably be thinking about it
at my last breath.

758
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:11,258
THESE DAYS, I FEEL LUCKY
TO HAVE LIVED THIS LONG AFTER THE INCIDENT

759
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,929
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO, LIKE ME,
WERE VICTIMS AND NOW LIVE IN THE SHADOWS

760
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,100
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT YOUR LIFE HAS MEANING
JUST BY BEING ALIVE

761
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,313
EVEN PEOPLE LIKE ME GO ON LIKE THIS

762
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,612
LASTLY, MAY ALL THE VICTIMS
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES REST IN PEACE

763
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,784
LEE HYO-JIN
SURVIVOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

764
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,502
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

765
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,757
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY
