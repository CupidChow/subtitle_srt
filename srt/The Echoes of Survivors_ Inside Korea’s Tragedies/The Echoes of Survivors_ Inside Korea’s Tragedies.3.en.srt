00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,512
IN THE DOCUMENTARY
,

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,930
RELEASED ON MARCH 3, 2023,

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,559
MAPLE, A WOMAN FROM HONG KONG,
SAID THE FOLLOWING

4
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:24,232
People will have a lot to say about me
if I cry in front of the cameras.

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,901
They'll say I'm putting on an act.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,279
I am not

7
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,115
afraid of dying.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,745
It would actually be better if someone

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,788
killed me.

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,418
SHE RISKS HER LIFE TO GIVE HER TESTIMONY

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,214
You've been following us since yesterday
from Incheon Airport. Who are you?

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,841
Who are you?

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,471
Who is it?

14
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,474
Who is it?

15
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,604
To be honest, I'm terrified.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,692
AND HE HAS TO STOP HER FROM TESTIFYING

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>Wow, you have such wide hips.</i>

18
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,072
<i>You have such wide hips, Soo-jeong.</i>

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>Did you come?</i>

20
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,116
<i>Did you come? Did you?</i>

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>I think I came, like, 50 times.</i>

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>Fifty times.</i>

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,416
THE UGLY TRUTH BEHIND THE DIVINE MESSIAH
IS REVEALED

24
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,171
I love you, honey!

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,839
Have you heard of "picking a fruit"?

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,132
"Don't eat the pussy."

27
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,593
"Don't touch the dick."

28
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,553
<i>He put his hand on my genitals
and started praying.</i>

29
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,263
<i>"The Lord is telling me to examine you."</i>

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,307
<i>There was a news broadcast
about a huge fire.</i>

31
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,061
<i>He said, "What a waste of pussies."</i>

32
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,356
<i>"This isn't a sexual crime.
You're merely receiving the love of God."</i>

33
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,816
<i>"You should be thankful."</i>

34
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,901
Jeong Myeong-seok said
something like this.

35
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,530
"My goal is to rape 10,000 women."

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,283
INSIDERS FINALLY SPEAK UP

37
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,621
I was in the car that was following you.

38
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:08,002
I felt terrible after hearing
that things had gotten harder for Maple.

39
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,173
AND SOME STILL DEFEND THEIR LORD

40
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,759
What kind of police officer refuses
to open the door?

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,718
Open the door.

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,470
Why is no one talking? I'm here.

43
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,680
Please talk to me.

44
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,889
Protecting your own?

45
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,142
Did you defend the people?
Is Maple a criminal?

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,521
Why did you create a manual
for handling Maple's case?

47
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:46,666
SEOUL
NOVEMBER 2023

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>Hello?</i>

49
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,754
<i>Is this Mr. Jo?</i>

50
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,090
<i>Yes, that's me.</i>

51
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,759
<i>I thought a lot
about whether I should call you.</i>

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
<i>Right.</i>

53
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,472
<i>My job is to dig up information on people.</i>

54
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,432
<i>I see.</i>

55
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,936
<i>I recently had a client ask me
to look into you.</i>

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,104
<i>Okay.</i>

57
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:14,401
<i>So have you covered a story
about a cult recently?</i>

58
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,320
<i>Yes.</i>

59
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:20,782
<i>I felt we might be in danger
if we went any further.</i>

60
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,825
<i>I see.</i>

61
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,578
<i>I'm calling you instead to let you know.</i>

62
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,040
<i>Who were they,
and what did they ask you to find out?</i>

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,957
<i>They're no ordinary guys.</i>

64
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,375
<i>What's the name again?</i>

65
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,376
<i>Jeong Myeong-seok?</i>

66
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,836
<i>Yes, Jeong Myeong-seok.</i>

67
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,795
<i>Right.</i>

68
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,715
<i>Well, would you like to meet
and talk in person?</i>

69
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,800
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

70
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,478
CHO HOON-RAE, PRIVATE DETECTIVE

71
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,024
I've received a couple of calls
since early November.

72
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,027
They sent me your phone number

73
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:01,282
and the lieutenant's number
at Chungnam Police.

74
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,660
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 800

75
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,786
PRODUCER JO SEONG-HYEON
MBC NETFLIX

76
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,830
LIEUTENANT CHO SO-HYEON
CHUNGNAM POLICE

77
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,672
<i>Who exactly are these people?</i>

78
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,299
<i>One is a police officer,
and the other is a producer.</i>

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,009
<i>Yes, he's a producer.</i>

80
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,803
<i>What producer? A Netflix producer?</i>

81
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>Don't they make movies?</i>

82
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,182
<i>- He works in investigative journalism.
- Investigative?</i>

83
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,559
<i>- Yes.
- What's that?</i>

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,853
<i>Things like tracking people down
and digging up dirt.</i>

85
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,189
<i>You must've done something wrong, sir.</i>

86
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,816
<i>No, not me.</i>

87
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,278
<i>He did something wrong,
so I need to look into it.</i>

88
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,281
But then I found out Jeong Myeong-seok,

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,325
the cult leader
who committed sexual assault,

90
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,788
had all these followers
who had made the calls.

91
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,000
So I wasn't sure whether to take this job.

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,919
Here's the deposit they paid me
to take the job.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,045
THAT'S FINE

94
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,589
TRANSACTION DATE: NOVEMBER 19, 2023
TOTAL AMOUNT: 8,000,000 WON

95
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,759
They sent me eight million won.

96
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,723
And after 27 years in this line of work,
having been through thick and thin,

97
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,517
I knew this job was trouble.

98
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,189
I had a feeling returning the money
wouldn't be the end of it.

99
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,152
So I looked you up, Mr. Jo.

100
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,613
I saw you were receiving
many death threats,

101
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,741
and bad people were looking into you,

102
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,952
so I figured you should be on guard.

103
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,416
I have two weapons for self-defense.

104
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,084
One is a collapsible baton,

105
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,962
and the other is a stun gun.

106
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,673
Whenever I got home late at night,

107
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,386
I carried the stun gun
and the baton with me.

108
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,390
But I realized the danger was greater
this time around.

109
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,731
- What is it?
- There's a big black vehicle.

110
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,567
- It was in front of us, engine running.
- Right.

111
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,652
I see.

112
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,699
Hang on. It's stopped right there.

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,535
- They're over there.
- They're waiting.

114
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,120
Is that the same car you saw?

115
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,706
- And it's not moving?
- No.

116
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,003
They left as soon as they spotted us.

117
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,222
- There's another one behind us.
- Another one?

118
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,015
- Which one?
- The SUV.

119
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,689
Excuse me.

120
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,029
Excuse me. Could you open up?

121
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,657
Why do you keep following us?

122
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,282
Just talk to us.

123
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,245
Why are you following us?
You're tailing us now.

124
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,122
Aren't you tailing us?

125
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,624
If not, tell us.

126
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,878
Why are you following us?
Open up so we can talk.

127
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,261
In 1997,

128
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:14,267
I was a victim of an assault
that left me with 30 stitches on my face.

129
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,605
KIM DO-HYEONG AFTER THE ATTACK

130
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,316
Those bastards even came
to my wife's workplace

131
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,696
and left a note saying,
"We won't just sit and watch anymore."

132
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,115
They posted publicly online,

133
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:35,413
threatening to cut me
into hundreds of pieces with a knife.

134
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,624
"Even if we cut Kim Do-hyeong's penis
into hundreds of pieces,

135
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,251
we'd be innocent."

136
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,089
"Kim Do-hyeong, did you forget
what happened 20 years ago?"

137
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,223
OCTOBER 29, 2003
THE ASSAULT ON KIM DO-HYEONG'S FATHER

138
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:04,650
This is a smartwatch
the police gave me for my safety.

139
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,403
"Some even die for their God."

140
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,573
ONE MONTH BEFORE THE FIRST VERDICT
IN JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S TRIAL

141
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,493
"Who are you to stop me?"
It's my own body."

142
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,415
Some have become martyrs for God,
out of love.

143
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,047
They used their bodies
to achieve the greater good.

144
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>The scum, the evil, the wicked,</i>

145
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>they will be thrown
into the eternal fires of hell.</i>

146
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,519
<i>And the righteous shall shine
as brightly as the sun.</i>

147
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,982
The key evidence! The recordings!
They turned out to be fabricated!

148
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,778
Try him based on evidence!
Stop the biased media coverage!

149
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,112
Stop the biased media coverage!

150
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,116
AUGUST 20, 2023, RALLY AT CITY HALL
FOR A FAIR TRIAL FOR JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

151
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,454
If this message is conveyed incorrectly,
it could cause serious trouble.

152
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:04,000
Some might think, "I'll sacrifice myself,"
and then go through with it.

153
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,419
RALLY FOR A FAIR TRIAL
FOR PASTOR JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

154
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,049
That's why I think it should be disbanded.
Otherwise, this will never end.

155
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,639
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

156
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:07,898
DAEJEON
DECEMBER 2023

157
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,539
Look at all those people.

158
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,959
Look at all these cultists.

159
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,378
They even brought speakers.

160
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,090
They are trying to find
Pastor Jeong guilty without any evidence...

161
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,593
1ST TRIAL VERDICT ANNOUNCEMENT
OF THE JEONG MYEONG-SEOK CASE

162
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,889
...based only on media stories
and the complainant's claim.

163
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,810
The pastor has been falsely accused
and is facing an unfair trial.

164
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,978
NO CLEAR EVIDENCE AT ALL!

165
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,649
By law,
Pastor Jeong Myeong-seok is not guilty!

166
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
He's not guilty!

167
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,862
As we drove past the courthouse,
I saw signs reading...

168
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,781
WE PLEAD FOR PASTOR JEONG'S INNOCENCE

169
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,907
STOP THE PUBLIC WITCH HUNT

170
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,452
..."Pastor Jeong was falsely accused.
The recording is fake."

171
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,037
Those people always bring up
the recording...

172
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,081
INVESTIGATE MBC AND NETFLIX
OVER FABRICATED CONTENT

173
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,543
...claiming it was fabricated
and edited to mislead.

174
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,129
A TRIAL BY PUBLIC OPINION WITHOUT EVIDENCE

175
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,507
HE HAS SUFFERED UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF IT

176
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,050
That infamous recording,

177
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,595
"Did you come? Did you?
I think I came, like, 50 times."

178
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,183
JMS insists that the recording
is completely fabricated.

179
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,979
Their clever excuse was
that it was an AI-generated voice.

180
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,524
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 1
THE RECORDING IS OF AN AI-GENERATED VOICE

181
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,901
Then they said he had diarrhea 50 times

182
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,945
after drinking the spring water
at Wolmyeongdong.

183
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,071
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 2

184
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,031
50 BOUTS OF DIARRHEA
AFTER DRINKING SPRING WATER

185
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,992
They changed their story again,
claiming he urinated 50 times.

186
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,498
JMS COUNTER-ARGUMENT 3
IT WASN'T DIARRHEA. HE URINATED 50 TIMES

187
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,294
Urinating 50 times would land you
in the ICU or ER from dehydration.

188
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,927
First of all...

189
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,350
MAPLE
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

190
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,106
I've actually

191
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,695
regretted appearing in the documentary
<i>In the Name of God</i>.

192
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,577
I wore a mask everywhere for a while,
in case someone recognized me.

193
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,957
I never thought
that acknowledging the abuse

194
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,793
and speaking about it to people...

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,426
would lead to so much criticism and hate.

196
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,682
"She joined a cult

197
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,851
because she was stupid."

198
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,852
Or they'd say,

199
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,191
"She just went on Netflix
to become famous."

200
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,571
People say I sued Jeong Myeong-seok
because Professor Kim Do-hyeong paid me.

201
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,033
Or that I'm crazy.

202
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,996
Or that there are issues
with my sexual orientation.

203
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,539
Or that I'm Satan,

204
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,543
betraying God and selling out the Lord
for my own gain, like Judas.

205
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,671
SHE'S AKIN TO JUDAS ISCARIOT
WHO BETRAYED JESUS!

206
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,474
I can handle it
if I'm the only one struggling.

207
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,144
Then I could just hold it all in...

208
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,942
and everything would be okay.

209
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,655
But I feel so bad
about the pain I've caused my family.

210
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,241
For how I affected

211
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,619
their lives.

212
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,315
EXODUS
GREAT ESCAPE

213
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,378
I'm...

214
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,839
32 years old.

215
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,716
C
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

216
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,053
I was converted at 18

217
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,181
and left the church at 30.

218
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,894
Have you watched <i>In the Name of God</i>?

219
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,812
Yes.

220
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,609
I saw it as soon as it was released.

221
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,821
You know how it starts
with Jeong Myeong-seok's voice?

222
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,699
<i>Did you come? Did you?</i>

223
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,036
<i>Did you squirt?</i>

224
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,247
<i>I think I came, like, 50 times.</i>

225
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,749
<i>Fifty times.</i>

226
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,841
When I heard that,
my heart started racing.

227
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,761
It just felt so strange.

228
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
It sounded like he was talking to me.

229
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,226
Because I knew exactly what was going on.

230
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,981
For one thing, he said things like,
"Did you squirt?" a lot.

231
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:48,029
While touching me down here,
he said, "This is a pleasure spot."

232
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,116
Then he would say, "You are delicious,"

233
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,994
comparing me to ripe fruit.

234
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,168
WOLMYEONGDONG, JMS HEADQUARTERS
GEUMSAN, CHUNGCHEONGNAM-DO

235
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,589
There's a house with a red roof
behind Wolmyeongdong.

236
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:15,807
He told me
it had very clean mountain water.

237
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,560
He said he went there every day
to wash up.

238
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,614
He told me to follow him inside.

239
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,410
When I did,
Jeong Myeong-seok locked the door.

240
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,207
Then his eyes suddenly went wild,

241
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,836
and he climbed on top of me
like an animal.

242
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,009
While he was doing it,
he kept asking, "Do you like that?"

243
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,597
He bit my breasts so hard...

244
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,852
that they were bleeding afterward.

245
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,834
B
SECOND-GENERATION JMS MEMBER

246
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,255
EXPERIENCED FIRST SEXUAL VIOLENCE
AT AGE 14

247
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:45,063
As soon as I started watching it
on Netflix,

248
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,024
I was really shocked.

249
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,859
I cried a lot.

250
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,321
I think I cried a lot.

251
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,533
It brought back forgotten memories

252
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:01,288
of what I went through as a child.

253
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,748
Every night,

254
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,712
I had dreams of Jeong Myeong-seok
and Jeong Jo-eun chasing me.

255
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,549
And...

256
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,430
I constantly felt like I wanted to die.

257
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,025
I was first assaulted
in my second year of middle school.

258
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,779
The older girls called me over,
dressed me in a school uniform,

259
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,739
and sent me into the room.

260
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,827
So I went in and met the leader.

261
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,245
Since it was so late at night,

262
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,163
I spent the night there

263
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:48,168
and went to school on time in the morning.

264
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,297
I went to the bathroom

265
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,095
and noticed blood on my underwear.

266
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,640
But my head had been filled
from a young age

267
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:08,855
with the idea that Jeong Myeong-seok
was God, the Messiah, and all that,

268
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:14,528
so it never occurred to me
that what he'd done was wrong.

269
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,241
Did your parents know their daughter
was being sent to his room that day?

270
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,750
Yes, they did.

271
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,799
I think my mom knowingly

272
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,302
sent me there.

273
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,019
What he did was so perverted.

274
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,440
If he actually loved me,
he wouldn't have done that.

275
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,985
It was just so disgusting.

276
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,910
Almost everything Maple said
during her interviews

277
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,580
made me feel like I was in her shoes.

278
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,498
As a victim myself...

279
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,000
H
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

280
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,046
...I knew exactly
what Maple was talking about.

281
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,718
JMS once used to be everything to Maple.

282
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,765
The fact she had the courage to speak up
despite all the shame is incredible.

283
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,644
PRESS CONFERENCE OF THE VICTIMS
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY JMS LEADER

284
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,232
There's absolutely no way
Jeong Myeong-seok is the Messiah.

285
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,778
And JMS is not a place
that is fulfilling God's will.

286
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,909
I was grateful to her
for taking the initiative like that.

287
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,746
That's why I sued Jeong Myeong-seok.

288
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,211
After I appeared in Season 1,

289
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,590
21 other victims stepped up

290
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,427
and joined the lawsuit.

291
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,184
Twenty-one people like me came forward.

292
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,375
This is the house with the red roof

293
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,587
where Maple and the other victims
were assaulted.

294
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,299
It's in ruins.

295
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,259
Divine justice.

296
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,973
<i>While investigating
JMS leader Jeong Myeong-seok,</i>

297
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,018
<i>who was arrested
for sexually abusing female followers,</i>

298
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,814
<i>the prosecution and police
carried out a raid on the organization.</i>

299
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,694
We managed to secure all kinds of evidence
from that search and seizure.

300
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,406
Among those were handwritten letters
from Jeong Myeong-seok.

301
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,286
These are letters Jeong Myeong-seok wrote

302
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,787
to the outside world,

303
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,542
which were obtained
during the search and seizure.

304
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,212
Do I have to read this out loud?

305
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,135
"Let's recruit the prettiest bitches."

306
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,476
He didn't say "prettiest girls."
He said "prettiest bitches."

307
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,104
"How sweet and arousing your tongue is."

308
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,483
"Your kisses should be analyzed."

309
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,777

"You have to reach the end

00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,994
(BESIDE A DRAWING
OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MIDDLE FINGER)

314
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,457
"Or you'll never feel it."
He wrote things like this in the letters.

315
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,127
He's just a sick person

316
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,130
whose head is completely filled with sex.

317
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,551
That's all he thinks about,
24 hours a day.

JMS LEADERSHIP MEETING
CHURCH OF JEONG JO-EUN, 2ND-IN-COMMAND

331
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,063
I had a vague idea.

332
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,275
I pleaded with Pastor Jeong
for three and a half years.

333
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,153
I cried every single day.

334
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,905
I told him this wasn't God's will.

335
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,408
That there was no way it could be.

336
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,455
I prayed every day,
fearing this would bring down Providence.

337
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:22,252
I said everything I could
and did my best to stop him at all costs.

338
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:31,011
I tried to keep women from coming
within three meters of Pastor Jeong.

339
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,557
I don't know where those tears came from.

340
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,729
She's a real natural at theatrics.

341

H, FORMER FOLLOWER
FORMER JMS ATTENDANT

342
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,112
I thought this was my chance
to spread the truth.

343
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,574
I agreed to the interview

344
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,871
to share my experience
and reveal the truth about Jeong Jo-eun.

345
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,331
I felt I had to...

346
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,501
W, APPEARED IN SEASON 1
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

347
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,377
...expose Jeong Jo-eun.

348
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,464
Expose her true nature.

349
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,799
And the things she has done
outside the country.

350
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,260
That's why I'm here.

351
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,139
There's nothing holy
about that evil bitch.

352
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,269
AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 2018
HIS CONCERT AS JOSHUA JEONG

353
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,689
Thank you for not only composing,
writing, directing, and singing,

354
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,778
but also delivering
such divine conducting in tonight's show.

355
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:39,620
I warmly welcome you
to the Joshua Jeong concert, If I Do It,

356
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,542
featuring the world's greatest composer
and singer.

357
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,266
SYMBOLIC FIGURE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

AMY, APPEARED IN SEASON 1, AUSTRALIAN
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

360
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,009
JEONG JO-EUN, AMY

361
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,828
I rarely give out this award.

362
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,207
The Faithful Follower of Love Award.

363
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,961
So she will have a new name.

364
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,422
Her name is...

365
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,633
Yes.

366
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,342
She'll have a new name.

367
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,178
Her new name is Jeong Hawwah.

368
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,430
Yes.

369
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,058
She was a messenger of God there.

370
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,436
If Jeong Myeong-seok was the Lord,

371
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,064
then Jeong Jo-eun
was truly like the Holy Spirit.

372
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,649
N
SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN JMS

373
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,695
The Holy Spirit took me in one hand
and Jo-eun in the other

374
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,949
and then brought his hands together
while holding ours.

375
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,035
That's how Jo-eun came to be.

376
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,663
<i>Masterpiece of a Lifetime.</i>

377
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,747
Jeong Jo-eun was the symbol of JMS.

378
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,792
A TRUE MASTERPIECE OF A LIFETIME!
APPLAUSE, PLEASE!

379
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:35,921
She was the symbol, standard,
and role model set by Jeong Myeong-seok.

380
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,466
"Everyone has to be like Jo-eun."

381
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,636
"I hope everyone can follow
Jo-eun's example."

382
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,099
In 1999,

383
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,936
Jeong Myeong-seok first fled overseas.

384
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,313
In December 2005...

385
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,023
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S VILLA IN CHINA
DURING HIS FLIGHT

386
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,277
...just before Christmas,

387
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,989
I visited his villa in Qianshan, China.

388
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,452
To tell you a bit about Christmas,

389
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,288
each department prepared for it,

390
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:14,502
since we were all expected
to give glory to God.

391
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,684
It turned out Jeong Jo-eun had prepared
something of her own too.

392
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,062
She apparently learned choreography
from an expert and practiced hard.

393
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,192
She even showed up in a flashy outfit.

394
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,443
Jeong Jo-eun took the stage,

395
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,655
dimmed the lights,
and put on a one-person show.

396
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,617
She climbed onto Jeong Myeong-seok,
who was sitting on the sofa,

397
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,247
and kept grinding on him,
dancing in a way that resembled sex.

398
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,258
<i>How was it, Apostle Jo-eun?</i>

399
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,928
<i>He has never seen me dance.</i>

400
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,138
<i>She still has a lot to practice.</i>

401
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,933
<i>What did you think about my dance?</i>

402
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,893
<i>- It was good.
- Really?</i>

403
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,899
I'm in that Christmas video too.

404
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,069
Before that night,
♪ always sat beside the leader,

405
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,614
but now Jeong Jo-eun was next to him,

406
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,659
and *** was sitting on the floor.

407
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,872
That's when I realized

408
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,708
something had changed.

409
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,004
That was the moment
she seized all the power for herself.

410
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,344
There was an intercom in the girls' room.

411
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,138
You could use it to speak to Jo-eun.

412
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,640
Then she'd ask,

413
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,601
"Who wants to go tonight?"

414
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,855
She'd call to ask us.

415
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,861
We called it "overnight duty."

416
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,030
You had to spend the night with him.

417
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,909
In other words,
it means having intercourse.

418
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,704
Engaging in sexual acts.

419
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:19,210
Jeong Jo-eun managed
all the women's entries and exits.

420
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,339
She knew exactly
what happened to the girls

421
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,551
when they entered that room.

422
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:32,806
She was the one who gave vaginal tablets
to the girls afterward

423
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,768
when they experienced
swelling and inflammation down there.

424
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,857
I realized
that Jeong Jo-eun handpicked those

425
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:46,905
whom she could completely trust,
and then trained and educated them,

426
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,198
all for that exact purpose.

427
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,411
It was a cruel act, like tossing prey

428
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,917
into a locked room
with a sex-addicted old man.

429
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,631
God, Holy Spirit, Lord of the Eucharist.
I love you.

430
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,674
Please let me hold you.
Can I hold you now?

431
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,010
I'm burning up.

432
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:15,807
Offer every bit of your love
to the Holy Trinity.

433
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,725
Amen.

434
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,811
We must give our hearts, lives, and bodies

435
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,564
to love our husband,
the Holy Trinity, our Lord.

436
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,482
Amen.

437
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,318
Let's offer our carnal and romantic love
to the Holy Trinity.

438
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,779
- Do you believe?
- Amen.

439
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,325
I found out later

440
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:38,164
that nearly all the victims
had been abused in similar ways.

441
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,125
The girl who ordered me...

442
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,335
MAPLE
JEONG JO-EUN

443
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:48,967
...to stay by Pastor Jeong's side
and guard him.

444
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,095
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL
SEASON 1

445
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,429
We were near Wolmyeongdong

446
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,766
when I was asked
to come alone to Cheonggiwa.

447
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,811
When I went there, J was there too.

448
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,773
She told me,
"Soo-jeong, I need to go to Seoul today."

449
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,776
"You should sleep next to him."

450
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,613
"And tell me if anything happens."

451
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,037
That J is none other than Jeong Jo-eun.

452
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,874
Jeong Jo-eun is his biggest accomplice.

453
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,214
She selected girls
Jeong Myeong-seok would like

454
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,634
and placed them by his side.

455
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,222
And she kept the girls under control,

456
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,350
saying, "This isn't sexual harassment
or assault."

457
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,729
Or she'd say, "This is the Lord's love."

458
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,608
She kept reinforcing the idea to us.

459
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,657
Jeong Jo-eun was the one
who created the entire system.

460
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,250
FROM LAYPERSON TO SECOND-IN-COMMAND

461
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:11,883
THE HOLY SPIRIT WHO PROTECTED THE MESSIAH

462
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,350
1999
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FLEES OVERSEAS

463
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:29,107
After Jeong Myeong-seok fled overseas
for the first time in 1999,

464
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,778
while he was staying in Malaysia...

465
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,990
We're currently in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,

466
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,494
at a hotel swimming pool.

467
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,539
He told the members in Korea to come.

468
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,417
People were literally lining up
to get on the plane back then.

469
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,837
And Jeong Jo-eun was one of them.

470
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,133
WHEN JEONG JO-EUN JOINED JMS

471
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,344
As far as I know,
she was recruited by JMS in the '90s

472
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,055
while still in high school.

473
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,977
Jeong Jo-eun was a tall girl.
She was exactly Jeong Myeong-seok's type.

474
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,984
She was then sexually assaulted
by Jeong Myeong-seok

475
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,611
and somehow went on

476
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,949
to become an accomplice
in his spree of sexual offenses.

477
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:24,247
Jeong Myeong-seok
first fled the country in 1999,

478
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,917
and by 2003,
when he was arrested in Hong Kong,

479
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
Jeong Jo-eun was there with him.

480
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:32,797
Come out here.

481
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,132
- Come out.
- What's coming out?

482
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,050
Get out, asshole.

483
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,970
What are you doing?
Why are you filming this?

484
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,429
- Huh? You kicked me?
- Hey, no. It's fine.

485
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,517
Hey, why are you putting your hands on me?
Why, huh?

486
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,980
When Jeong Myeong-seok was arrested
at his hideout

487
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:54,317
and placed in the back
of a Hong Kong immigration microbus,

488
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,530
Jeong Jo-eun was also arrested
and put on the same bus.

489
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,535
On the bus, Jeong Jo-eun spotted
Exodus members through the window.

490
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,707
This is what Jeong Jo-eun did
when she saw the Exodus members.

491
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,011
She was taken to immigration
with Jeong Myeong-seok,

492
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,096
and in the office,

493
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,516
she reportedly screamed
at the top of her lungs in Korean.

494
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,978
"Arrest me too!"

495
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,690
The immigration staff
didn't even speak Korean.

496
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,945
So who do you think
Jeong Jo-eun was screaming in Korean for?

497
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,659
She single-handedly fought them all,
including their boss.

498
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,870
"I'll kill you. Don't kill the pastor."

499
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,622
"He was sent by God."

500
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,041
"He's my savior. How can you kill him?"

501
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,710
"I'm going to kill you too."

502
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,339
She fought them all. It was incredible.

503
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,800
From then on, Jeong Myeong-seok gave her
his full support,

504
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:06,098
and Jeong Jo-eun became known
within JMS as "Apostle."

505
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,144
When we were in China,

506
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,190
Jeong Myeong-seok sat
with Jeong Jo-eun beside him,

507
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,152
and the older girls
were crying on their knees.

508
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:25,076
"Jo-eun is not someone you can
just casually call by her name like that."

509
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,330
"She went through hard times with me."

510
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,958
"To disrespect her is to disrespect God."

511
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,419
That's what he said as he made us kneel.

512
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,172
After that,

513
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,426
we weren't allowed to call her by name
and had to call her "Apostle."

514
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,180
We had to call her "Apostle"
and report to her on our knees.

515
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,391
That's how it changed.

516
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:53,062
1999
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FLEES OVERSEAS

517
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,068
2009
FIRST TIME PUNISHED FOR SEX OFFENSE

518
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,946
<i>The Supreme Court's Second Division
upheld...</i>

519
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,239
APRIL 23, 2009

520
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,784
<i>...the ten-year prison sentence
for Jeong Myeong-seok, leader of JMS,</i>

521
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,247
<i>who was convicted
of sexually assaulting female followers.</i>

522
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,835
After Jeong's ten-year sentence
was confirmed,

523
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,589
Jeong Jo-eun rose to a higher status
as the Holy Spirit.

524
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,136
During the ten years
Jeong Myeong-seok was in prison,

525
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,929
she acted as his proxy

526
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,810
and effectively led
the entire JMS organization.

527
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,647
I pray that our God
is never crucified again.

528
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,443
Glory be to the Lord, and may he bring
the earth-shattering rapture

529
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,528
and life upon this world.

530
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:48,241
I pray this in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

531
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,618
- Amen.
- Amen.

532
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,204
She said that Jeong Myeong-seok
was innocent

533
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,707
and had been framed for the sex crimes.

534
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,877
As far as I could tell,

535
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,466
her tearful pleas seemed to grow
the congregation even further.

536
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,183
Jeong Jo-eun

537
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,227
taught us

538
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:20,399
that Jeong Myeong-seok was God,
the Messiah.

539
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,319
Just as Jesus made history
in a foreign land

540
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,030
and returned to Jerusalem,
the land of persecution,

541
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,907
to bear the cross,

542
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:35,455
Pastor Jeong also bore the cross
in Korea's capital region,

543
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,291
the Jerusalem of today.

544
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,214
Jeong Jo-eun said Jeong Myeong-seok went
to prison for crimes he didn't commit.

545
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,257
We were told he was on a mission in China...

546
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,759
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK IN DAEJEON PRISON

547
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,974
...got caught up in a misunderstanding,
ended up in prison in Korea,

548
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,268
and would be released soon.

549
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,860
THE HOLY SPIRIT ABOVE THE MESSIAH

550
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,404
Of all seven days,

551
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,909
Jeong Jo-eun visited Jeong Myeong-seok
every Monday.

552
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,665
Most of the time, she visited him alone.

553
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,043
And he would discuss everything
with Jeong Jo-eun.

554
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,129
F, JEONG JO-EUN'S FORMER DRIVER
FORMER JMS FOLLOWER

555
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,717
Jeong Jo-eun was the only person
who could tell him what he should do.

556
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,720
DECEMBER 2012, GATHERING
DURING JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S IMPRISONMENT

557
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,515
Pastor Jeong should have been here
with us today.

558
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,226
He prayed so much for us yesterday.

559
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:42,105
He prayed for this gathering
to be guided by the Holy Spirit,

560
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,773
as well as for all of Providence.

561
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,735
While he couldn't join us in person,
he is with us in spirit and with the Lord.

562
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,822
I believe he is with us
and will speak to us.

563
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:54,033
Of course, thanks and glory be
to the Holy Trinity and to God,

564
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,828
but I'd also like us
to applaud Pastor Jeong,

565
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,873
who has dedicated his life to us.

566
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,293
In any case,

567
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,629
if Pastor Jo-eun served
as Jeong Myeong-seok's closest proxy...

568
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,631
NAM JUN-GEUN
FORMER SECOND-GENERATION JMS MEMBER

569
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,594
...then being near her was essentially
being near Jeong Myeong-seok.

570
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,851
Everyone was eager to say hello to her.
I've actually been there myself.

571
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:24,315
I also waited in line just to be greeted
by her for a few seconds.

572
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,454
Jeong Jo-eun even said this herself.

573
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,540
"Every time I go on tour,

574
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,961
I make at least 100 million won a day."

575
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,633
On a good day,

576
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:55,846
she'd receive enough money envelopes
to fill a large shopping bag.

577
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:01,477
Some people brought
tens of millions of won in cash.

578
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,441
Jeong Jo-eun got her hands
on all sorts of luxury goods.

579
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,612
The department store even had
a personal salesperson for her.

580
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,740
Obviously, Chanel.

581
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,742
Dior.

582
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,577
Valentino.

583
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,037
VAL*NTINO DRESS
ABOUT 7 MILLION WON

584
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,205
Miu Miu.

585
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,749
MI* MIU TOP AND BOTTOM
ABOUT 5 MILLION WON

586
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,710
And brands selling fancy dresses,
like Giambattista Valli.

587
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,922
GI*MBATTISTA DRESS
ABOUT 5-10 MILLION WON

588
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,508
She'd buy whatever looked nice.

589
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,968
She'd buy whatever she liked.

590
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,972
I think she liked anything luxury brand.

591
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,473
TIFFA*Y & CO. BRACELET
12 MILLION WON

592
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,184
After Jeong Myeong-seok went to prison,

593
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,728
she went to the salon
for her hair and nails,

594
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,941
dressing up in expensive clothes
and carrying designer handbags.

595
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:54,238
She was trying to make herself an idol,
like a K-pop star.

596
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:01,495
She made music, danced,
and filmed music videos.

597
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,254
She put herself forward like a celebrity.

598
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,717
She filmed music videos
and played them during service breaks.

599
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,344
Just like BLACKPINK headlining Coachella,

600
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,847
she'd take the stage
at the end of the festival

601
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,517
and lead everyone
to dance with excitement.

602
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,270
Her tall frame gives her
a commanding presence.

603
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:32,067
I guess that's why
they started idolizing her.

604
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,363
2010
JEONG JO-EUN'S RENAISSANCE PERIOD

605
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,869
2018
"MESSIAH WITH ELECTRONIC ANKLETS" RELEASED

606
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,499
DAEJEON CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

607
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,337
<i>At last, we will meet our Lord,
our beloved.</i>

608
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,548
<i>Our beloved Lord has returned to us,</i>

609
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,925
<i>both in spirit and in the flesh.</i>

610
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,011
<i>Amen!</i>

611
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,811
We can see that the Lord
is as handsome and cool as ever.

612
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,065
Let's confess to him in one simple phrase.

613
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,693
"The Lord is so cool."

614
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,028
So cool.

615
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,157
<i>From the grave</i>

616
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,618
<i>He rose</i>

617
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,412
<i>Having defeated Satan</i>

618
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,999
<i>Triumphant over death</i>

619
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,840
<i>The Lord rose from the dead</i>

620
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,425
Her headache had come back.

621
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,303
Jeong Myeong-seok was likely to rape again
after his release,

622
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,473
which would pose a serious problem.

623
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,727
Naturally, Jeong Jo-eun probably preferred
having Jeong Myeong-seok in prison.

624
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,315
That way, she could do whatever she wanted
without anyone nagging her.

625
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,782
THE HOLY SPIRIT CONTROLS THE MESSIAH

626
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,451
I think everything
that happened to Jeong Myeong-seok

627
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:11,166
was orchestrated by Jeong Jo-eun
and the people she had planted around him.

628
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:18,424
They reported
Jeong Myeong-seok's every move.

629
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,176
"He's on the move after his meal."

630
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,387
"He fell asleep."

631
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,264
"He's meeting someone."

632
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,225
"Don't let Pastor Jeong meet so-and-so."

633
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,854
All of this was done over texts.

634
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:36,775
You can't meet Jeong Myeong-seok
without the attendants' permission.

635
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,111
Just as not everyone can meet a king,

636
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:44,532
you can't meet the Lord,
Pastor Jeong Myeong-seok, so easily.

637
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,409
You need to submit a request

638
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,203
and inform them in advance.

639
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,000
And these attendants
report back to Jeong Jo-eun.

640
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,629
In the end,
Jeong Jo-eun makes all the decisions.

641
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,763
Jeong Myeong-seok once said this to me.

642
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,933
"Jo-eun said
I could only do it with you girls."

643
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,687
"She told me to touch only the girls
she brought to me."

644
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,231
"I can't do it with anyone else."

645
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,821
I thought that senile old man
was spouting nonsense,

646
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,656
but it was true.

647
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,998
If the Holy Spirit
would kindly blow out the candles...

648
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,917
After we sing you "Happy Birthday."

649
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,043
- Why, I...
- Yes.

650
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,128
I'm so happy.

651
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,175
All right.
Shall we wrap up the event here?

652
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,886
I believe you'll be conducting
the next performance.

653
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,931
- Let me announce it.
- Sure.

654
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,185
The JMS organization can only continue

655
00:46:54,186 --> 00:47:00,025
if Jeong Myeong-seok
keeps leading Providence as the Messiah.

656
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:04,112
Without JMS, there is no Jeong Jo-eun.

657
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:10,159
To maintain her authority
and immense wealth,

658
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,539
she absolutely needed Jeong Myeong-seok.

659
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,584
The best way for her
to keep Jeong Myeong-seok under control

660
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:22,506
was probably to keep supplying girls.

661
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,927
Ultimately, Jeong Jo-eun was in control
of Jeong Myeong-seok.

662
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,180
I heard this
from Jeong Myeong-seok himself.

663
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,226
"You guys don't know
how Jo-eun treats me, do you?"

664
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,896
He said Jo-eun yelled at him.

665
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,191
"Listen to me. I'm the Holy Spirit."

666
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,445
Apparently, she actually said that
to Jeong Myeong-seok's face.

667
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,870
CUTTING OFF THE TAIL

668
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,247
JMS LEADER ARRESTED AGAIN AFTER 4 YEARS

669
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,623
AFTER 10 YEARS IN PRISON,

670
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,043
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
COMMITS SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAIN

671
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,045
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK FACES
NEW SEXUAL ASSAULT LAWSUIT

672
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,632
SUED FOR REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE
OF INCAPACITATED PERSONS

673
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,802
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK SEX CRIMES
IN THE SPOTLIGHT

674
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,637
THE AFTERMATH OF "IN THE NAME OF GOD"

675
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:14,765
SEX CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN DESIGNATED
AS HIS WIVES AND "FAITH STARS"

676
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:19,479
Actually, the people in the documentary
aren't the only victims.

677
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,774
Two additional plaintiffs
are waiting to sue,

678
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,484
and one is a minor as well.

679
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:28,530
The follow-up season on Netflix
will focus on that girl.

680
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,658
We need to stop this or it's all over.

681
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,537
I said, "What do you want me to do?
I can't do anything."

682
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,708
"What more can I possibly do here?"

683
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,714
And Pastor Jeong said to me,

684
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,258
"I guess I'll admit to part of it."

685
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,929
Before a group of followers, she denied
involvement in Jeong's sex offenses.

686
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,847
KIM SI-ON, REPORTER
COVERED JEONG JO-EUN'S STORY

687
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,933
PHONE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN KIM SI-ON AND JEONG JO-EUN

688
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,726
<i>-Sex crimes are already rampant here.
- Right.</i>

689
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,103
<i>This is an organization of sex crimes.</i>

690
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,230
<i>Once Pastor Jeong and I go down like this,</i>

691
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,233
<i>this whole organization will implode.</i>

692
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,070
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

693
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,030
"It has nothing to do with me."

694
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:15,076
By saying,
"I wasn't involved in any of this,"

695
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,412
she was, in a way,
selling out Jeong Myeong-seok

696
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,623
to prove she knew nothing.

697
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,251
"Jeong Myeong-seok is guilty,
but I am not."

698
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,588
<i>Do you know</i>

699
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,301
<i>which part of the victims' statements
broke my heart the most?</i>

700
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:35,597
<i>Some younger victims
didn't even realize they were victims.</i>

701
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,391
<i>They didn't know they were assaulted.</i>

702
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,978
<i>Why?
Because they were so young and innocent.</i>

703
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,814
<i>We can't hide this anymore.</i>

704
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,026
<i>This is unacceptable. It's really serious.</i>

705
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,281
6 MONTHS BEFORE THE RELEASE
OF "IN THE NAME OF GOD"

706
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,076
CONVERSATION BETWEEN JEONG JO-EUN
AND AN UNDERAGE VICTIM

707
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,078
<i>You must be shaken up.</i>

708
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,497
<i>To be honest, I was really worried.</i>

709
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,874
FAITH STARS: THOSE WHO DO NOT GET MARRIED
AND SERVE THE LORD

710
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,711
<i>I wondered whether being a Star
required offering myself to Pastor Jeong</i>

711
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,130
<i>physically as well, you know?</i>

712
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,047
<i>Right.</i>

713
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,134
<i>That made me concerned.</i>

714
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,095
<i>So I thought,
"I should ask Pastor Jo-eun about it."</i>

715
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,682
<i>Since you've spent time with him,
I wanted to ask you</i>

716
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,143
<i>so I could understand him better.</i>

717
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,186
<i>I don't want to see him in a sexual way.</i>

718
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,273
<i>I also thought
you could possibly misunderstand it.</i>

719
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,277
<i>I can tell you one thing for sure.</i>

720
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,572
<i>Pastor Jeong is definitely not someone
who would behave</i>

721
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,991
<i>with romantic intentions like other men.</i>

722
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,035
<i>I guess he was just doting on you.</i>

723
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,328
<i>I never asked him myself</i>

724
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,875
<i>because it didn't feel like a man
touching a woman</i>

725
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,754
<i>but more like him showing affection
and friendliness.</i>

726
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,505
<i>-He is adorable, isn't he?
- He is.</i>

727
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,132
<i>Pastor Jeong is so adorable.</i>

728
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,219
<i>How can he be like that?
That's why we love him.</i>

729
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,979
HONG KONG
MAY 25, 2024

730
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,780
Hey, Maple.

731
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,410
- How have you been, Maple?
- Good.

732
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,496
Everything okay?

733
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,291
Were you surprised I showed up?

734
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,751
We need to talk,

735
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,962
but I didn't think it was something

736
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,924
to discuss over the phone or by text,

737
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,802
so I came on such short notice.

738
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:53,443
Jeong Myeong-seok's lawyers
have been asking the court

739
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,405
for a copy of the recording you made.

740
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,326
We told the court it would lead
to severe secondary victimization

741
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,204
and submitted our statement
on three separate occasions.

742
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,083
The prosecutor
also objected to it multiple times.

743
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,085
But a few days ago, without warning,

744
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,880
the court gave them
a copy of the entire thing.

745
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,858
PHONE CALL BETWEEN MAPLE
AND COURT OFFICIAL

746
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,568
<i>If those people
get hold of that recording,</i>

747
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,155
<i>we don't know what they'll do with it.</i>

748
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,117
<i>There's no point in telling me.
You need to submit the papers.</i>

749
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,329
<i>Okay. I'll send it, then.</i>

750
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,663
- <i>But</i>...
- <i>Yes</i>?

751
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,374
<i>Please don't give them the copies</i>

752
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,211
<i>until you receive my papers.</i>

753
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,799
<i>No, you see, that's not for me to decide.</i>

754
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,469
<i>If you actually allow this,</i>

755
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,264
<i>I'll withdraw the suit.</i>

756
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,850
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

757
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,352
<i>This is too much for me.</i>

758
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,237
I think it was
about an hour and a half long.

759
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:26,328
Only a small part of the long recording

760
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,163
was featured on Netflix.

761
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,000
And it's not even the worst part.

762
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,424
There are parts
that are far more vile and disgusting.

763
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,888
The recording I submitted
to the authorities

764
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,350
is like the clothes or underwear I wore
during the assault.

765
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,477
COURT

766
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,315
It's evidence that proves
what I went through.

767
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,320
Allowing them

768
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,907
to make a copy

769
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,450
is no different

770
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,205
from them showing everyone my underwear.

771
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,834
That's how it feels to me.

772
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,214
So they gave the copies

773
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,009
to all three of his lawyers.

774
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,764
Right now...

775
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,311
they're playing it in the lawyers' office
for the followers.

776
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,504
What do I...

777
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,090
what do I do now? I...

778
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,891
All this makes me feel ashamed
to be Korean.

779
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,069
How much more do I have to go through?

780
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,579
Of course, as her father, I was furious.

781
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,999
I was enraged.

782
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,755
I'm not just disappointed in the judge.

783
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,633
Korea needs to reexamine...

784
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,718
MAPLE'S FATHER

785
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,055
...its judicial system.

786
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:56,186
MAPLE'S AUNT

787
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:43,942
MAPLE'S COUSIN

788
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,378
I believe JMS followers are everywhere.

789
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,090
Officers in the army, navy, and air force,
the Board of Audit...

790
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,175
The Prosecution Service,
the NIS, the police...

791
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,513
We have confirmation
that individuals in these organizations

792
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,098
are protecting JMS.

793
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,395
We at Providence
have powerful organizations as well.

794
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,188
A team of lawyers.

795
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,608
Moreover, a group of police.

796
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,362
Law enforcement exists
to serve the people,

797
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:34,074
but protecting Jeong Myeong-seok
was the top priority for them.

798
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,370
Defending Jeong Myeong-seok to the end.

799
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,164
Mr. ***.

800
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,206
- Yes?
- Here.

801
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,335
Why did you lie and say you weren't ***?

802
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:45,920
Well?

803
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,546
Mr. ***.

804
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,839
Mr. Joo Su-ho!

805
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,216
- I'm not Joo Su-ho.
- You're Joo Su-ho, aren't you?

806
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,261
Who were you defending, Officer?

807
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,180
Did you defend the people?
Is Maple a criminal?

808
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,559
Why did you create a manual
for handling Maple's case?

809
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,227
Are you a JMS follower or not?

810
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,771
- I'm not.
- You're not?

811
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,902
You can't come in here. You can't...

812
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,497
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES
