1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,847
Ganggangsullae

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,725
CHUSEOK, 1994

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,394
Let's jump

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,147
Ganggangsullae

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,691
Let's boisterously mingle and jump

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,360
Ganggangsullae

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,946
Let the deep yard become shallow

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,574
Ganggangsullae

9
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,325
Let the shallow yard become deepâ€¦

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,996
"Let every day be like Hangawi," they say.
Today is that Hangawi.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,002
But today, we saw the extremes
of just how cruel humans can be

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,213
as we trembled with fear and rage.

13
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,802
"We gave up on being human."

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,681
During today's crime scene reenactment
at the gang's hideout,

15
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,436
the perpetrators openly admitted
their inhumanity without hesitation.

16
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,230
I'm not human.

17
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,150
I regret not killing
everyone who deserves to die.

18
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,610
That I couldn't kill them all.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,112
Who didn't you get to kill?
Who did you want to kill?

20
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,656
People who have it all.

21
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,704
Kim Hyeon-yang said something to me
similar to what the press had reported.

22
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,790
He said he hated the rich

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,335
and the fact that they enjoyed
many privileges yet wanted even more.

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,880
That was when
college admissions corruption was rampant.

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,134
People were paying their way into college.

26
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,805
Seoul National University was caught
in its first admissions scandal.

27
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,642
These brokers disguised illicit admissions
under names like "surefire tutoring."

28
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,354
They enabled cheating and had others
take exams for higher grades.

29
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,149
Scandals broke out at universities
across the country,

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:53,488
deepening despair and anger
among those already struggling.

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,910
"See? They get into those universities
because they have money."

32
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,621
"They can just hire a lawyer
and walk free."

33
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:07,001
Five students studying abroad,
part of the "Imported Oranges" crowd,

34
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,381
assaulted two people driving a Pride
with objects like bricks and flowerpots.

35
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,802
The assailants are part
of the so-called Imported Orange Tribe,

36
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,972
who return briefly from studying abroad

37
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,225
to bounce around the nightlife in Korea.

38
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,644
The Orange Tribe. The Ya-ta Tribe.

39
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,940
Those were the days
when buzzwords like these were born.

40
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:33,361
In bars, Ballantine's 17-Year-Old
and 21-Year-Old Scotch

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,823
would cost nearly a million won back then.

42
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,450
They would drink bottles of those,

43
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,995
meaning they spent
millions of won in one night.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,791
They'd take their luxury cars,

45
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,961
drive down to the busy streets of Gangnam,

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,674
spot women walking by
who caught their eye,

47
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,302
and say, "Ya, ta,"
which means, "Hey, get in."

48
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,138
That's how they came to be known
as the "Ya-ta Tribe."

49
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,433
The media competed
to report on the phenomenon,

50
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,519
flooding the news with coverage.

51
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,814
"Let's cleanse this corrupt society."

52
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,234
That was the initial intent.

53
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,405
Honestly, it's hard for commoners like us
to earn even a few million won.

54
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,074
But it turns out tons of people
spend that much in a day.

55
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,951
Those who look down on the poor.

56
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,162
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

57
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:28,791
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

58
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,545
Hey! How am I guilty when Chun Doo-hwan
and Roh Tae-woo are innocent?

59
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,881
The laws in this country are fucked up!

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,767
I AM A SURVIVOR
WHO TOOK A LIFE TO SAVE MY OWN

61
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,812
THE ECHOES OF SURVIVORS:
INSIDE KOREA'S TRAGEDIES

62
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,567
Amid the cheer of the Chuseok holiday,

63
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,362
a wave of terror
swept through Hoesan Village.

64
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,949
Residents who gathered to see the scene,

65
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,119
a site of brutal killings
with an on-site incinerator,

66
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,914
trembled with disbelief
that such a thing could happen.

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,918
They committed such evil, atrocious acts.
Are they even human?

68
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,295
Seriously,

69
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,589
something needs to be done about them.

70
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,802
They could've killed so many more
if they hadn't been stopped.

71
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,014
My heart is still racing.

72
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,267
Residents who knew the suspects

73
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,521
still look stunned
by the sheer brutality of their crimes.

74
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:17,150
Even with all the rumors
going around town,

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,485
I never imagined it would be this bad.

76
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,904
We never caught on.

77
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,701
And we had no idea
they were behind crimes like this.

78
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:34,709
KANG DAE-OK, NEIGHBOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY
AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,672
To be honest, it's all been forgotten now,

80
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,925
but the stigma lingered for a long time
among outsiders.

81
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,012
Even ten years ago,
people came to see where it happened.

82
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,557
They'd come in tour buses and say,
"That's the Chijon place."

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,269
Seeing that made us feel
really uneasy and uncomfortable.

84
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,979
So we'd just deny it.

85
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,067
Basically, we covered it up
by saying it was a different house.

86
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,277
That's the life we lived.

87
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,288
Over there.

88
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,040
See over there.

89
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,835
Up to there was a pepper field.

90
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,379
It's about 3,560 square feet.

91
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,882
Maybe 4,270 square feet.
It's worth around 1.8 million won.

92
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,968
It was right here.

93
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,388
Up to here, I think.

94
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,392
Right here was the basement.

95
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,353
From here to there.
The main building was here.

96
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,784
While they were building,

97
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,871
I asked why they were digging,
and they said it was for a basement.

98
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,875
They said, "This would make
a good air-raid shelter too."

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,753
Once it was built,

100
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,006
they had it all locked up
and wouldn't open it for anyone.

101
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,508
They never showed it to anyone.

102
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:12,974
They said digging the basement alone
cost 30 million won.

103
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,979
Most of the perpetrators
were construction workers.

104
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,189
KO BYEONG-CHEON
LEAD DETECTIVE OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

105
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,900
Because they had done
a lot of construction work,

106
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,155
they built the entire house themselves
from scratch.

107
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,907
Where did you get the money
to build this house?

108
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,368
Manual labor. We did manual labor.

109
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,412
You built that house
with money from labor?

110
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,496
Yes.

111
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,874
Did you plan to move your mother in there?

112
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,584
No. We built it to do this.

113
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,960
To do what?

114
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,128
To kill them all.

115
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,218
We crossed the Paldang Bridge.
That's as far as I remember.

116
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,346
Suddenly, the car came to an abrupt stop.

117
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,182
Someone fired a gas gun,

118
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,685
and I thought,
"These people are kidnapping us."

119
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,523
I gave up and thought,
"They are definitely going to kill us."

120
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,403
They got him completely drunk,
then suffocated him with a plastic bag.

121
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,031
-Had the body gone stiff at this point?
-Yes.

122
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,872
Next was a husband and wife
who owned a small business.

123
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,251
This was the couple's car.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,007
Their original demand was 100 million won,
but they ended up extorting 80 million.

125
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:33,429
After handing over the money,
the victim begged them to let his wife go.

126
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,640
He said, "We have young children."

127
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,143
"So my wife has to go home.
You can kill me."

128
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,145
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T HURT
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS

129
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,940
He dropped to his knees
and begged them. Butâ€¦

130
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,280
That night, they were already making plans
to kill the couple.

131
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,043
DAY 8 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 16, 1994

132
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,504
It was the day after

133
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,923
he brought them the money.

134
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,552
They agreed to get the couple drunk,

135
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,555
put them to sleep, and then kill them.

136
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,475
They decided to take turns
giving them drinks.

137
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,853
"Let's just pretend to drink.
Don't actually drink any."

138
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,940
LEE HYO-JIN
LAST SURVIVOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

139
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,652
"They need to be drunk
so they won't know where they're going."

140
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,363
"So just tell them,
'You'll be home in the morning

141
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,241
when you wake up,'
as you give them the drinks."

142
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:41,455
So after getting the couple
completely drunk,

143
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:48,045
they had the survivor come down
to the basement to carry out the crime.

144
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,257
They put a shotgun in her hands
and told her, "Shoot them."

145
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,426
"Only then

146
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,219
can you become

147
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,555
a true member of the gang."

148
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,641
That's how they tried to convince her.

149
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:07,732
I think it was too heavy
for me to hold with both hands.

150
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,233
Soâ€¦

151
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,904
Kim Hyeon-yang

152
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,159
helped me hold it.

153
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,414
He told me to place my finger
on the trigger, so I did.

154
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,249
But

155
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,087
I couldn't bring myself to pull it.

156
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,550
Then Iâ€¦

157
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,902
They told me this right here
was a vital spot.

158
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,154
But I think when they screamed,

159
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,408
the barrel of the gun
must've slipped away from their head.

160
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,997
As I took a few steps back,

161
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,251
Kim Hyeon-yang
pressed up against me again,

162
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,882
lifted the gun again, held my hand,

163
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,219
put my finger back on the triggerâ€¦

164
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,433
pressed my fingerâ€¦

165
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,520
and thenâ€¦

166
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,205
The police investigation

167
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,375
revealed that they murdered
the kidnapped victims in this basement,

168
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,503
dismembered their bodies, and burned them.

169
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,508
In the confinement cell,
the suspects calmly reenacted

170
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,177
how they killed the couple
and dismembered them

171
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,762
with knives and hatchets.

172
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,688
In a desperate,
life-threatening situation,

173
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,566
the victim, a small business owner,
wrote a statement

174
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,444
revealing the brutal nature
of the suspects' interrogation.

175
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,030
Notes written by the perpetrators
were also found with it.

176
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,701
Even as he feared death drawing closer,

177
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:28,038
the victim begged the kidnappers
not to harm his wife and daughters.

178
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,084
"I came from the streets too.
I know you're doing this to survive."

179
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,211
He begged them,
"I can always earn more money,

180
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,921
so I won't try anything funny,"

181
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,382
but in the end, he was brutally murdered.

182
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,011
I WON'T REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE

183
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,891
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T HURT
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS

184
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,351
In the 1,070-square foot basement
of this house,

185
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,021
there is a body incinerator,
1 m by 1 m in size.

186
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,483
In the incinerator
were the remains of two people,

187
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,819
believed to be the kidnapped couple,
along with tools used in the crime,

188
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,654
such as hatchets, knives, and sickles.

189
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,865
The skull was found down there,

190
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,075
and the pelvic bones were over here.

191
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,094
They were worried about the smoke
and the smell coming from the incineratorâ€¦

192
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,806
PARK RAE-YONG
REPORTER, COVERED THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

193
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,891
â€¦so they deliberately grilled pork belly
in the yard

194
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,601
at the same time

195
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,688
to mask the smell.

196
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,194
The day before Chuseok, I came home
after cleaning up our family graves.

197
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,781
When I got home,
I could smell pork grilling.

198
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:49,036
I assumed they were grilling pork
to celebrate Chuseok after finishing work.

199
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,964
DAY 9 OF THE MURDER FACTORY KIDNAPPING
SEPTEMBER 17, 1994

200
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,221
I think that was when I began
to get a grasp on reality.

201
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,933
"If I stay here any longer,
I'll die as well."

202
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,353
The incinerator was ready there,

203
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,607
so I figured it wouldn't be a problem
for them to burn me too.

204
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,986
I didn't sleep a wink,

205
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:27,741
thinking about how I could escape there
before Kim Gi-hwan was out of prison.

206
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,832
While Kim Hyeon-yang
was doing something under the car,

207
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,085
the dynamite exploded in the car,

208
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,671
leaving his hands and feet
already injured.

209
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,636
When Kim Hyeon-yang said in the morning
that he was going to the hospital,

210
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,140
he added that Chijon would be out soon.

211
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,103
Then he shot me a grin
I couldn't understand,

212
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,563
shook his head once,

213
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,983
and told me he had to go to the hospital,

214
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,153
so I'd have to stay there by myself.

215
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,909
I asked, "Can't I go to the hospital
with you and get some fresh air?"

216
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,411
He gave me a lookâ€¦

217
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,459
handed me his wallet, told me to take it,

218
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,588
then grabbed a pile of cash
and asked me to count out 500,000 won.

219
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,762
He said, "Come with me."
I gave him the money and stepped out.

220
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,098
The guys in the yard were like,
"What's going on, bro?"

221
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,393
"Why are you taking her with you?"

222
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,228
"I know what I'm doing, man."

223
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,107
When he said, "Get in, Hyo-jin,"
I opened the door and got in the car.

224
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,110
I thought to myself,

225
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,656
"I won't die by Kim Gi-hwan's hand today."

226
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,995
"Someone outside needs to know I'm dead."

227
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,583
Because I know how they killed the couple
and burned their bodies.

228
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,879
"I won't die like that.
If I die, it'll be out in the street."

229
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,136
We arrived at the hospital,

230
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,973
and Kim Hyeon-yang and I
sat next to each other.

231
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,686
It occurred to me
that he might take me with him

232
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,898
when he entered the hospital room,
asking me to help him in.

233
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,945
But he was just sitting there
when he suddenly said,

234
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,239
"If you want to run away, run away."

235
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,950
"You want to escape, don't you?
You want to run away?"

236
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,077
It was as if he could read my mind.

237
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,421
He slowly walked to the hospital room,

238
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,799
opened the door,
and turned to look at me one last time.

239
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,011
He gave a quick nod,

240
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,306
flashed me a brief smile
with just the corners of his mouth,

241
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,599
then stepped inside.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,108
I thought to myself,
"This must be my fate."

243
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,945
"I'm getting out of here,
even if they're waiting for me outside."

244
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,324
"I'm getting out of this hospital.
If I'm going to die, I'll die outside."

245
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:21,415
As soon as he went inside,
I slowly got up and didn't even run.

246
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,127
If I screamed then,
I'd just draw attention to myself.

247
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,796
So I slowly got up,

248
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,965
went out the main exit,

249
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,218
and decided to head somewhere
with no one around.

250
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,305
There was an alley to the right,

251
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,809
so I ran as if I were in a 100-meter race,
staring straight ahead.

252
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,271
I reached the end of the alley,
and there was a road.

253
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,028
I got into the back seat
of any taxi that was stopped

254
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:55,157
and told the driver I'd been kidnapped,
that they'd killed the other victim,

255
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,534
and I had just managed to escape.

256
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,163
The taxi driver asked who they were,

257
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,249
saying he knew everyone in the area.

258
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,418
"I know everyone in Yeonggwang."

259
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,005
He kept asking,
"Who is it? Tell me, who is it?"

260
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,091
He said he could go help catch them.

261
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,678
Hearing how he underestimated them,
I thought, "No, this isn't right."

262
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,389
And the claim they made before was,

263
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,977
"Almost all the taxi and bus drivers
in this neighborhood

264
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,189
are members of our organization."

265
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,819
That's what they told her,
and recalling it,

266
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,863
she got out of the taxi midway,
at a place with an orchard.

267
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,077
There were farms with pigs and cows.

268
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,246
I was so desperate at that moment

269
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:47,626
that I thought, "Should I hide out
in a pig pen? Or a barn?"

270
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,170
I continued on,
my mind racing with thoughts,

271
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,173
constantly fearing they'd come find me.

272
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,511
Even after escaping,

273
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,305
I didn't feel completely free
from their grasp.

274
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,433
I thought if they searched for me
from town to town,

275
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
they could find me.

276
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,356
I opened the greenhouse
without hesitation.

277
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,568
All I could think was,

278
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,404
"The only good place to hide
is under the platform."

279
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,447
So I decided to crawl in

280
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,325
and keep an eye on the entrance.

281
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,704
That way, I could see
whoever opened the door.

282
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:34,131
I didn't even consider
going to the Yeonggwang Police Station.

283
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,966
Kim Hyeon-yang told me,

284
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,678
"If we ever decide to, we can easily raid

285
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,223
both Yeonggwang Police Station
and the nearby precinct."

286
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:48,103
"We can bring all the weapons
and anything else from there if we want."

287
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,191
Remembering that,
I thought, "I shouldn't go there."

288
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,945
I was really scared then too.

289
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,782
I kept my eyes closed,
but I was too terrified to keep them shut.

290
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,659
After a while, I fell asleep.

291
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,622
I woke up after a while
and noticed it was getting darker.

292
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,209
When I woke up again,
I realized it was pitch dark.

293
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,884
That's when I noticed
the light was on outside.

294
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,594
"Oh, there's a house here."

295
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,307
She came out again after sunset
and found the owner of the house.

296
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,812
She told them
she was being chased by some people

297
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,564
and asked them to call a rental car.

298
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,316
She drove the rental car to Daejeon,

299
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,444
got in a different car there,

300
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,154
and took a taxi to Seoul.

301
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,491
YEONGGWANG, JEOLLANAM-DO

302
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,159
EAST SEOUL TOLLGATE

303
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,622
SEOCHO-GU

304
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,629
THE EARLY MORNING AFTER THE ESCAPE
SEPTEMBER 18, 1994

305
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,517
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

306
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
Everyone thought she was on meth.

307
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,854
Her statement was so wild
that it sounded like fiction.

308
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,067
She was shaking like a leaf,

309
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,735
as if she had a cold.

310
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
OH HU-GEUN
DETECTIVE ON THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

311
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,326
She kept talking about chopping up bodies,
shooting people to death,

312
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,745
dismemberment, and burning the bodies.

313
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,997
She told us

314
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,792
that a murder case was mishandled
as a traffic accident.

315
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,337
That she was the victim who was with him.

316
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,673
We contacted Jangsu Police Station

317
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,719
to check if a traffic accident
like the one she described had occurred.

318
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,972
When they confirmed it,
I realized she'd been telling the truth.

319
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:53,520
With enough circumstantial evidence
to believe it might be true,

320
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,604
we agreed to go.

321
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,066
There were seven of us and five of them.

322
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,277
We didn't have enough people.

323
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,822
We needed at least two of us
for each of them.

324
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,741
We need two people per suspect.

325
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,201
So we talked to a few other colleagues.

326
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,411
But

327
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,414
none of them volunteered to help,

328
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,000
since it was two days before Chuseok.

329
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,671
Even our own squad had someone
trying to skip out because of Chuseok.

330
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,759
That's how shorthanded we were.
There was no one to help us.

331
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,888
So we put everything on the line
and went on our own.

332
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,350
We went there
thinking it would end one way or another.

333
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,519
Either we'd die or catch them all.

334
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,274
We took three cars, two in each.

335
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,110
We had two guns and 12 live rounds.

336
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,114
And back then, detectives kept
beacon lights in their cars.

337
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,367
We put them on the vehicles
and headed out.

338
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,045
I had Hyo-jin in my car.

339
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,048
She was too anxious to stay in her seat
and sat on the floor.

340
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,216
She was trembling.

341
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:09,012
Without Hyo-jin,
we couldn't identify them.

342
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,640
We relied on her help in several ways.

343
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,163
We left Seoul at 9:00 p.m.,
and when we arrived,

344
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,249
it was around 1:30 or 2:00 a.m.

345
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,628
It was pitch dark,
and the neighborhood was so quiet

346
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,925
that the sound of our voices
and the cars coming in

347
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,594
made all the neighborhood dogs
start barking.

348
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,017
DAY OF THE CHIJON FAMILY'S ARREST
SEPTEMBER 19, 1994

349
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,896
When we got there,

350
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,317
the informant got nervous
and lay flat in the backseat.

351
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,362
She said,
"It's that house. That's the one."

352
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,738
I said, "Got it."

353
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,408
"I'll move the car."
And I moved the car back there.

354
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,618
Over there, up ahead.

355
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:18,039
After parking the car up there,
we talked about how to go about it.

356
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,625
"Do we ambush them now
or wait until morning?"

357
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,127
In the endâ€¦

358
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,089
we decided to wait until morning.

359
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:33,722
With binoculars and a walkie-talkie,
I stood by on the farm road.

360
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,603
As the sun started to rise
around 6:00 a.m.,

361
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,230
one person came out of the house.

362
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,483
This one person came out.

363
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,988
He reversed the truck,
opened the door, and stepped out.

364
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,699
We saw his face.
It was Kang Dong-eun without a doubt.

365
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,826
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

366
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,747
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

367
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,751
I told the standby team down there
over the walkie-talkie,

368
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,296
"He's heading that way. Get him."

369
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,595
We were closing in,
fully prepared to ram into his car.

370
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,017
So our car crashed into the truck
with a bang.

371
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,730
Next to the road was a steep slope
about three or four meters high.

372
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,857
Kang ran down it
after getting out of the car.

373
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,651
So we chased after him.

374
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,653
Then we arrested him,

375
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,989
and he confessed on the spot
to everything they had done.

376
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,119
After we arrested Kang Dong-eun,

377
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,251
we couldn't come up with a plan
to arrest the others at that moment.

378
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,547
After a quick thought,
we realized we should lure them outside.

379
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,007
We took Kang Dong-eun
to a nearby precinct.

380
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,891
We explained the situation to them.

381
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,645
We told them we came from Seoul
to arrest the suspect.

382
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,022
After thinking it through,

383
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,150
we decided to lure them out
by saying there was a car accident.

384
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,363
We told the precinct employee
they'd only believe it

385
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,283
if the person on the line
used the local dialect.

386
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,952
We asked them to say
Kang had an accident and was injured.

387
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,746
He needs to go to the hospital,
so someone must come.

388
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,419
We were waiting in our car

389
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,797
when another car drove up right here.

390
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,009
Moon Sang-rok stepped out of the car.

391
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,475
We expected the car to drive in.

392
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,811
Only Moon got out and walked in slowly.

393
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:48,023
We needed the car to drive in,
but we grew impatient when it didn't.

394
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,193
So I chased after him and caught him,
since we couldn't let him escape.

395
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,821
While we were struggling to arrest himâ€¦

396
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,451
Seeing that,
Kim Hyeon-yang started to flee.

397
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,498
We had one car on standby

398
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,834
in case any of them tried to run.

399
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:12,422
Kim Hyeon-yang was on the run,
but when he realized he couldn't escape,

400
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,760
he tried to take his life
by driving the car into a wall.

401
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,514
Fortunately, he didn't die

402
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,976
and was arrested
by the detectives, unharmed.

403
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,982
Afterward, we restrained them with rope
and had them wait.

404
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,859
Then we went to their hideout.

405
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,738
On our way, we requested assistance
from Yeonggwang Police Station.

406
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:41,868
We went in, guns blazing,
to arrest the two people inside,

407
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,912
since they had their own guns.

408
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,331
We went in, firing blanks,

409
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,627
and one of them just put his hands up,
too startled to resist.

410
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,588
The other tried to flee
to the mountain behind the house

411
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,007
but was caught by the mobile unit.

412
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,133
KANG
LEE, HIS LOVER

413
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,635
KIM, MOON, KANG, BAEK

414
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,638
BESIDES LEADER KIM GI-HWAN
SIX CHIJON FAMILY MEMBERS ARRESTED

415
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:10,230
Kang Dong-eun's girlfriend
was working at a place Kang knew.

416
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,775
They said they were worried
after Hyo-jin disappeared

417
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,445
as people might become suspicious
of the woman's disappearance.

418
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,365
They concluded that they needed
a female member.

419
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,786
I think she had a debt of six million won,
which Kang Dong-eun paid off.

420
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,455
In return, he asked her
to cook for him and his friends,

421
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,707
and she agreed.

422
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,501
Even after coming to the hideout,

423
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:35,630
his girlfriend actually had no idea
if they were criminals or up to no good.

424
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,133
So she was charged with aiding a fugitive,

425
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,387
and I think she got out
in about ten or twenty days.

426
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,852
Okay. All done!

427
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,856
Show us your faces!

428
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,319
We found
dozens of different weapons there.

429
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,532
There were
more than ten sticks of dynamite,

430
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,035
a gun with a telescopic sight,

431
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,583
and a cane that could be disassembled
to reveal a blade.

432
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,338
In my 30 years as a detective,
I'd never seen anything like that.

433
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,632
It was truly unbelievable.

434
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,219
I couldn't believe
such a situation existed.

435
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,601
-Have them stand side by side.
-In a row.

436
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,064
I feel like I killed the wrong people,
not the ones I really wanted to.

437
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,859
Who didn't you get to kill?
Who did you want to kill?

438
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,361
People who have it all.

439
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,783
The rich who flaunt their wealth in Seoul.
They made us who we are.

440
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,785
If they keep this up,

441
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,245
people like us won't just stand by.

442
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,955
If you're done filming, move!

443
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,668
Seven young people
form a criminal organization

444
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:01,174
and commit serial murders
targeting the wealthy?

445
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,385
This was an unusual case,

446
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:10,016
not just in Korea
but in the global history of crime.

447
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:15,146
At the time,
even international outlets such as CNN

448
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,981
came to cover the case.

449
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:26,157
Living at rock bottom
and being treated coldly by society,

450
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,829
they said they committed these crimes
to take revenge.

451
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,793
The gap between the haves
and the have-nots is too large.

452
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,171
And the wealthy look down on the poor.

453
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,049
Honestly, the poor will be poor forever.

454
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,428
Kim Hyeon-yang said
he had worked and saved money.

455
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,058
But a fight broke out at a street bar,

456
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,812
and he ended up losing eight million won
in settlement.

457
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,275
He was saying

458
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,238
that the person,
despite already being rich,

459
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,325
took the money he'd worked so hard for.

460
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,621
That person took
the eight million won from him,

461
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,748
even though they didn't need it.

462
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,543
As he was telling me this, he said,

463
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,088
"The rich are greedier.
Those who have more are more selfish."

464
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:26,342
"So even if we can't take their money,

465
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,221
we want to kidnap and kill them."

466
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,389
"That's our wish."

467
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:38,229
After the crime scene reenactment
in Jangsu, Jeonbuk State,

468
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,316
they were transported to Seoul.

469
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,076
I guess I was lucky.

470
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,581
For the first time in history,
a prisoner transport vehicle set off

471
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,958
with both a reporter and suspects
on board.

472
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,255
I sat beside

473
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,424
Kim Hyeon-yang.

474
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,470
I told him I was a reporter
from the Kyunghyang Shinmunâ€¦

475
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,807
and had a few questions.

476
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,311
When I told him that,

477
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,774
the first thing he asked
was to see my wallet.

478
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,904
As I remember,
I didn't have much money on me.

479
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,783
I think I had about 70,000 won,
from what I remember.

480
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,534
Kim Hyeon-yang said,

481
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,704
"You don't have jack shit,"

482
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,414
and added,

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,126
"We were planning to kill
all you reporters too."

484
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:51,803
If I had happened to have a lot of money
in my wallet back then,

485
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:56,641
I might have been classified
as a target to be killed.

486
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,186
"Those rich assholes
who throw their money around."

487
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,146
"Let's take their money."

488
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,149
"And let's rack up a billion won."

489
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,361
"We'll do our best to make a billion won."

490
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,947
That was all they were thinking.

491
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,199
They had no other thoughts.

492
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,951
At Cheonggyecheon,

493
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:19,706
they bought the VIP list
of a high-end department store in Gangnam.

494
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:25,753
A list of 1,300 department store VIPs
acquired by the Chijon Family

495
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,171
has been confirmed.

496
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,465
The list includes
almost the entire social elite,

497
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,759
including high-ranking public officials,

498
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,513
lawmakers, hospital directors,
and executives of major companies.

499
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,182
If the Chijon Family
hadn't been apprehended,

500
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,269
some individuals on this list
would have become their targets.

501
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,772
Have you attempted a crime
against anyone on that VIP list?

502
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,149
We were planning to do so.

503
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,358
So you never tried?

504
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,695
We were planning to do it after Chuseok,
but we've been caught.

505
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,406
After going through the list,

506
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:59,996
they selected a customer
who spent seven million won

507
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,875
in one day as their first target.

508
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,336
How did you obtain
that list of department store customers?

509
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,840
Near Cheonggyecheon.
But I'm not sure which neighborhood.

510
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,842
Cheonggyecheon. So it was in Seoul.

511
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,427
Who introduced you to them?

512
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,847
We meet and complete the transaction
without knowing each other.

513
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,976
In short, how much did you pay the broker
for that list?

514
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,647
Including the other weapons,
it was about five million.

515
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,149
-What?
-Five million.

516
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,028
Where did you hear you could get
those things at Cheonggyecheon?

517
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,446
That's common knowledge.

518
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,864
Common knowledge, huh?

519
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,282
Among many department stores,

520
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,160
you chose Hyundai Department Store
in Apgujeong, right?

521
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,245
That's the wealthy neighborhood.

522
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,331
How many people were you planning to harm?

523
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,999
All 1,200 people on that list.

524
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,964
Honestly, it's hard for commoners like us
to earn even a few million won in a day.

525
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,675
But it turns out tons of people
spend that much in a day.

526
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,428
I only targeted those people.

527
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,055
I never harmed the weak.

528
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,974
I never harmed the weak.

529
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,103
Those who look down on the poor.

530
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,313
The Ya-ta Tribe of Apgujeong-dong!

531
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:12,026
My deepest regret is that I couldn't even
begin to kill them with my own hands.

532
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,403
That's how I feel.

533
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,992
THE SITE OF THE FIRST VICTIM'S EXHUMATION

534
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,787
A HILL NEAR DUGYE STATION
(NOW GYERYONG STATION)

535
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,806
The first victim of the Chijon Family,
murdered to practice killing,

536
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,017
has been identified.

537
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,146
Ms. Choi,
who was even poorer than her killers,

538
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,189
was a sweet country girl

539
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,525
striving hard for her dream.

540
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:57,321
In light of this,
the killers' claims of societal resentment

541
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,198
seem completely disingenuous.

542
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,994
From the first to the fourth crime,

543
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:08,666
they were neither rich, wealthy,
nor part of the upper class.

544
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,170
They were just ordinary people,
barely getting by.

545
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,423
They waited by the roadside,

546
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:21,012
spotted a Grandeur, blocked it,
and kidnapped the passengers, right?

547
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,097
But, later,

548
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,686
it turned out
that the musician had purchased

549
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,938
the Grandeur as a used vehicle.

550
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,694
As for the small business owners,

551
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,449
they were kidnapped
after visiting their family graves

552
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,743
and held for ransom.

553
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,663
Do those people

554
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,875
belong to the wealthy class

555
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,253
they believe mistreated them?

556
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,882
I'm so sorry for what we did

557
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,718
to those people.

558
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,014
We went after Grandeur drivers,

559
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,893
only to find they were all good people
and small business owners.

560
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:14,023
People may face rejection,
anger, loss, and alienation,

561
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:19,737
but they don't turn to the kind of cruelty
the Chijon Family did.

562
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:24,825
Not everyone who lives an unhappy life
expresses their hatred in such a way.

563
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,372
One can offer
all the excuses and rhetoric,

564
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,207
but in the end, those men

565
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:36,629
still kidnapped, robbed,
and murdered for money.

566
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,966
Kim Gi-hwan,
the boss of the Chijon Family,

567
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,551
was indicted for raping
a teenage girl in August

568
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,762
and is now imprisoned in Gwangju.

569
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,641
Upon hearing the news
of the Chijon Family's arrest,

570
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,478
he said his boys had done a splendid job,
leaving the officers dumbfounded.

571
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,690
He said his boys made him proud

572
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,527
and that he was leaving this world
30 or 40 years early with pride.

573
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,410
Before that,
Kim Gi-hwan was charged with rape,

574
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,246
treated as a regular offender,
and held in gen pop.

575
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
LAW

576
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,376
He mentioned it as a correctional officer
took him outside.

577
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,712
He said he could just die 30 years early.

578
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,632
He was 27 or 28 years old at the time.

579
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,051
"I'd probably live to around 60 anyway."

580
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,679
"I don't mind leaving 30 years early.
It puts me at ease."

581
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,815
At first, Kim Gi-hwan flatly denied
conspiring to commit the crimes.

582
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,737
Later, as the investigation progressed,

583
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,072
he realized there was no way to avoid it.

584
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,744
So he admitted to the crimes,
said he was the leader,

585
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,038
that he planned everything,

586
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:56,167
and even claimed
the other members were innocent.

587
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,336
They said it over and over.

588
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,671
"We do whatever Chijon tells us to do."

589
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,134
"And that's why
we killed Song Bong-u as well."

590
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:10,056
"And as for what happened in Daejeon,
we were just following his orders."

591
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,270
There are differing opinions
on why Kim Gi-hwan ended up in prison.

592
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,733
Some say he ended up there
simply for committing rape.

593
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,529
Others believe
he intended to give the orders

594
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,323
but stay out of the crimes

595
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,410
so that if they were caught,
he'd face a lighter sentence.

596
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:36,749
He only raped and killed Ms. Choi
with his own hands at the beginning.

597
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,251
He didn't personally kill
any of the other victims.

598
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,214
So I believe
he deliberately went to prison

599
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,507
to avoid culpability.

600
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,134
It's possible with Kim Gi-hwan's brain.

601
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,136
It's a nice world we live in.

602
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,137
KIM GI-HWAN'S MOTHER

603
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,181
You can make a living driving a car.

604
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,017
I don't know
what would have made him do such a thing.

605
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,187
Had we known,
we wouldn't have let him do something

606
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,189
that led to his death.

607
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,984
He was a good student in school.
I don't know what happened.

608
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,406
Come on. Get in.

609
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,540
One last thing you want to say?

610
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,916
This world is fucking shit.

611
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,168
Hey, move.

612
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,556
Six members of the Chijon Family
were sentenced to death,

613
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,517
as expected
and demanded by the prosecution.

614
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,353
The court stated
that the inhuman acts of these men,

615
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,440
who abandoned their humanity
in both motive and method,

616
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,984
warranted the harshest punishment.

617
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,409
Hey! How am I guilty when Chun Doo-hwan
and Roh Tae-woo are innocent?

618
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,786
The laws in this country are fucked up!

619
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:11,177
"What right do you think you have
to pass judgment on us?"

620
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,636
PARK SANG-GU

621
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,055
"Did you provide us with a place to sleep
when we had none?"

622
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,348
OBSERVED CHIJON FAMILY TRIAL

623
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,268
"Or did you give us a job
when we had none?"

624
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,479
"Did you give us food
when we were starving?"

625
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,773
"What right do you have
to pass judgment on us?"

626
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,819
They hurled insults and abuse
at the judges.

627
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,073
When the judge asked
for his closing statement,

628
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,326
he'd just blame his art teacher.

629
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,536
That's not exactly repentance, is it?

630
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,165
"My teacher would beat me
if I didn't bring art supplies,

631
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:45,127
but the next time, when I stole them
and brought them, he didn't beat me."

632
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,254
DEFENDANT

633
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,298
"So what did I learn in school?"

634
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,926
"I learned to steal."

635
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,221
"I'm living my life
based on what my teacher taught me."

636
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,644
At first, he was posturing
about leaving this world 30 years early.

637
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,396
But then he blamed his teacher,

638
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,900
as if the shock had set him
on the wrong path,

639
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,945
which led him to where he was.

640
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:11,946
Hearing that,

641
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,908
I realized all the things he said before
were just posturing.

642
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:33,425
I got pretty close to them over the week
we spent in the detention center.

643
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,974
I guess they remembered
how kind I was to them.

644
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,478
They wrote me letters,
and Kang Dong-eun later even wrote,

645
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,855
"Detective Ko,

646
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,441
I'm letting go of everything now

647
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,652
and realizing the error of my ways."

648
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,823
BUT AFTER ACCEPTING JESUS AS MY SAVIOR,
I PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS OF MY SINS

649
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,075
PLEASE LET PEOPLE KNOW
WE ARE NO LONGER THE CHIJON FAMILY

650
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,286
"All of us are no longer the Chijon Family

651
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,371
but the Heaven Family."

652
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,956
WE'RE LIVING AS THE HEAVEN FAMILY

653
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,459
How do you feel about your mother?

654
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,671
My mother? I regret
not being able to kill her myself.

655
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,716
I asked him directly if he still regrets

656
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,302
not killing his mother
before going to prison.

657
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,347
He told me his father died
when he was in fifth grade.

658
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,267
If I remember correctly,
it was his father's friend.

659
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,478
He said his mother abandoned him
and his two siblings for that man.

660
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,772
He also said she betrayed his father.

661
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,816
And he said,

662
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,318
"Pastor."

663
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,362
"I loved my mother so much."

664
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,490
"I was so fond of her, Pastor."

665
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,410
And he cried.

666
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,663
There's something he used to say to me.

667
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,206
"Mom."

668
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,835
"Don't you even know
what your own son is up to?"

669
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:53,839
That's what he would say.
Now that I think about it,

670
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,259
he must've said that
because he was involved in these things.

671
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,722
I apologize to the people of this country

672
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,850
for all the cruel things my son did.

673
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,061
I don't know what to say.

674
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,400
A person killing another? It's horrific.

675
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,069
To think my own son did that.

676
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,500
I don't know what went wrong with my son.

677
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,004
I don't remember when,
but while sitting in the living room,

678
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:34,963
he said,

679
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,799
"If it weren't for my family,

680
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,635
I'd run away with you,

681
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,137
Hyo-jin."

682
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:46,308
I heard him say that to me twice.

683
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,935
"I want to run away,

684
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,937
but I can't."

685
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,273
"If I run away, my family will die."

686
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,653
Kim Hyeon-yang said that to me,
smiling as he looked at me.

687
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,950
He told me that on that day.

688
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,994
About the two of us running away.

689
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,872
Then he went on

690
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,043
to confess his feelings for me.

691
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,215
"Is it okay for me to love you?"

692
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,467
I think that's how he asked me.

693
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,638
When I didn't reply, he said, "I get it."

694
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:29,727
"It's ridiculous for someone like me
to even dare love you, Hyo-jin."

695
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,022
"In the outside world, you wouldn't even
look at someone like me twice."

696
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,524
At that moment,

697
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:41,864
I got the feeling
that he was already regretting it.

698
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,284
Regretting continuing
with what they were doing.

699
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:51,165
He said he wanted to run away with me
and live somewhere far away, if he could.

700
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,378
He hung his head as he said,
"But it's just a vain hope, isn't it?"

701
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,464
Even then,

702
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,301
I felt he had a change of heart.

703
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:06,096
I definitely felt that in both instances.

704
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,861
Ms. Lee Hyo-jin's feelings
toward Mr. Kim Hyeon-yang

705
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,406
seem to have been shaped by his words
and actions suggesting he might spare her.

706
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,408
KO NA-MU
FORMER REPORTER, CEO AT FACTSTORY

707
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,702
I think she kept that with her
for a long time.

708
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,831
He left his belongings with her
when he went to see the doctor,

709
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,042
which made no sense at all.

710
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,671
Ms. Lee Hyo-jin seemed to wonder

711
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:44,510
if Kim Hyeon-yang truly intended
or had the will to spare her life,

712
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:48,013
feeling psychologically conflicted
about it.

713
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,351
Even if he'd intended to let her live,

714
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:57,898
all the crimes he had committed beforehand

715
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,611
were truly heinous crimes in themselves,
beyond redemption.

716
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,573
I've come across
a number of articles and content

717
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,408
that interpret the relationship

718
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,495
between Ms. Lee Hyo-jin
and Mr. Kim Hyeon-yang

719
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,622
as if it were simply a romantic one.

720
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,208
I believe such an interpretation shows

721
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,254
a complete lack of understanding
of criminal psychology.

722
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,466
The death penalty for the Chijon Family,

723
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,969
who committed
horrific kidnappings and murders,

724
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,679
along with 19 violent criminals,

725
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:32,015
was carried out in detention centers
in Seoul and Busan.

726
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,354
The six Chijon Family members,
including Kim Gi-hwan and Kang Dong-eun,

727
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,440
whose brutal crimes made
national headlines last September,

728
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,442
were executed today.

729
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:58,000
The female survivor, calm and assertive
amidst the terrifying situation,

730
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,878
lulled her captors
and found a chance to escape.

731
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,465
The police said
Ms. Lee took part in some crimes,

732
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:09,303
but given that she was coerced
under threat of death,

733
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,388
they decided not to prosecute her.

734
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,684
Without psychiatric medication,

735
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,353
I can barely get through the day.

736
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,357
I take about 15 pills at once.

737
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,694
In the middle of the day, if I feel off,

738
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,280
I take about two more.

739
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,703
I had cancer in both breasts,
so I underwent a double mastectomy.

740
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,831
I also had a hysterectomy.

741
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,586
And I only have one ovary.

742
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,804
People usually meet friends,
grab coffee, go on trips, and eat out.

743
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,307
That's how life goes day-to-day, right?

744
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,977
I've hardly done any of those things
over the past 30 years.

745
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:05,067
To be honest, there's no one around me.
I don't have any friends.

746
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,193
I'm all alone.

747
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:17,913
In a way, I ended up killing everyone
just to survive on my own.

748
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,499
"I took part in all those actions."

749
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,503
That thought filled my mind,
and I blamed myself

750
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,589
for a long time after my escape.

751
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,385
So I even resorted to self-harm.

752
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:37,349
When I wanted to survive,
I did everything I could,

753
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,977
but I did nothing for the other victims.

754
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,853
That thought was hard to bear.

755
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,652
People say it's been 30 years

756
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:53,115
and that I should have moved on by now.

757
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,494
They can say that because
they haven't lived through what I did.

758
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:02,124
I'll probably be thinking about it
at my last breath.

759
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:11,258
THESE DAYS, I FEEL LUCKY
TO HAVE LIVED THIS LONG AFTER THE INCIDENT

760
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,930
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO, LIKE ME,
WERE VICTIMS AND NOW LIVE IN THE SHADOWS

761
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,100
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT YOUR LIFE HAS MEANING
JUST BY BEING ALIVE

762
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,313
EVEN PEOPLE LIKE ME GO ON LIKE THIS

763
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,613
LASTLY, MAY ALL THE VICTIMS
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES REST IN PEACE

764
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:37,784
LEE HYO-JIN
SURVIVOR OF THE CHIJON FAMILY CASE

765
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,503
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

766
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,757
SOME HAVE BEEN REENACTED BY ACTORS
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY

767
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:56,780
