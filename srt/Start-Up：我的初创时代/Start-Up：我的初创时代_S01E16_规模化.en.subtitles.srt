Excuse me.
I'm looking for Cheongmyeong Company.

00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,086
It's… May I ask who you are?

6
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,299
I'm Hwang Sang-hyeon,
a reporter from Hyungju Daily.

7
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,344
HYUNGJU DAILY
HWANG SANG-HYEON

8
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,179
Oh, you're a reporter?

9
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,139
Do you have an appointment?

10
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,726
You don't need that
to interview a start-up.

11
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:43,937
Where is it?

12
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,190
They're in the meeting room
on the second floor.

13
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,858
I see. How do I get there?

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,068
It's that way.

15
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,778
-Thanks.
-No problem.

16
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,049
Mr. Han, have you heard of
Hwang Sang-hyeon at Hyungju Daily?

17
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,677
I have, and I don't want anything
to do with him.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,930
-Why?
-His specialty is bashing start-ups.

19
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,183
He asks for shares
in return for writing favorable articles.

20
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,687
When a company turns him down,
he writes articles to make them look bad.

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,688
He's dirty.

22
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,439
Gosh. Really?

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,192
He's here to interview
Cheongmyeong Company.

24
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,986
Why? About what?

25
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,822
Beats me. He doesn't even seem
to have an appointment.

26
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,823
Any idea?

27
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,039
They're bidding soon.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,377
Their competitor might have
tipped him off about something.

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,296
Like what?

30
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,923
They haven't done anything
that could become…

31
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,759
-Ransomware.
-Ransomware.

32
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683

SEO DAL-MI

34
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,901
I asked around in the industry.
Everyone says Cheongmyeong Company

35
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,194
is the new dark horse.

36
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,616
Has the word already spread?

37
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,494
It sure has.
I also heard that you plan to participate

38
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,497
in the bidding for Seonju Smart City's
self-driving platform.

39
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,458
Yes, that's correct.

40
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,876
The number you have dialed…

41
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,299
The number…

00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,836
They're being so childish.

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,046
What is this?

46
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,592
Yong-san is trying to solve the anagram
to find the ransomware culprit.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,309
What is this?

48
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,645
Why?

49
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,086
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

50
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,879
-I said, no.
-Yes, you do.

51
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,798
-Guys, what's this?
-What?

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,968
Apollon and Artemis.
Where did these words come from?

53
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,680
The ransomware hostname
has been bothering me,

54
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,390
so I came up with some anagrams. Why?

55
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,436
I saw Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong's profiles
in our version control tool recently.

56
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,897
Shin Hyeon's username was Apollon,
and Shin Jeong's Artemis.

57
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,066
-What?
-Really?

58
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,193
Apollon? Artemis?

59
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,154
They're twins, right?

60
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,614
Is it just me or is something fishy?

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,241
Can this really be a coincidence?

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,744
If Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong were

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,954
behind the ransomware attack…

64
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,207
But why would they attack
the servers of their own company?

65
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,251
Exactly. What could've been in it
for them?

66
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,131
I just remembered something.

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,636
Right before the ransomware attack,
I saw the two

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,847
meeting with the director of Morning AI.

69
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,934
Then Morning AI talked them into attacking
their own company?

70
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,646
-Does that make sense?
-We'll find out.

71
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,107
Dal-mi, did you report the attack?

72
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,569
Of course, right away.
The police are probably looking into it.

73
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,702
The company I interviewed yesterday

74
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,621
dealt with a bad ransomware attack

75
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,664
and had to pay over 200 million won.

76
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,959
Really? We also had…

77
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,090
Oh, no. You guys dealt with one too?

78
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,636
Usually, all you lose is some money.

79
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,472
But in your case,
people's lives are on the line.

80
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,391
You're right. But we managed
to sort it out on that day.

81
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,602
We found the key
and restored all the files.

82
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,603
That's good.

83
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,817
But what if a similar problem
occurs again?

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,862
Don't you think there are potential risks?

85
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,741
You're right. So we've upgraded
our security to the highest level.

86
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,745
Our developers are experts in not only
image recognition but also security.

87
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,456
This guy right here can solve

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,999
any security problems.

89
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,836
I see.

90
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,296
I think I've got all I need now.

91
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,591
No.

92
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,053
The really important part starts now.

93
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,389
What?

94
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,773
Is Ms. Seo here, by any chance?

95
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,608
Yes. She's doing an interview.

96
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,318
It has to be stopped.

97
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,113
-That reporter is--
-Notorious, I know.

98
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,950
I've known him since Nature Morning.

99
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,537
He's known as the start-up sniper.
He's brought down so many of them.

100
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,247
And you're not stopping this?

101
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,042
No, I'm not
because they're handling it pretty well.

102
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,920
They're handling it well?

103
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,717
The important part starts now?

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,262
Absolutely. If we end the interview here,

105
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,599
it's pretty obvious what tone
your article will take, isn't it?

106
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,351
"Cheongmyeong Company

107
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,563
is bidding for the Seonju Smart City's
self-driving platform.

108
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,735
Self-driving cars that get hacked
can take people's lives.

109
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,740
Cheongmyeong Company
has recently been hacked."

110
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,658
Am I wrong?

111
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,248
Oh, my. I mean, it's a fact, isn't it?

112
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,333
Is there more?

113
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,128
Don't you want to know
something more important?

114
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,422
-Something more important?
-Yes.

115
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,717
Who was behind the attack?

116
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,428
Do you know who's behind it?

117
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,596
Of course.

118
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,099
By analyzing the event log,
we found the attacker.

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,366
When we performed a port scan
on the attacker's laptop,

120
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,661
the hostname matched
the PC name that was infected.

121
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,834
We submitted the evidence

122
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,796
to the police officers
investigating our case.

123
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,216
And the police just called and told us

124
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,510
-that the suspects had been arrested.
-Are you two Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong?

125
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,845
-Who are the suspects?
-Please come with us.

126
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,180
Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong.

127
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,891
They used to be our developers.

128
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:24,272
But right after the ransomware attack,
Morning AI recruited them as their CTOs.

129
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,611
They also met with Director Won Sang-su
right before the incident.

130
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,656
We submitted evidence of that
to the police, as well.

131
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,284
The investigation will reveal
who was behind all of this.

132
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,457
What will your article say about this?

133
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,126
I can't wait.

134
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,051
Goodness. Well, everything's
already been sorted out.

135
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,762
Our editor will probably kill the story.

136
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,849
The culprits have been caught,

137
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,893
and the son of Morning Group's chairman
was behind it.

138
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,729
How can you pass this up?

139
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,902
I'm not supposed to report
on crimes under investigation.

140
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,073
Other reporters seem to have
no problem doing that.

141
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,744
Will you report on the results, then?

142
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,370
Of course.

143
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,914
Once the investigation is over.

144
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,083
-I'll be going now.
-Bye.

145
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,460
-Goodbye.
-See you.

146
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,503
-Let's start the meeting.
-Okay.

147
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,090
Do write that article.

148
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,135
Or else everyone will suspect
you colluded with them.

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,522
That's a relief.

150
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,109
Did you run here?

151
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,488
-Sorry?
-Your ID card got turned around.

152
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,494
I was afraid she'd make a mistake again.

153
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,413
It's her third year already.

154
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,291
She's had her fair share of problems.

155
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,418
She can handle this much.

156
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,132
You're right.

157
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,094
Of course.

158
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,390
You seem to have mixed feelings about it.

159
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,476
I do?

160
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,146
Why would I? I'm just happy for her.

161
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,983
It's a weight off my shoulders.
I can finally relax.

162
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,986
I'll be going.

163
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,702
No,

164
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,287
he definitely looks disappointed.

165
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,475
What's with Mr. Han?

166
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,727
Is he okay?

167
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,443
I can't really tell.
But he's probably okay.

168
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
-Dong-cheon.
-Yes?

169
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,709
I'm leaving a little early today.

170
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,711
If something important happens, call me…

171
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,380
Text me if you can.

172
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,633
See you.

173
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,848
Isn't he too young for menopause?

174
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,810
-Enjoy. Bye.
-Thank you.

175
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,937
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

176
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,106
-It's 3,000 won.
-3,000 won.

177
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,110
CONGRATULATIONS ON OPENING

178
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,697
-Grandma, we're here.
-I'm here, too.

179
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,159
Who is it? Do-san?

180
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,660
Yes, it's Do-san.

181
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,996
Nice to see you. It's been a while.

182
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,415
I heard you'd come back from the US.

183
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,501
It's been so long.

184
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,211
It's been really long, Ms. Choi.

185
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,799
Has your eyesight gotten a lot worse?

186
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,887
Hey, you're looking at me with pity
in your eyes again, aren't you?

187
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,474
No, I'm not. You look great.

188
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,601
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

189
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,319
Do-san, you've been a great help.

190
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,616
Without NoonGil,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

191
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,159
It's a lifesaver.

192
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,917
That's right. NoonGil works so well
I can never slack off.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,878
As soon as I doze off, it tells her,
"She's dozing off."

194
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,338
It reports everything.

195
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,715
I know. It's incredible.

196
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,559
Thank you so much for developing NoonGil.

197
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,062
I don't know how to repay you.

198
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,524
I'm extremely lucky.

199
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,241
You deserve so much more.

200
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,584
Grandma, Do-san and NoonGil's engineers
are really close.

201
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,503
If you're unhappy with the app,
just tell Do-san.

202
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,132
If you tell me, I'll ask them
to update the app immediately.

203
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,508
Okay.

204
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,012
I'll write down my feedback
in a notebook like last time.

205
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,638
Yes, please.

206
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,516
Oh, right. Grandma,
Do-san knit a plant for you.

207
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,476
-What?
-He knit a plant? How?

208
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,981
The inspiration came from a cactus.

209
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,776
This also has a RGB theme,
just like the sponges I made for you.

210
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,405
R means "red,"

211
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,325
G means "green," and B means "blue."

212
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,868
There he goes again.

213
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,121
-Press here, and it'll talk.
-Here?

214
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
Yes. Press hard.

215
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,504
It'll be warm
if you hug this in the winter.

216
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,049
I tried to make it look like Dal-mi.

217
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,800
They look alike.

218
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,719
Grandma, this looks just like me.

219
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,805
A cactus that looks like Dal-mi.

220
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,794
Who is that?

221
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,755
Coming.

222
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,510
-Ms. Choi.
-Hey.

223
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,638
How did you get here?

224
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,640
My daughter-in-law gave me a ride.

225
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,557
I see.

226
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,935
Come this way.

227
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
Be careful.

228
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,535
Dal-mi said your place is amazing.

229
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,953
It's such a shame.

230
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,248
I should have been here
before my eyesight got bad.

231
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,293
Are you here to give me corn dogs?

232
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
Yes.

233
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,048
-Here.
-Oh, my.

234
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,221
I'm glad you came.
I actually have something to tell you.

235
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,515
You do? What is it?

236
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,103
-You've already opened a shop.
-Right.

237
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,772
But aren't the stairs in your house
a nuisance?

238
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,277
Why don't you move to an apartment?
I'll get one for you.

239
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,364
Hey, aren't you tired of talking
the same nonsense over and over?

240
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,950
Is there anything else you need?

241
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,243
I don't need anything.

242
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,123
If you feel so bad, do something nice
for someone worse off than me.

243
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,167
But you're the one I owe.

244
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,752
Then forget it.

245
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,338
If that's what you want to talk about,
I'm leaving. I'm tired of this.

246
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,633
Gosh. If you're sick of it,
just let me pay you back.

247
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,178
If I were you,
I'd have gotten it over with already.

248
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,890
"Gotten it over with"?

249
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,855
Good Boy, are you going somewhere?

250
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,025
Where would I go?

251
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,944
Ji-pyeong.

252
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,158
You said I shouldn't call you

253
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,911
if I'm doing well.

254
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm doing a bit too well these days.

255
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,208
I'm pretty busy.

256
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,920
I'll call you when I'm going through--

257
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,046
Don't do that.

258
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,182
Call me even if you're doing well.

259
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,392
Visit me often.

260
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,271
Come see me whether something

261
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,107
happens or not.

262
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,951
Why would I if nothing's happened?

263
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,702
Just come over.

264
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,998
Come over and talk nonsense.

265
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,417
I'm

266
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,880
almost deaf and blind now.

267
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,134
You can say and do anything
in front of me.

268
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,095
Laugh and cry all you want.

269
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,476
I won't ask why.

270
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,980
So come see me often.

271
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,403
You shouldn't get too used to being alone.

272
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,281
Don't…

273
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,873
become any lonelier, Ji-pyeong, okay?

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,967
Okay.

275
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,452
It's okay.

276
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,371
Don't cry.

277
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,586
I'm here for you.

278
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,312
I emailed everyone a list of the other
self-driving car companies.

279
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,813
-Okay.
-Okay.

280
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,901
SEONJU SMART CITY BIDDER LIST

281
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,238
I guess it's a large project.
There's quite a few bidders.

282
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,572
It's not just that.

283
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,534
Every decent self-driving car company
in the country seems to be bidding.

284
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,953
I know.

285
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,455
How are we going to beat them?

286
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,417
"Beat them"? Hold on, Ms. Seo.

287
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,381
Our goal isn't seriously
to win the bid, is it?

288
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,218
Aren't we just giving this a try
for the experience?

289
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,512
Of course. It's for the experience.

290
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,181
No pressure. No big deal.
We're just giving it a try.

291
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,183
What if we end up winning?

292
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,979
If we do, I'll give you a billion won.

293
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,732
-Are you sure?
-He means it's impossible.

294
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,443
If we win, I'll shave my head.

295
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,654
I'll reveal my boyfriend if we win.

296
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,409
Are you sure?

297
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,661
What I'm saying is that it's impossible.

298
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,997
Right?

299
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,041
Still, if we do win,

300
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,503
-keep your word.
-Sure.

301
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,672
You'll shave your head, right?

302
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,258
Of course. I'd do it hundreds of times.

303
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,969
What? Then let's all make a promise.

304
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,346
If we win, I'll buy you all a sports car.

305
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,890
Gosh, Mr. Han, you're so generous.

306
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,142
Mr. Nam, what about you?

307
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,810
If we win,

308
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:53,937
I'll propose.

309
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,367
Well, he means it's impossible.

310
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,412
Ms. Seo, how many finalists will be there?

311
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,247
Oh…

312
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,250
Well…

313
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,712
Five.

314
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,591
Five? All right, let's go have a meeting.

315
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,301
-Let's go.
-Okay.

316
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,392
HAN JI-PYEONG

317
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,441
Mr. Han, how are you feeling today?

318
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,525
Park Dong-cheon.

319
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,153
Explain this.

320
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:47,407
Wait, how did this end up here?
Who put it here?

321
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,368
It came by email, and I had
a good feeling about it.

322
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,247
Orphans struggle financially
once they leave the orphanage

323
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,250
since they're in between
adolescence and adulthood.

324
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,335
And?

325
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,670
This start-up pairs
each orphan with a sponsor

326
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,131
who will help them
stand on their own feet.

327
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,052
The CEO himself is from an orphanage,
so he's very passionate.

328
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,637
It's such a great cause.

329
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,140
But that's about it. They're doing
charity work without creating value.

330
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,352
No reason to spend our LP's
hard-earned money on them, right?

331
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,271
I know. I was just going to cancel
the meeting.

332
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,316
Don't. Meet with them.

333
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,442
What?

334
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,987
Really?

335
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,574
KO GIL-DONG PROJECT

336
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,138
Everyone, it's past 10 p.m.
Are you not leaving?

337
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,933
The demo simulation can't seem to catch

338
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,019
the red light at this intersection.
What should we do?

339
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,897
It has to catch it. No matter what.

340
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,359
-Try lowering the threshold.
-Okay.

341
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,864
Are you all staying?

342
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,615
It's not working.

343
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,200
Should we shoot a new video?

344
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,910
-Let's do that.
-At this hour?

345
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,996
You can go ahead. Don't worry about us.

346
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,209
-You want to shave your head?
-Yes, I really do.

347
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,816
I believe we should set ourselves
apart from the other bidders

348
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,068
by also focusing on monitoring the driver.

349
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,697
Using our facial recognition technology,
we can detect drowsy driving.

350
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,365
And lane departure as well.

351
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,332
We'll submit our proposal tomorrow,
so review it thoroughly.

352
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,794
Driving environment recognition
is nothing special.

353
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,965
We need to differentiate ourselves
to stand out.

354
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,387
Should the decision-making part
come first? Or second?

355
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,890
-Dal-mi.
-Yes?

356
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,935
How far do you think Tarzan can go?

357
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,145
Tarzan?

358
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,482
Our goal is level five.

359
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,986
But there are more factors than just us.

360
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,698
Law, the road environment…
We need the whole infrastructure in place.

361
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,865
Not like that.

362
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,915
Why? If I tell you my goal,
can you make it happen?

363
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:24,958
Sure.

364
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,879
What I want Tarzan to do is…

365
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,882
Like in the movies,

366
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:37,262
I want it to be able to navigate
on its own and even fly.

367
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,139
What?

368
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,348
I'm just joking.

369
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,727
Not like that.

370
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,692
My father

371
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,987
passed away in a car accident.

372
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,034
And my grandma is almost blind now.

373
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,710
I hope Tarzan will make sure that
no one passes away like my father did

374
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,797
and that my grandma can move around
without worrying.

375
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,049
Can you make that happen?

376
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,971
Yes, I can make it happen
within five and a half years.

377
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,266
If we scale up properly and invest in R&D,

378
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,642
within three years.

379
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,646
Do you think we'll win the bid?

380
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,939
Of course.

381
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,110
You said we should give it a try
just for the experience.

382
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,446
I changed my mind.

383
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,408
We're not just giving it a try.
It's not just for the experience.

384
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,245
I'll make it happen.

385
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,963
Not delivering what you promise
makes you a fraud.

386
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,800
I will deliver it. At all costs.

387
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,410
I didn't mean to interrupt.

388
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,621
I kept trying to make sounds,

389
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,915
but you didn't seem to notice.

390
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,126
Lost in your own world.

391
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,740
What?

392
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,658
I lost to you.

393
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,994
I'm so jealous.

394
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,080
What do you mean?

395
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,094
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Han.

396
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,137
Good morning.

397
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,810
Mr. Han, Mr. Hong is here.

398
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,812
Mr. Hong? Who's that?

399
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,149
He's the CEO of the start-up
that helps orphans financially.

400
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,525
You remember it, right?

401
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,404
-Is he in the meeting room?
-Yes.

402
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,129
Hello, I'm Han Ji-pyeong.

403
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,592
Hello, I'm Hong Ji-seok.

404
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,182
Nice to meet you.

405
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,392
Please have a seat.

406
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,651
This is the first time
an investment company has contacted me.

407
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,529
I didn't know this day would come.

408
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,114
Try to calm down.

409
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,658
Okay.

410
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,829
You must be busy.
I'll try to keep it short.

411
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,334
Here you go.

412
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,712
You know the cartoon character,

413
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,633
Ko Gil-dong, who took in
Dooly, Ddochi, and Douner, right?

414
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,927
We find kind grown-ups like Ko Gil-dong

415
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,389
and pair them with teenagers
who just left the orphanage

416
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,683
and need to stand on their own feet.

417
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,103
Is there anything else you need?

418
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,813
I don't need anything.

419
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:01,067
If you feel so bad, do something nice
for someone worse off than me.

420
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,028
When you leave the orphanage,
you're not really a child or an adult.

421
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,614
They're separated from society
by tall walls.

422
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,951
Our solution will help them
overcome the walls--

423
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:14,455
Mr. Hong, I've already read through
your business plan and done my research.

424
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,167
Have you thought about your company value?

425
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,256
I'm afraid
I haven't really looked into it.

426
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,133
What should I do?

427
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,180
How much money are you trying to raise?

428
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,310
My goal is 100 million won.

429
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,479
I don't think my company
will be able to invest in your company.

430
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,565
How about 50 million won?

431
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,444
But I'd like to invest personally.

432
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,571
DIRECTOR HAN JI-PYEONG

433
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,619
Personally? Why?

434
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,705
I like your voice.

435
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,708
My voice?

436
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,837
I'll invest 100 million and donate
300 million. I don't need many shares.

437
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,591
I just want you to find me
some nice kids who need my help.

438
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,843
What do you say?

439
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,808
I'll send you a term sheet next week.

440
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,894
Well…

441
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,480
Thank you so much.

442
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,566
I really appreciate it.

443
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,194
No. I should thank you.

444
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,237
Bless you.

445
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,708
Unbelievable.

446
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,593
How was it?

447
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,346
Definitely your type of company.

448
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,098
What does that mean?

449
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,559
Full of hopes and dreams
but no growth strategy.

450
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,270
All it has is a great cause.

451
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,441
I'm sorry. I wasted your time again.

452
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,027
You did a good job.

453
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,278
Pardon?

454
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,990
What?

455
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,367
-What did you just say?
-Nothing.

456
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,829
You did. I heard it.
You said I did a good job.

457
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,914
-I didn't.
-You did.

458
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,874
You said I did a good job.

459
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,668
-I didn't.
-Did anyone hear it?

460
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,336
He said I did a good job, right?

461
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,464
You heard it…
I mean, you said it, didn't you?

462
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,217
-Go away.
-Fine.

463
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,886
I did a good job?

464
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,930
Did you hear that?

465
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,474
Get back to work.

466
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,155
I hope I didn't forget anything.

467
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,033
I have the proposal here,

468
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,413
the flash drive here…

469
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,541
When is the deadline again? 3 p.m.?

470
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,460
Yes, we have two hours left.

471
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,544
That's plenty of time.

472
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,339
Do you think Morning AI will bid, too?

473
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,927
I'm not sure. Their key employees
are being investigated by the police.

474
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,137
They probably won't.

475
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,432
-I guess you're right.
-Yes.

476
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,859
Oh, they are bidding, too.

477
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,236
Yes, we are.

478
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,032
What's with the look on your faces?

479
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,534
You're being investigated by the police.

480
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,828
And you're still bidding?

481
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,456
Oh, the investigation?

482
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,792
We'll probably pay a little fine.

483
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,877
It was just an attempt.

484
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,129
Exactly.

485
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,507
What does that have to do with this?

486
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,344
Nothing, I guess.

487
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:02,016
Everyone and their dog can
submit a proposal, anyway.

488
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,102
Everybody and their dog?

489
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,146
Are you serious?

490
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,112
Let's go.

491
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,206
Don't let them bother you.
They're not worth it.

492
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,500
You've changed.

493
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,213
-What do you mean?
-Do you remember what you first said

494
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,339
about those guys?

495
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,009
Well, I'm not sure.

496
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,803
They're twins.

497
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,097
They're top-notch AI developers.

498
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,516
-Top-notch?
-They've been global since college.

499
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,642
They went to MIT.

500
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,520
-I said that?
-Yes.

501
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,438
I have changed.

502
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,279
Did Ms. Seo submit the proposal
without trouble?

503
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,615
Yes. She said the place was so crowded.

504
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,201
But who cares?
We're doing it for the experience.

505
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,330
You're right. There's no way we'll win.

506
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,750
Are new people coming in?

507
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,421
It seems so. Did you write one of those?

508
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,214
I did.

509
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,180
Where was it?

510
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,564
There it is.

511
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,484
I WANT TO MEET A GUY BETTER THAN ME

512
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,613
That's very ambitious.

513
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,616
-"Ambitious"?
-Yes, definitely.

514
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,035
Is there any guy in this world
better than you?

515
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,287
Maybe you're right.

516
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,373
I only became more competent,
looking for such a guy.

517
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,751
I couldn't find anyone in the legal world

518
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,669
or in the design world.

519
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,755
I was hoping to find someone here,

520
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,342
but then I got tangled up with the crook,
and here I am.

521
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,844
I see.

522
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,892
-My sister must be here.
-Your sister?

523
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,811
Do you want to come? Have lunch with us.

524
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,443
No, I'm fine. I'll eat here.
Have a good time.

525
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,071
All right.

526
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,620
Now I know why she doesn't introduce me
to anyone as her boyfriend.

527
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,956
I'd be ashamed, too.

528
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,250
There you are.

529
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,503
Meet my sister.

530
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,422
Hi.

531
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,175
Oh, hi.

532
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,136
I'm Ms. Jung's colleague.

533
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,806
We work together. I'm Lee Chul-san.

534
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,308
I see. Nice to meet you.

535
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,560
He's my boyfriend.

536
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,775
Sa-ha talks about you all the time.

537
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,485
I recognized you right away.

538
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,157
Thank you. I mean…

539
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,286
Gosh. This is such an honor.

540
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,419
Really?

541
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,428
When will it be announced?

542
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,430
At 2 p.m. Two minutes left.

543
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,434
Stop pressing the function key.

544
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,978
If we pass this screening,
we're a finalist, right?

545
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,480
-There will be five, right?
-Yes.

546
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,649
It's not going to happen.

547
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,904
Exactly. It was just
for the experience after all.

548
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,074
Don't get your hopes up.

549
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,412
My goal isn't winning the bid.
All I want is to become a finalist.

550
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,706
What?

551
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,583
-What?
-What?

552
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,917
-Did we pass?
-Did we pass?

553
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,878
-No way.
-We passed?

554
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,547
YOU PASSED THE 2ND SCREENING

555
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,109
This,

556
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,613
this, and this, please.

557
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,199
-This one with berries…
-Okay.

558
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,786
It's the best.
Make sure you target this first.

559
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,412
-Got it?
-Got it.

560
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,630
Dig in! It's my treat.

561
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,215
Thank you.

562
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,926
The cakes look fantastic.

563
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,101
Mr. Lee, try this. It's really good.

564
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,316
Let's celebrate.

565
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,446
Do-san, are you okay?

566
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,615
Let me help you with it.

567
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,827
What if something crazy happens?

568
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,203
No way.

569
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,415
Let's be grateful
that we're one of the five finalists.

570
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,376
No. I want something
really crazy to happen.

571
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,504
You said you'd give me a billion won
if we win.

572
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,923
I'll make it happen
no matter what it takes.

573
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,635
Good. You get sports cars ready then.

574
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,389
Mr. Kim, get a billion won ready
in advance.

575
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,600
Mr. Lee, you'll have to shave your head.

576
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,811
I know. I had a hair clipper ready.

577
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,396
Put this on.

578
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,732
Ms. Jung, keep your word.

579
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,820
Don't worry. I never go back on my word.

580
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,197
Do-san, you, too.

581
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,534
Don't worry. I'll do it.

582
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,499
Yes, I can make it happen
within five and a half years.

583
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,253
If we scale up properly
and invest in R&D, within three years.

584
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,849
On that note, I'd like to ask

585
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,893
your opinion on something.

586
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,734
Almost every self-driving car company
in the country made a bid,

587
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,653
and we became a finalist.

588
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,282
I believe it's proof that
our technology has a competitive edge.

589
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,325
I think so.

590
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:40,331
So I'm wondering
if it's time for us to scale up.

591
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,001
You want to expand our business?

592
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,170
Yes. I want to speed things up.

593
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,340
I want to recruit more people
and invest in R&D.

594
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,925
What do you guys think?

595
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,566
You want to start a funding round?

596
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,362
Yes, we became a finalist
in the bidding competition.

597
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,573
It's proof that our self-driving system
has a competitive edge.

598
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:19,078
And you believe it's time
to find investors and scale up.

599
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,996
-Exactly.
-I'm against it.

600
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,042
A company that gets investments
without revenue isn't valued high.

601
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,504
-You'll only lose control.
-It's to generate more revenue.

602
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:32,299
-Wait until your numbers look better.
-No, it'll be too late then.

603
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,427
Right now, speed means more than control.

604
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,555
We haven't had any outside investors yet.

605
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,141
No, and that was so we wouldn't
lose control in a situation like this.

606
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,394
-In-jae.
-End of discussion.

607
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,605
You did a great job.
Win the bid by all means.

608
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,375
Wait, please.

609
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,053
Are you getting in?

610
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,654
You're not avoiding me anymore?

611
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,949
Turns out, I'm more resilient
than I thought.

612
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,702
So you have something to tell me?

613
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,081
-Yes.
-Go ahead. I'm listening.

614
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,918
But don't say thank you or sorry.

615
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,545
I already know.

616
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,257
But I have to.

617
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,930
You've thanked me
more than enough times so far.

618
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,807
You owe me nothing.

619
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,814
Besides, I had no friends back then.

620
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,442
So your letters were my only comfort.

621
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,030
Let's say we're even.

622
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,324
Okay?

623
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,202
Okay.

624
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,581
Even after reading your letters,

625
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,459
I didn't look for you for 15 years.

626
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,004
Mr. Nam, on the other hand,

627
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,590
went to you the day he read them.

628
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,178
So I'm not the Nam Do-san

629
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,681
from the letters.

630
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,770
There's no reason you should feel sorry
or blame yourself.

631
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,526
You really want a clean break, don't you?

632
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,779
Are we okay now?

633
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,239
Yes.

634
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,682
Hey, have you heard?

635
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,563
Won Du-jeong's son had Cheongmyeong
Company's developers hack their company.

636
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,481
Yes, I heard that.

637
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,985
Why would such a big company do that?

638
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,531
They're determined to trample
on any potential competitors.

639
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,368
The son is now being investigated
by the police.

640
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,828
Jeez, is that true?

641
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:53,125
I doubt that this lecture is
worth listening to.

642
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,627
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

643
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,422
-That's so mean.
-I know.

644
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,424
-Unbelievable.
-Is the lecture still on?

645
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,134
-I think so.
-It's ridiculous.

646
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,969
-So shameless.
-Why is he even lecturing?

647
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,387
-Who knew?
-Let's go.

648
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,849
This lecture was going to be
a Q and A session,

649
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,351
but not many turned up.

650
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,771
We're all busy.
So let's not waste each other's time

651
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,565
and wrap it up here.

652
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,650
I have a question for you.

653
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,365
Yes, go ahead.

654
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,913
HR is key, you say.

655
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,832
And what you did to me was
also related to HR.

656
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,709
Why did you kick me out back then?

657
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,463
I didn't know
personal questions were allowed.

658
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,382
There aren't many people here.
Just answer her question.

659
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,800
Is that okay with everyone?

660
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,677
Yes, go ahead.

661
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,892
I thought if I kicked you out,
you'd become more obedient and come back.

662
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,895
I guess I was never very obedient.

663
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,983
Your obedient son seems to be
quite busy these days.

664
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,152
Being investigated and losing the bid…

665
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,987
-In-jae, you…
-By the way,

666
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,990
my name isn't Won In-jae anymore.
It's Seo In-jae.

667
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,952
The decision arrived today.

668
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,873
Thank you for the great lessons
you've taught me so far.

669
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,108
Wait, Ms. Seo.

670
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,779
Yes? What is it?

671
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,863
Well…

672
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,741
I need to apologize for something.

673
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,536
-To me?
-Yes.

674
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,498
At the relay lecture three years ago,

675
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,834
I asked you this question.

676
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,588
Many say your success is
only thanks to your rich father

677
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,549
and doesn't count
because you didn't start at Sand Box.

678
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,842
Any thoughts?

679
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,302
Do you remember that?

680
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,596
Yes, I do.

681
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,807
That was you?

682
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,309
Yes.

683
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:19,896
What? I've been working with someone
who insulted me all this time?

684
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,106
How generous I am.

685
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,485
I didn't even know you well.
I was out of line.

686
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,696
I'm sorry.

687
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,951
But come to think of it, without your
insult, I wouldn't be where I am now.

688
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,703
What do you mean?

689
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,331
It made me angry,
but it also motivated me.

690
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,628
I can't thank you, but I'll at least
accept your apology. Okay?

691
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,838
Okay.

692
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,265
DO-SAN

693
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,517
Do-san, what's up?

694
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,395
Really?

695
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,731
I could've sworn I packed it.

696
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,399
Where is it?

697
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,611
Gosh, I can never get used to the stairs?

698
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,073
Who are you?

699
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,783
We used to work here.

700
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,953
We're the founders of Samsan Tech.
We work at Cheongmyeong Company now.

701
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,330
Samsan Tech?

702
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,916
You launched your business here, right?

703
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,877
-That's right. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

704
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,337
Nice to meet you guys.

705
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,923
Are you moving in here?

706
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,093
Yes, we started our business recently.

707
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,887
May I ask what this place is like?

708
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,308
It's nice. The rent is cheap, and…

709
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,313
the view is just fantastic.

710
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,857
When you're hungry, open the window.

711
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,943
You'll get a whiff of rib-eye steaks.

712
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,362
But it's steaming hot in the summer.

713
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,780
Get an air conditioner first.

714
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,573
We'll find investors before summer.

715
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,158
-Absolutely!
-We will.

716
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,911
-We can do this!
-Yes, we can!

717
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,789
I'm sorry, but is it okay if we take
one last look around?

718
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,625
Oh, sure. Take your time.

719
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,460
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

720
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,506
Call me when you need help.

721
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,427
-Thank you.
-You, too.

722
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,763
Awesome.

723
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,891
-This looks fancy.
-I can't believe this.

724
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,818
So new people are moving in here.

725
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,946
We can't come in here anymore.

726
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,907
Gosh.

727
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,830
Hey, are you crying?

728
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,750
No, I'm not.

729
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,379
-You are.
-I just feel sorry for those guys.

730
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,841
To think that they'll be slaving away
in this moldy rooftop office…

731
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,927
I feel so sorry.

732
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:00,098
You're right. I certainly don't envy them.

733
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,100
My gosh.

734
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,778
What have you been doing all this time?

735
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,071
If I were Yong-san or Chul-san,

736
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,742
I'd ask you to compensate me
for the past two years of my life.

737
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,167
I'm sorry, guys.

738
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,169
For everything.

739
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,297
-What?
-What are you talking about?

740
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,632
It's just…

741
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,761
If I'd been a more competent CEO,

742
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,264
you would've escaped this place sooner.

743
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,893
I was lost for years.

744
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,021
I made you worry

745
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,734
and put you through so much.

746
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,447
I'm very ashamed.

747
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,035
That's bullshit.

748
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,913
If I was after money,
I would've cut you off.

749
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,415
We didn't

750
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,502
quit our well-paying jobs and join you
to become rich.

751
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,213
Then why did you?

752
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,925
Why do you think I just cried?

753
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,887
-You felt sorry for the guys.
-Gosh, you're so clueless.

754
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,808
I miss the old days.

755
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,105
The scorching summers
we spent together here…

756
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,441
I loved them.

757
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,319
I miss them.

758
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,283
Otherwise,

759
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,120
why would we have shown up
to this horrible place every morning?

760
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,665
Gosh, do we really have to say
these cheesy things?

761
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,377
How would I know if you didn't tell me?

762
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,559
Come here.

763
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,186
We had a great time.

764
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,732
-Thank you.
-Then be good to us.

765
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,401
-I'll be good to you.
-I'll be good to you, too.

766
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,111
I'll be better.

767
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:19,946
Why did you have to start crying?

768
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,448
You guys did great.

769
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,118
Don't cry.

770
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,078
Stop it.

771
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,371
You cried first.

772
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,750
-I love you guys!
-Damn it.

773
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,775
Are you leaving?

774
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,863
Good luck

775
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,616
with your business.

776
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,827
-You can do this!
-We'll root for you.

777
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,621
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

778
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,795
Wait, where did the Samsan Tech sign go?

779
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,716
A man came and took it earlier.

780
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,469
Someone took it.

781
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,892
Who?

782
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,604
SAMSAN TECH

783
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,315
Why did you put that up there?

784
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:38,900
Take it off.

785
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,569
Isn't it nice and bright?

786
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,658
You were really mean to Do-san
when he was running Samsan Tech.

787
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,038
That's why I put this up.

788
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,582
If Do-san does something
unreasonable again,

789
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,460
I'll look at this sign three times

790
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,714
and ride it out.

791
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,384
If that's your intention,

792
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,513
I'm with you.

793
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,482
SAMSAN TECH

794
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,543
It's a credit card,
so she has to receive it herself.

795
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,045
Is Ms. Seo Dal-mi not home?

796
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,422
No, she isn't.

797
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,549
You can sign for her.

798
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,386
But I can't see well.

799
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,930
-I see.
-Where should I sign?

800
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,058
Let's see. Right here.

801
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,351
I'll do it.

802
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,938
-Who are you?
-I'm Seo Dal-mi's sister.

803
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,357
Okay. Just a second, please.

804
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:03,902
Here.

805
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,449
SEO IN-JAE

806
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,496
All right. Here you go.

807
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,706
It's all done. Bye.

808
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,293
Is it…

809
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,633
Is it really you, In-jae?

810
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,304
Yes, it's me, Grandma.

811
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,018
I'm sorry it took me so long.

812
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,323
In-jae.

813
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,180
Did you cry?

814
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:16,057
No.

815
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,227
You look like a panda.

816
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,604
Your mascara is smudged everywhere.

817
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,899
It smudges easily
since it's not water-proof.

818
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,943
What a lame excuse.

819
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,320
Stop it.

820
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,781
We haven't seen each other in forever.
Don't fight.

821
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,535
I've been asking you to come over,
but you said no every time.

822
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,454
What's gotten into you?

823
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,085
I came to show you this.

824
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,255
What is it?

825
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,930
You…

826
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,392
What's wrong?

827
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,480
Yeong-sil, open NoonGil.

828
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,231
Sure, one second.

829
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,900
Yeong-sil, read this.

830
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,737
"The applicant is allowed
to change her last name to Seo

831
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,990
and return to being a member
of the Dalseong Seo clan."

832
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,499
My name is not Won In-jae anymore.
It's Seo In-jae, Grandma.

833
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,133
In-jae.

834
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,054
I wanted to come here sooner.

835
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,350
But I was so ashamed
when my last name was Won.

836
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,734
You could've just come.
Who cares about that?

837
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,488
You should've come
while Grandma still could see you.

838
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,242
I can see you.

839
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,162
I can see you all

840
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,958
very clearly.

841
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,642
Mother, I'm home!

842
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,186
Guys, I picked up fried chicken!

843
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,313
-Hi, Dad.
-Yes! Fried chicken!

844
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,108
-That looks amazing.
-Did you get soda?

845
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,110
-I did.
-What about gizzards?

846
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,528
Oh, I forgot.

847
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:36,030
-But Mother loves gizzards.
-My bad.

848
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,202
Dig in.

849
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,871
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

850
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,583
Thank you!

851
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,003
Mother!

852
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,089
Come have some chicken!

853
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,550
-Grandma, hurry up!
-Mother, come!

854
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,343
Grandma, come eat with us!

855
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,054
-The drumsticks are mine.
-Go ahead.

856
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,322
SEO IN-JAE

857
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:00,948
This is…

858
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,338
Who said you could go through my desk?

859
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,216
Did you fix this?

860
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,219
No, it fixed itself.

861
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,764
It's mine. I'm taking it.

862
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,974
Whatever.

863
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,029
I have something to give you.

864
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,495
Do you remember our bet?

865
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,288
I'll be honest.

866
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,624
At the moment,
I'm not as successful as In-jae is.

867
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,460
I admit it.
But In-jae is three years older than me.

868
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,170
So give me three years.

869
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,799
I'll outdo her by then.
Let's bet 10,000 won.

870
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,343
-What do you think?
-Sure. 10,000 won, it is.

871
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,886
I do remember that.

872
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,973
But what does this mean?

873
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,100
Do you think I've outdone you?

874
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,977
Not yet.

875
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,688
But you will if you scale up your company.

876
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,608
What? But you said no.

877
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,694
Do it.

878
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,492
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

879
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,579
I don't want you to become obedient.

880
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,958
What does that mean?

881
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,254
Are you saying you like me
when I'm hot-tempered and rebellious?

882
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,714
Something like that.

883
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,107
Cheongmyeong Company is looking

884
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,942
for investors?

885
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,613
Yes. Ms. Seo wants to scale up
the company.

886
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,699
She must've realized a few things
during the bidding competition.

887
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,702
I also believe it's about time.

888
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:14,248
Please recommend investors that are
interested in self-driving systems.

889
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,168
I can't do that.

890
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,506
Why? Do you think it's still too early?

891
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,217
That's not it.

892
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:29,222
I wouldn't hand over
this great opportunity to other investors.

893
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,811
I've been interested in them
since they were Samsan Tech.

894
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,896
I believe they've grown enough

895
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,357
for us to consider investing in them.

896
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:41,567
In addition,

897
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,200
you two were the beginning of this place.

898
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:50,993
I'd like to support you.

899
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,621
Thank you so much.

900
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,707
-Let's proceed right away.
-Okay.

901
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,961
Who should I send the information to?

902
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,259
I'm not doing it.

903
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:13,224
Why not? Who else here knows
Cheongmyeong Company better than you?

904
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,478
Dong-cheon. Mr. Park knows them well, too.

905
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,105
Mr. Park.

906
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,024
Park Dong-cheon.

907
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,361
-Dong-cheon.
-Yes, Mr. Han.

908
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,116
-What's the matter?
-I know you heard me.

909
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,618
No, I didn't.
I was so focused on the document.

910
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,456
What do you think?
Mr. Park has been interested in them

911
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,376
-since the Samsan Tech days--
-No, not really.

912
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,421
I was never nearly as interested
in them as you were.

913
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,797
I'm no match for you.

914
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,009
Well…

915
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:49,927
I agree with him.

916
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,680
I believe Cheongmyeong Company has

917
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,974
a bigger potential
than they think themselves.

918
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,393
I'm sure they'll enter a J curve soon.

919
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,188
If we can see it,
other investors will see it, too.

920
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,108
You know we can't lose this deal
to anyone.

921
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,444
Get it done.

922
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,782
Ms. Yoon. Wait! Ms. Yoon!

923
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,869
You can do this!

924
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,667
What's so funny?

925
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,226
Should I beg him to accept my investment?
This is driving me crazy.

926
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,562
Why me?

927
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,902
Why did you want to see me in private?

928
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,951
I have a favor to ask.

929
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:56,911
A favor?

930
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,538
You have a favor to ask me?

931
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,418
-Ms. Yoon wants to…
-What?

932
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,840
Ms. Yoon wants to invest
in Cheongmyeong Company.

933
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,509
Would you accept it?

934
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,056
Why are you telling me this in private?

935
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,059
-Come to our office and--
-I was told to do this,

936
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,603
but I don't want anything to do with you.
That's why.

937
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,774
I know how much you didn't want
my investment.

938
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:29,944
You're right.

939
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,737
I hated it.

940
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,411
All right. I made an offer just now,

941
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,205
but you firmly rejected it again.

942
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,207
All right?

943
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,002
Mr. Han.

944
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,840
What's your honest opinion
on this investment?

945
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,720
Put your emotions aside.

946
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,180
I want your rational judgment.

947
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,187
Do you remember my second record?

948
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,106
I do.

949
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,983
Among the companies

950
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,487
that you decided not to invest in,
zero succeeded.

951
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,531
Right?

952
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:20,828
If I pass up Cheongmyeong Company,
I'll lose my second record.

953
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,499
Honestly, as an investor,

954
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,754
this is an opportunity
I really don't want to miss.

955
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:36,802
Come with me.

956
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:41,849
Let's go discuss the investment
with Ms. Seo properly.

957
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:48,481
Mr. Nam, are you accepting my investment?

958
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,192
If you do,
I'll keep meddling in your business

959
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:54,028
as an outside director.

960
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,197
Aren't you tired of my nagging?

961
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,866
-I am.
-So why?

962
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,288
Why are you accepting my investment now?

963
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:08,042
Because this time,
it doesn't sound like charity

964
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,961
but a real investment.

965
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:33,776
Thank you.

966
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,405
I should thank you.

967
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,953
This is awkward.

968
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:51,794
Let's go.

969
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,276
Dal-mi, I'm an atheist.

970
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,029
I'm not very faithful, either.

971
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,782
Then why?

972
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,580
Because our final presentation
for the bidding is tomorrow.

973
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,916
I'm praying that we'll win.

974
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,794
Speaking from experience,
this actually works.

975
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,563
Did you pray?

976
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,398
Well, yes.

977
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,193
I can't seem to calm down
even after praying.

978
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,444
I'm so nervous.

979
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,739
Look, a rainbow.

980
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,824
Hey, let's pray.

981
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,705
-Again?
-This church is pretty effective,

982
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:13,584
but now there's a rainbow, too.
Gosh, this is totally going to work.

983
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,254
Come on, pray.

984
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,675
A rainbow doesn't make
your wish come true.

985
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,136
It's just light reflecting and refracting.

986
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,058
You don't believe it?
So you're not going to pray?

987
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:33,437
I mean, there's no objective evidence
that a rainbow makes your wish come true.

988
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,232
Evidence, you say?

989
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,860
Fine, here's the evidence.
Okay, I'll show you.

990
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,958
See? I prayed to the rainbow
that I'd kiss you.

991
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,292
And it worked.

992
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,878
This is different.

993
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:01,674
You're the one who kissed me.
The rainbow has nothing to do with it.

994
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,717
Same difference.

995
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,180
Pray first.

996
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,393
And then make it happen.

997
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,022
Got it.

998
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,125
What are you praying? That we win the bid?

999
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,584
No.

1000
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,671
Something more feasible.

1001
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,215
More feasible? Like what?

1002
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,051
That our company becomes a unicorn.

1003
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,344
UNICORN: PRIVATE START-UP
WORTH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

1004
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:50,389
Hey, that's even harder.

1005
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,809
That would take really long.

1006
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,978
You're not saying it's impossible.

1007
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,734
Nothing's impossible. We can do anything.

1008
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:09,885
Hello, everyone.

1009
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:13,305
I'm Seo Dal-mi,
CEO of Cheongmyeong Company.

1010
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,372
I WANT TO TAKE THE UPPER-FLOOR ELEVATOR

1011
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:39,957
No, I can't lose to her!

1012
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,708
Then it'll look like

1013
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,920
I lost to her because I chose Dad.

1014
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:46,547
I want to pretend I'm successful

1015
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,258
and I don't envy her. Just for one day.

1016
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:05,315
I hope Tarzan will make sure that
no one passes away like my father did

1017
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,652
and that my grandma can move around
without worrying.

1018
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,420
I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD

1019
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:45,022
So I'm following in your footsteps.

1020
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,524
-My footsteps?
-I'm going to start a company,

1021
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,568
like you did.

1022
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,216
Let's go.

1023
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,521
I WANT A BETTER FUTURE

1024
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,855
I WANT TO GO MY OWN WAY

1025
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,277
I WANT TO HELP OTHERS

1026
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,113
I WANT TO MAKE MY PARENTS PROUD

1027
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:40,661
I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD

1028
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,588
SPECIAL THANKS TO YEO JIN-GOO

1029
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,418

Where's Dal-mi…

1036
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,342
I mean, where are Ms. Seo and Mr. Nam?

1037
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,803
It's the annual
shareholders' meeting today.

1038
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:17,646
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING START-UP
