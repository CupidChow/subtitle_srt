EPISODE 10

2
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,535
Who are you, really?

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,163
I hoped…

4
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,624
And who is Do-san?

5
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,877
…she would notice me…

6
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,758
Mr. Han, please…

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,678
Say something!

8
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,223
…and look at me one day.

9
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,732
Hey.

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,194
Do-san.

11
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,658
Do you remember the place where
we used to leave our letters 15 years?

12
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,037
Where is it?

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,546
Answer my question. Please.

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,923
But not with those eyes.

15
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,092
Why can't you answer my question?

16
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,303
And why is Mr. Han here, not you?

17
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,308
Regrets always come too late.

18
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,081
I want you to explain to me.

19
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,250
Be honest.

20
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,128
No more lies.

21
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,590
I don't want to be fooled anymore.

22
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,887
Who wrote the letters

23
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,307
15 years ago?

24
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
Was it Do-san

25
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,479
or you?

26
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,568
Your grandma asked me for a favor.

27
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,363
She wanted to give you a friend.

28
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,366
So I wrote the letters.

29
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,496
It was a lie from the beginning.

30
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,584
Then what about Do-san's name?

31
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,377
Why did you use his name?

32
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,213
It didn't mean anything.

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,966
I just happened to see the name

34
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,886
in a newspaper article.

35
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,514
Just a name in an article?

36
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,774
So he was a complete stranger.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,446
Then how did Do-san show up
at the networking party?

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,033
If what you're saying is true,
he must not have known me.

39
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,117
So how?

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,536
I found him.

41
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,082
Nam Do-san from the article.

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,379
And I asked him
to be the Nam Do-san from the letters

43
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,007
and attend the party.

44
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,761
Then why…

45
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,891
did Do-san go along with that?

46
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,102
I was a stranger to him.

47
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,689
Back then, Samsan Tech was

48
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
in need of investments.

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,491
So he did it for money.

50
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,867
No, that's not true.

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,289
It may have been at first,
but his feelings about you became real.

52
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,874
-I also--
-How do you know that?

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,753
It was all a lie from the beginning.
How am I supposed to believe that?

54
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,678
Ms. Seo, I…

55
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,406
TEXT NECK

56
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,120
Are you with Dal-mi? Where are you?

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,876
Okay.

58
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,086
Okay.

59
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,547
Are you okay?

60
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,885
Don't worry.
I'll see you when you get back.

61
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,596
Bye.

62
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,850
-Was that Do-san?
-Yes.

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,686
A bug occurred in the end.

64
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,645
A bug?

65
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,566
-Did Ms. Seo find out everything?
-Yes.

66
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,029
Didn't I tell you
that we should remove the bug first?

67
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,950
What if our company has to close down?

68
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
Close down? Why?

69
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,917
Ms. Jung, I didn't say anything.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,002
-Should I rotate it?
-The other way.

71
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,921
What did Ms. Seo find out?

72
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,340
I didn't say anything.
Hey, did you say something?

73
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,050
No, I didn't.

74
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,553
Tell me. Right now!

75
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,848
It's all over now.

76
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,310
Start-ups should forbid romance
within the company.

77
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,316
"Forbid"? It's not a crime
to have feelings for someone.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,154
He's right. It's not strange
for a guy and a girl to develop feelings

79
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,489
for each other--

80
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,282
That should not happen.

81
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,452
We're five people. Imagine two of us
date and then break up.

82
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,829
How awkward would that be?

83
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,498
"Ex-girlfriend, here's the portfolio."

84
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,209
"Ex-boyfriend,
are you done with the coding?"

85
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,669
Kill me now.

86
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,588
Maybe they won't break up.

87
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,215
Right.

88
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,592
You never know.

89
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,094
Just think about it.

90
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,763
It turned out that the letters were
from another guy.

91
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,682
And Han Ji-pyeong, of all people.

92
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,476
He's rich, well-educated,
and good-looking.

93
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,603
Who wouldn't be swayed?

94
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,480
Han Ji-pyeong versus Nam Do-san?

95
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,898
Han Ji-pyeong wins, for sure.

96
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,068
There's no question about it.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,488
I mean, I don't think Do-san
is that lacking compared to Mr. Han.

98
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,158
He's not just lacking. He's very lacking.

99
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,286
Do-san has something
that Mr. Han doesn't--

100
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,203
No.

101
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,165
-Gosh.
-This is annoying.

102
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,500
Wealth, education, connections…
In every aspect.

103
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,046
Does that really matter?
What's important when you like someone?

104
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,339
Your feelings are.

105
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,425
They sure are important.

106
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,385
But now her feelings are split

107
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
between her first love
and the person she likes now.

108
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,308
If she likes the two equally,

109
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,060
how do you know which one is true love?

110
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:01,814
This is annoying.

111
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,953
Dad, I got a love letter.

112
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,413
Isn't his handwriting amazing?

113
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,499
He's my age. His name is Nam Do-san.

114
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,792
Isn't that such a special name?

115
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,048
Take this.

116
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,634
My business card.

117
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,760
SAMSAN TECH

118
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,386
SAMSAN TECH, NAM DO-SAN

119
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,517
So I'm following in your footsteps.

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,353
I'm going to start a company,
like you did.

121
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,272
We…

122
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,567
got in.

123
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,821
-For real?
-Yes, for real.

124
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,743
Well, we'll just get lost.

125
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,539
"Sail off without a map." Remember?

126
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,010
Dal-mi, stop crying.

127
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,764
Please, stop crying.

128
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,196
It was just for one day.

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,617
I just wanted to make your dream
come true for one day, and stop.

130
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,701
But…

131
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,585
That one day felt so nice
that I missed my chance to stop.

132
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,180
I kept putting it off until tomorrow
and ended up

133
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,893
wanting to go on as long as I could.

134
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,564
Dal-mi, I'm sorry, so please…

135
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,441
You're not supposed to say sorry.

136
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,945
You're supposed to say I'm mistaken.

137
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,366
Say that you're the Do-san I knew.

138
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,495
Why are you saying you're sorry?

139
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,791
That means this was all a lie.

140
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,837
That means all of this was fake.

141
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,898
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,778
Was it fun?

143
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,701
Watching me get excited

144
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,123
over those fake letters like an idiot,

145
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,045
then announce I'd start a company like you

146
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,925
when I was obviously in over my head?

147
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,390
Was it fun?

148
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,228
It was painful.

149
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,567
When you looked at me…

150
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,112
When you smiled at me…

151
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,199
When you encouraged me…

152
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,705
Knowing that I didn't fully deserve it
tore me apart.

153
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,624
I…

154
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,963
I wanted to be the person you wanted.

155
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,635
But I couldn't,
and it was just so hard to bear.

156
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,643
The person I want?

157
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,067
I don't know who that is.

158
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,070
Yes, Dal-mi got home safe.

159
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,322
She went to bed right away.

160
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,994
No. She said she was tired,
so I didn't ask her anything.

161
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,875
Don't worry. She's fine. She will be.

162
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,337
Okay. Good night.

163
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,461
AN EVENT WHERE START-UPS DEMONSTRATE

164
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,964
THEIR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS MODELS
TO INVESTORS

165
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,146
What are you doing?

166
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,441
When your eyesight worsens,
these things can be dangerous.

167
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,153
Should you be worrying
about my eyesight now?

168
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,447
Yes, I should be.

169
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,202
Do you know what torments me the most?

170
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,831
I can't understand
what's going on around me,

171
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,208
and it pains me to see you.

172
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,878
But I still have to work.

173
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,590
I have to prepare for Demo Day
and have to make

174
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,426
NoonGil work.

175
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,471
I have to keep working

176
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,100
with you and Mr. Han
as if nothing happened.

177
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,981
Sadly, I'm not that big of a person.

178
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,027
That's why I look like a mess.

179
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,863
Okay.

180
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,243
Let's not meet outside work
for the time being.

181
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,677
UNITE AND FIGHT

182
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,887
STOP MOU WITH INJAE COMPANY

183
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,893
Please make sure
you mention that often in your article.

184
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,562
-We say no!
-We say no!

185
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,906
Hello, Mr. Oh Yeon-ho.

186
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,910
You… How dare you show up here?

187
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,747
Wait, you even brought reporters?

188
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,332
Can we talk for a minute?

189
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,084
We have nothing to talk about.

190
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,628
Why don't you go talk
to our manager instead?

191
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,631
Fine, where is he?

192
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,886
Mr. Nam, this woman is here
to take the bread out of our mouths!

193
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,430
She even brought reporters.

194
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,642
Who is here?

195
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,860
Hello, I'm Won In-jae,
CEO of Injae Company.

196
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,655
I'm Nam Seong-hwan.

197
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,116
-I don't like the way she looks.
-That witch.

198
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,325
That young thing is the CEO?

199
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,495
-She fired us all!
-How can such a brat run a company?

200
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,457
-How dare you show up here?
-We don't want you here!

201
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,793
-Go back!
-You're the one who fired us!

202
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,336
Silence!

203
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,427
You brought all these reporters.

204
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,012
Welcome.

205
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,599
I ask you all to report
everything we say today

206
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,518
in an impartial manner.

207
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,979
A fair report!

208
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,856
-Hear, hear!
-An impartial report!

209
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,110
I'd like to attend the meeting between you
and Haun Engineering and Construction.

210
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,863
Suit yourself.

211
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,911
Are you the ones who developed
the damn manpower reduction model?

212
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,288
It's called the manpower efficiency model.

213
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,583
There's no difference.
Its goal is to fire people.

214
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,717
-Sand Box?
-Yes, that's where we're located.

215
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,512
Isn't that where his son entered recently?

216
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,766
Really? I entered there
recently myself, too.

217
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,894
-What's your son's name?
-That's none of your business.

218
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,856
MANAGER NAM SEONG-HWAN

219
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,902
Let's go.

220
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,029
-Let's go!
-We must stand our ground!

221
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,698
-We'll fight to the end!
-Keep fighting!

222
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,373
Is your son Nam Do-san
of Samsan Tech, by any chance?

223
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,085
Why do you want to know that?

224
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,505
I just find it interesting.

225
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:01,093
Samsan Tech developed a solution
to fire people, too.

226
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,804
And here you are, protesting against it.

227
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,018
Does your son know about your fight?

228
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,150
The elevator's here.

229
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:18,860
Okay.

230
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,988
Going up.

231
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,160
-Are you okay?
-Mr. Nam!

232
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,917
Don't air this on TV. It can't be on TV!

233
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,086
Pardon?

234
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,092
-Mr. Nam!
-Carry him on your back.

235
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,760
Hurry up!

236
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,470
What's with him?

237
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,850
-Be careful.
-This way.

238
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,270
-What happened?
-Put him down carefully.

239
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,730
My gosh.

240
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,066
He collapsed, all of a sudden.

241
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,987
That rude CEO got his blood pressure up.

242
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,072
Why didn't you take him to the hospital?

243
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,409
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

244
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,455
You're not fine. You're strong enough
to climb Mount Jiri, and you collapsed.

245
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,082
We'll take you to the hospital
immediately…

246
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,880
Maybe that's…

247
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,923
unnecessary.

248
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,634
It's absolutely unnecessary.

249
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,597
You guys get back.

250
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,642
What? We can't leave you here like this.

251
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,895
I want at least you to be there.

252
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,648
And don't tell anyone
that I collapsed, okay?

253
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,361
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

254
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,988
Still…

255
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:46,990
All right.

256
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,619
Please take good care of him.

257
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,079
I will, don't worry.

258
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,914
-See you later.
-See you.

259
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,041
-Let's go.
-Take care.

260
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,251
-See you.
-Bye.

261
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,921
-You don't have to see us out.
-No, I should.

262
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,555
What's going on?
Why did you put on a show like that?

263
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,265
My goodness.

264
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,392
There's a problem, honey.

265
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,230
I might end up ruining Do-san's future.

266
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,190
What?

267
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,629
What are you doing?

268
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,590
Aren't you feeling great today?

269
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,093
With a crow cawing and everything.

270
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,849
In Korea, it means that a long-awaited
guest will visit you, right?

271
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,104
That's a magpie.

272
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,023
A crow cawing is believed
to mean bad luck.

273
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,902
I think both are absurd, anyway.

274
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,488
Do you have a minute?

275
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,991
I have something to tell you.

276
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,252
Let's see… Mr. Park.

277
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,464
We should hold an orientation session
for CEOs before Demo Day.

278
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,883
I've put up a notice.

279
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,801
Oh, right. Ms. Yoon.

280
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,014
-Something's been bothering me.
-What is it?

281
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,559
Do you remember the CEO
who killed himself a few years back?

282
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,270
Was it the CEO of Charging Partner
in the second program?

283
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:43,899
What about him?

284
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,611
It seems like his younger brother
got into the 12th program.

285
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,363
-Who is it?
-Here.

286
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,450
I found out
while sorting through documents.

287
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,119
He's the deceased CEO's brother, right?

288
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,831
I don't know the details
because I wasn't here.

289
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,958
Do you know why he killed himself?

290
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,795
I heard that it happened
right after Demo Day.

291
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,840
As you know,

292
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,136
since the event may lead
to actual investments,

293
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,889
investors tend to ask harsh questions
at Demo Day.

294
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,849
They sure do.

295
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,394
I usually get exhausted
just from hearing the questions.

296
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,940
Imagine how the CEOs must feel.
They have to fight through it.

297
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:32,072
Back then, Charging Partner was
going through a lot, as it was,

298
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,701
and the CEO wasn't strong enough
to fight through it.

299
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,038
I wonder why his brother entered here.

300
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,416
I'd never go near a place
where a member of my family died.

301
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,597
"Revenge"? What? That's scary.

302
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,934
I WANT TO GET MY REVENGE

303
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,728
His family may have gotten the wrong idea

304
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,523
that he died because of someone here.

305
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,239
Silicon Valley?

306
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,785
You mean the Silicon Valley
in San Francisco?

307
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,538
Yes, and that's where
the 2STO headquarters are.

308
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,250
I'd like to hire you as an engineer
for our headquarters.

309
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,467
The compensation will be
the best in the industry.

310
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,637
300 million a year, plus stock
worth 1.5 billion over four years.

311
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,764
What do you say?

312
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,934
Well, I'm not sure.

313
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,314
Mr. Nam. We're 2STO.

314
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,065
And we're Samsan Tech.

315
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,652
Hey.

316
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,907
Work experience at the 2STO headquarters
can change your company's future.

317
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,577
Investors will line up with money.

318
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,746
They'll want to invest in whatever you do.

319
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,957
Let's say you write a book
about your experience at 2STO.

320
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,127
What's it called? Royalties.
You'll be able to live off royalties.

321
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,756
I'm not interested in writing
a book. I'm a terrible writer.

322
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,716
That's not the point.

323
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,387
Are you pushing me away
because you think I'm like Chairman Won?

324
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,098
He and I are very different people.

325
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,809
I'm not trying to exploit you.

326
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,227
I know that.

327
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,521
I still don't want to.

328
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,694
Fine. How about this?

329
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,032
You go back to Samsan Tech
after three years.

330
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,241
What do you say?

331
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,286
It'll give Samsan Tech wings.

332
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,332
-I'm running late.
-Have you no ambition?

333
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,249
No dreams?

334
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,710
I have dreams, of course.

335
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,380
I'll make your dreams come true.

336
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,141
I'll make you successful.

337
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,602
Does my dream have to be success?

338
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,148
Can't it be a person?

339
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,194
What?

340
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,863
A person?

341
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,200
A person? Who?

342
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,047
What should we do?

343
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,640
I can do this. I have to do this.

344
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,060
I have to.

345
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,448
-Good morning.
-Hi.

346
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,450
Good morning.

347
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,035
-I'm sorry I didn't come back yesterday.
-Not a problem.

348
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,496
As a token of my apology,
I'll buy everyone coffee.

349
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,877
That sounds great.
I'll have an iced Americano.

350
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,630
-I'll have an iced vanilla latte.
-I'll have that too. It's the best.

351
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,217
One iced Americano
and two iced vanilla lattes.

352
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,135
Yes.

353
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,389
Is she okay?

354
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,307
I think so.

355
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:41,529
Well… I'm getting everyone coffee.
An iced Americano for you, right?

356
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,032
Yes.

357
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,496
It does look awkward,
but it's probably not over.

358
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,580
No, it's not over.

359
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,749
It is over. Isn't that obvious?

360
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,044
-No, it isn't over.
-It isn't.

361
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,796
It's okay.

362
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,219
Good morning.

363
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,306
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

364
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,852
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

365
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,605
How is she? Is she okay?

366
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,942
She cried a lot, so I'm quite worried.

367
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,904
She's not okay.

368
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:29,077
Seeing Dal-mi's face this morning,
I realized what I've done.

369
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:35,416
I thought I started it
to make her laugh more,

370
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,255
but I was wrong. I was just being selfish.

371
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,428
They say white lies are harmless,

372
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,807
but that's also a lie.

373
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,527
There's no such thing as a harmless lie.

374
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,321
It always ends up hurting someone.

375
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,036
Light reflection at dusk
or a backlit object

376
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,706
can cause false negatives
and false positives.

377
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,334
When light reflection occurs,
why don't we apply LBP preprocessing?

378
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,921
We could also perform a deep
learning-based object detection task.

379
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
LBP?

380
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,551
But LBP is for differentiating textures.

381
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,595
How about we apply R-CNN?

382
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,263
We could build a data set.

383
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,724
-It'd involves various lighting.
-R-CNN?

384
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,436
It might also be a good idea
to perform data augmentation

385
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,522
through optical transformation.

386
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,608
-All right.
-Let's do that.

387
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,484
That sounds good.

388
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:05,214
-Ms. Seo, where are you?
-We're going to lunch soon.

389
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,221
I'm meeting someone for lunch.
Go without me.

390
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,827
Miss, I'm sorry,

391
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,539
but if you're by yourself,
can you sit with those people over there?

392
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,959
The place gets full during lunchtime.

393
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,210
Oh, okay.

394
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,128
I'm with her.

395
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,090
Oh, I see. Then two bowls of bibim guksu?

396
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,466
Yes, please.

397
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,470
Please hear me out.

398
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,808
I know you feel uncomfortable,
but I have something to tell you.

399
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,358
What is it?

400
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,530
The other day, you told me to be honest.

401
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,618
There are other things
that you don't know.

402
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,871
Is there more?

403
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,041
Mr. Nam Do-san and I are

404
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,711
not that close.

405
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,171
To be honest, I don't really like him.

406
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,092
I see.

407
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,053
But I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

408
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,266
He didn't do everything
because I asked him to.

409
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,061
Going to the networking party,

410
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,397
giving you his business card,

411
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,068
and asking you to be the CEO at Sand Box…

412
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,904
He did all that because he wanted to.

413
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,578
-Two bowls of bibim guksu, right?
-Yes. Thank you.

414
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,381
Well… I'd like to ask you something.

415
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,883
What is it?

416
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,427
Do you really go to Gapyeong every week

417
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,056
to have pine nut kalguksu?

418
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,771
No. I'd never even tried it
before you brought me some.

419
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,735
I shouldn't have been so nosy.

420
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,032
You weren't nosy.

421
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,413
I like you.

422
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,129
I didn't know I'd say this
while mixing noodles.

423
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,596
I have feelings for you,

424
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,224
Ms. Seo.

425
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,775
I'm telling you this to be honest,
not to make you uncomfortable.

426
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,070
It's just how I feel.

427
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,074
I don't expect an answer,
so don't let it bother you.

428
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,829
I don't want us to end up
avoiding each other because of this.

429
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,540
That'd be pathetic.

430
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,167
Dig in before the noodles get soggy.

431
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,177
Oh, the pine nut kalguksu that you got me…

432
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,179
It was really delicious.

433
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,988
Okay. See you.

434
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,785
-Do-san's not coming?
-He doesn't have much of an appetite.

435
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,456
I really didn't want to say this.

436
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,876
-But isn't it strange?
-What do you mean?

437
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,004
To be blunt, what did Do-san do so wrong?

438
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,632
He's been lying for Ms. Seo's sake.
And it made her happy.

439
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,134
I don't understand it, either.

440
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,303
How could she not understand
how Do-san feels?

441
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,014
Exactly. She's so clueless.

442
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,892
If I were Do-san, I'd feel really hurt.

443
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,145
Right.

444
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,065
It hurts so much when someone
doesn't understand how you feel.

445
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,986
I know exactly how that feels.

446
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,073
You do? By any chance,

447
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,576
do you have a crush on someone?

448
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,037
See?

449
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,455
You still don't get it.

450
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,462
Wait. Me?

451
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,963
Chul-san?

452
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,718
Oh, I'm sorry.

453
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,763
-What?
-Is this a dream?

454
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,765
Is this really happening?

455
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,436
How can I be so slow?

456
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,815
Ms. Jung, I'm sorry. Did I make you sad?

457
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,484
Hey, I got goosebumps.

458
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,696
Ms. Jung, then…

459
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,033
is this our first day together?

460
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,077
Is it?

461
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,578
No.

462
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,666
No?

463
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,126
I was lying.

464
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,172
Right? I knew it.

465
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,009
Ms. Jung, you made a fool of me.

466
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,221
What are you talking about?
I was lying for your own good.

467
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,141
Didn't it make you happy?
This is exactly what Mr. Nam did.

468
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,400
Gosh, I get it now.

469
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,902
What Do-san did is definitely wrong.

470
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,780
You're right. I get it, too.

471
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,866
Ms. Jung, you're brilliant.

472
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,618
Is this fun?

473
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,080
Just eat your freaking bread.

474
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,170
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

475
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,011
Hey.

476
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,265
Hey! Who are you?

477
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,936
Why are you making it hard for me
to find part-timers?

478
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,563
Let me see your face.

479
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:40,985
Mother.

480
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,741
Hey. What is this?

481
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,660
Are you still holding a grudge against me?

482
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,496
No, that's absurd.

483
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,582
I'm ashamed of what I did.

484
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,585
Then why are you sabotaging my business?

485
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,962
You're saying one thing and doing another!

486
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,631
No, it's not like that, Mother.

487
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,468
What?

488
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,969
Can I…

489
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,931
Can I work part-time for you?

490
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,934
Work part-time?

491
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,103
Oh, my.

492
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,652
I mean… Unbelievable.

493
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,450
So you're saying

494
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,703
you ran away from home
and have been sleeping on the streets?

495
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,999
I didn't exactly run away from home.
I just left home.

496
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,668
And I haven't slept on the streets.

497
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,089
I've been eating and sleeping

498
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,132
at internet cafes and saunas.

499
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,719
Now that you have nowhere to go,
you want to live off me?

500
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,555
I'm not going to live off you.

501
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,266
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

502
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,436
You need someone to help you,
and I need money.

503
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,147
We can help each other.

504
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,902
That's the approach I'd like to suggest.

505
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,029
I don't want to.

506
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,739
I'm your mother-in-law, after all.

507
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,033
No, I'm your ex-mother-in-law.

508
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:15,621
How about we go one step further
and you employ me?

509
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:20,876
I'm not so forgiving a person
that I can be nice to you.

510
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,630
You remind me of my poor son,
and it tears me apart.

511
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,676
So I think it's best
if we remain strangers to each other.

512
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,774
Ms. Seo, are you not getting off?

513
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,403
You guys go ahead.
I have to prepare my Demo Day pitch.

514
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,073
-We'll help you.
-No, please go ahead.

515
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,534
I'm meeting a friend later, too.

516
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,537
A friend? Who?

517
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,956
Just a friend of mine.

518
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,794
-Okay, see you.
-See you.

519
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,099
Do you think that "friend" of hers
might be Mr. Han?

520
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,559
No way.

521
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,814
It is him.

522
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,277
What should we do?
Our goalie's received a yellow card.

523
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,447
What else?
This is where the full-backs come in.

524
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,744
What is this? What are you doing?

525
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,787
Ms. Seo is super busy right now.

526
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,873
You can talk to us instead.

527
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,459
I'm not here to see Ms. Seo.

528
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,216
I'm here to see Mr. Nam.

529
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,480
Has NoonGil generated any revenue
in the past three months?

530
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,275
Business is all about numbers.
Tell me about your profit model.

531
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,402
What's your core technology?
Is it patented?

532
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,905
Tell me your estimated BEP
and financing plan.

533
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,658
How big is your target market?
Isn't it too small?

534
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,159
What's your strongest weapon?

535
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,412
WHAT'S YOUR STRONGEST WEAPON?

536
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,084
-Did you get everything down?
-Yes.

537
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:28,879
What are they?

538
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,882
The questions Ms. Seo might be asked
at Demo Day.

539
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,677
Only, they'll be even sharper.

540
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,096
Tell them you have no competitors,
and they'll ask

541
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,973
if your business is really needed.

542
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,810
Tell them you do, they'll grill you about
your patent status and entry barriers.

543
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,271
No matter how you answer,
you'll be attacked.

544
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,984
Prepare thoroughly
so that Ms. Seo doesn't get hurt.

545
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,865
I'm not sure if you should be
giving me advice in this situation.

546
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,121
I wanted to act like a brother
one last time.

547
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,290
"One last time"?

548
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,876
I told Ms. Seo
that I have feelings for her.

549
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,298
So I can't be a brother to you anymore.

550
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,175
I won't give you advice
or lend you things.

551
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,553
Cars, clothes, watches…

552
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,054
I don't need them.

553
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,848
And my past.

554
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,893
I don't need that, either.

555
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,314
To be honest, I'm not sure.

556
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,711
To be honest, I'm not sure.

557
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,342
Which will mean more to Ms. Seo,

558
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,555
Nam Do-san without the present
or Nam Do-san without the past?

559
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,749
CLAW MACHINE ROOM

560
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,206
One bottle of soju
and pork cartilage, please.

561
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,249
Coming right up.

562
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,356
Who are you?

563
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,444
I sat down because I felt like
I shouldn't leave you alone.

564
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,403
I'm by myself, too.

565
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,198
Is that okay?

566
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,868
Well, yes.

567
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,000
My, that is really difficult.

568
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:40,047
You thought there was one person,
but there turn out to be two?

569
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,551
You must be so confused.

570
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,349
Which of the two is

571
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,436
the Do-san I liked?

572
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,857
The one who wrote me letters 15 years ago

573
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,485
or the one I'm with now?

574
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,240
I really don't know.

575
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,202
I'm awful, right?

576
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:13,163
You're not. The ones who lied to you are.

577
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,709
It's okay.
It's only natural that you're confused.

578
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,378
Don't feel bad about it.

579
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,006
The worst part is

580
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,468
that I can't trust myself anymore.

581
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,645
I feel like

582
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,940
I'm walking a tightrope these days.

583
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,945
My job is to pitch
an unprofitable business.

584
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,699
But I'm losing my confidence.

585
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,492
That's not good.

586
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,412
You can't persuade someone
without being sure of yourself.

587
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,499
Now that everything's fake,
I feel like I'm a fake, too.

588
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,336
Because I'm confused,
the tightrope starts shaking.

589
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,423
I could fall any minute.

590
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,595
What should I do?
A CEO shouldn't be this way.

591
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,224
Are you a CEO?

592
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,646
What's the point?

593
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,774
I don't deserve to be.

594
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,654
I'm starting to doubt everything.

595
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,782
No, Dad. She's a lot more qualified
for the CEO title than I am.

596
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,909
I'm really a nobody, Dad.

597
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,369
I'm a good-for-nothing bluffing

598
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,912
about starting a business. I'm sorry.

599
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,665
What?

600
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,045
A good-for-nothing has been acting
like a genius. I'm sorry, Dad.

601
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm not sure if I can do this.

602
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,187
The longer you remain unsure,

603
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,898
the less confident you'll feel.

604
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,941
Make up your mind no matter how hard it is

605
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,693
so that you can overcome it.

606
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,071
You can do this.

607
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,408
How?

608
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,371
Ask for help.

609
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,081
Ask who?

610
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,541
Your ancestors.

611
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,379
My ancestors?

612
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,924
Hold a memorial service for your ancestors

613
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,842
and ask them for help.

614
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,969
It'll bring your fortune back.

615
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,640
-Really?
-Really.

616
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,726
Hold on. How can you be so sure?

617
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,271
Wait, what are you doing here?

618
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,691
Is he your friend?

619
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,489
This is bad.
You need help from your ancestors, too.

620
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,574
Hold a huge memorial service.

621
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,494
I want to know
what led you to that conclusion.

622
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,620
My personal experience.

623
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,915
I used to have text neck just like you.

624
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,127
But after I held a memorial service
and prayed to my ancestors…

625
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,046
Look. Do you see this perfectly normal
C-shaped curve?

626
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,966
But that can happen
without a memorial service.

627
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,218
It happened
after I held a memorial service.

628
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,595
I'm recommending this
based on actual data.

629
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,724
A memorial service is not superstition.
It's science.

630
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,855
Data means nothing
unless the other variables

631
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,481
were completely controlled.

632
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,317
What are the experimental
and control groups?

633
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,446
You don't know? You didn't compare them?

634
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,072
That renders your data useless.

635
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,659
Have you performed
a randomized controlled clinical trial?

636
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,911
No?

637
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,250
Who is this guy?

638
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,544
Nam Do-san.

639
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,317
You could have told me.

640
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,527
Why suffer alone?

641
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,783
Am I suffering? Why?

642
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,953
You probably don't remember
because you're drunk.

643
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,081
But you said

644
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,378
that you feel like everything's fake.

645
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,672
That you're losing confidence.

646
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,758
Really?

647
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,803
Without confidence, I'm nothing.

648
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,973
Yes, you're nothing now.

649
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,561
So how can we get your confidence back?

650
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,317
Should I tell you?

651
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,405
-Put me down.
-Okay.

652
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,961
Can you show up like that time again?

653
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,171
What?

654
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,967
You know, like at the networking party.

655
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,346
You erased

656
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,059
the most miserable period of my life.

657
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,907
That day,

658
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,743
you were my trophy,

659
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,079
my pride,

660
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,708
my comfort,

661
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,753
my wings…

662
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,053
You were my dream.

663
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,478
Show up like that day again.

664
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:17,652
It'll give me back my confidence,
and I'll be myself again.

665
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,534
You won't remember this when you sober up.

666
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,952
I'm not drunk.

667
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,332
Okay.

668
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,626
You're not.

669
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,883
Wait right here. Don't go anywhere.

670
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,763
I'll be right back.

671
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,893
Yong-san! Chul-san!

672
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,154
Will there be a match?

673
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,406
What the hell?

674
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,827
I'm sorry.

675
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:25,071
Excuse me. Did you see a girl
sitting on that red swing?

676
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,992
A girl with a ponytail,
holding that backpack.

677
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,662
Oh, her? She dozed off a little,
sobered up, and left.

678
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,457
Thank you.

679
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:04,110
Man, this won't end well.

680
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,780
It's no different from telling us
to close down.

681
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,990
This counts as bullying.

682
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,869
Even when you buy a carton of milk, you
check the expiration date and ingredients.

683
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,623
With hundreds of millions of won at stake,
this is the least they can do.

684
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,584
We'll be there when you give the pitch.

685
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,961
We can answer the technical questions.

686
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,256
Okay.

687
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,930
You want to keep that suit longer?

688
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,724
Yes, I want to wear it to Demo Day.

689
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,767
Why?

690
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,936
To show Ms. Seo?

691
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,105
I couldn't show her yesterday.

692
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,940
Why not? What happened?

693
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:43,983
I was too late.

694
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,986
By the time I got there,
she'd sobered up and left.

695
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,154
She doesn't remember?

696
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,282
No. She doesn't remember a thing
when she sobers up.

697
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,369
So you want to show her at Demo Day?

698
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,329
Yes.

699
00:56:57,038 --> 00:57:00,959
She says she is losing confidence
and feels like she's walking a tightrope.

700
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,712
I want to do something for her,

701
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,677
and all I can do is show up in that suit.

702
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,472
A suit that I borrowed.

703
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,142
Gosh, that's so touching.

704
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,102
All right.

705
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,270
Mr. Nam.

706
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:21,980
Yes?

707
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,986
Is your father doing okay? I'm worried.

708
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,404
He is.

709
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,990
Why are you asking about his father
out of the blue?

710
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,118
-I knew it was all a show.
-What?

711
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,954
Tell us what this is about.

712
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,165
What was all a show?

713
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:44,586
I would tell you what this is about,
but that wouldn't be fair to your father.

714
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,007
He probably hasn't told you because
he doesn't want to get in your way.

715
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,719
So I'm not sure if I should tell you.

716
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,345
Obviously you want to.

717
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,432
So tell me.

718
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,112
-Is it this way?
-Yes.

719
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,204
Let's go.

720
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:27,378
Honey, it's me. My colleagues
are coming to our house to visit me.

721
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,881
Tell them I'm sick in bed
and send them away.

722
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,342
No, you can't.

723
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,346
If I take part in the protest,
how could I face Do-san?

724
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,347
Why not?

725
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,015
Why…

726
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,861
You should go, Dad.

727
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,571
Go out there and fight.

728
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,825
Forget it.
I don't even have the energy to.

729
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,955
Do you think you'll be getting in the way
of my future if you fight?

730
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,259
Dad.

731
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,558
You're not my pride.

732
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,436
Are you ashamed of me?

733
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,772
And I don't want to be your pride.

734
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,113
It's very tiring to live
as someone's pride and joy.

735
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,783
You're afraid of disappointing the person,

736
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,119
so you pretend
you're strong and competent.

737
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,165
Let's not be each other's pride and joy.

738
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,127
Let's just…

739
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,007
be father and son.

740
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,189
TO QUESTION BOMBER

741
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,275
How is the preparation for Demo Day going?

742
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,114
If you need any help, feel free to…

743
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,497
How are you? I'm worried.

744
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,932
Dong-cheon, what's that T-shirt?

745
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,434
Gosh, you startled me.

746
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,563
I'm doing an orientation session
regarding Demo Day

747
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,939
for the CEOs later.

748
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,982
Really?

749
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,193
Take off that T-shirt, will you?

750
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,944
What? Why?

751
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,031
-Just do as I say.
-Why?

752
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:07,163
Wasn't the orientation session supposed
to be conducted by Mr. Park?

753
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:11,334
He has some business to attend to outside,
so I had to take over.

754
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:23,221
Let's go in.

755
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,976
What's with him?

756
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,357
At Demo Day, you present

757
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,944
the results of your hard work
to the whole world.

758
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,571
After giving a short pitch on stage,

759
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,699
you'll answer the judges' questions.

760
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,412
I see broadcasting equipment.
Will the event be broadcast?

761
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,456
Yes, the entire event
will be broadcast live

762
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:56,295
for the investors not only in the country
but around the world to watch.

763
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,718
What happens to the companies
that fail to get investments?

764
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,805
Why are you worrying about failing?
Are you not confident?

765
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:13,146
I heard that 2STO will be at the event,
looking for global partners. Is that true?

766
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,065
That's right.

767
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:20,945
As far as I know, they're looking for
partners in the AI field, specifically.

768
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:24,615
That only leaves two companies.

769
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,290
Forget about 2STO and global partners.

770
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,835
Once you obsess over the scale,
you'll feel pressured.

771
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,797
Just look for investors
who agree with your business philosophy.

772
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,051
Put aside all the pressure.
Step on stage with confidence.

773
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,222
Just show them
how excited and enthusiastic you are now,

774
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,016
and it'll be a success.

775
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,604
Don't be intimidated.

776
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,022
-Okay!
-Okay!

777
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,952
Oh, my.

778
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,498
Why are there clothes everywhere?

779
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:15,792
It's Demo Day today.

780
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,461
My team's future depends on my pitch.

781
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,588
What's wrong? You look amazing.

782
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,381
I look stupid.

783
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,092
And incompetent.

784
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,892
For money, of course.
What other reason could there be?

785
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,478
Right, it all comes down to money.

786
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:20,690
It's a good reason and also an honest one.

787
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:25,069
But I thought this kid would be different.

788
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,282
I thought she'd find a different reason.
Not money.

789
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,433
Have you found it?

790
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,788
You're really here.

791
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,792
Honey.

792
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,963
I was informed that you'd been
showing up by the Han River lately.

793
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,716
Are you the monster from The Host?
Why here?

794
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,761
My, you look so haggard.

795
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,930
Quit this and come back home.

796
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,807
Sang-su, you haven't changed a bit.

797
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:41,687
You went from being In-jae's secretary
to being your father's secretary?

798
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,522
Should that be called a promotion?

799
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,651
You've lived for money all your life,
not for pride.

800
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,820
Choose one. If you change the way you live
too fast, you'll get lost.

801
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,282
I've been working like a dog

802
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,035
for other people for the last 20 years.

803
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,496
Now I want to work for myself.

804
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,707
When a dog runs off,
it only becomes a stray dog.

805
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,086
And then what happens?
It either freezes or starves to death.

806
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,633
I'm sorry, honey.

807
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,387
I finally understand you.

808
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,723
If you understand me,
come with me while I'm being nice.

809
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,394
Hey!

810
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,771
"While I'm being nice"?

811
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,816
Are you going to hit her or something?

812
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,777
Ma'am, who are you?

813
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,612
Me?

814
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,868
I'm her ex-mother-in-law.
What? Do you have a problem?

815
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,790
Hey, leave before I call the police.

816
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,376
Hey, you too.

817
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:50,172
Leave. Get lost! Get in the car!

818
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,816
Does that help you relax?

819
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,028
I don't know. I've never taken it before.

820
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,156
Can I have one? I'm so nervous.

821
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,076
Too bad. I just took the last one.

822
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,454
Oh, I see.

823
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,417
Ms. Won, is the rumor true?

824
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,629
Are you really the girl on the swing
from the Sand Box logo?

825
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,214
Well, yes.

826
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,632
My gosh. For real?

827
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,843
I read about it in Ms. Yoon's book.

828
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,639
The girl who asked her dad to spread sand
on the ground after falling?

829
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,018
Yes, it seems so.

830
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,319
So Ms. Won was the beginning of Sand Box?

831
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,612
Exactly.

832
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,833
-Where are you going?
-Stop.

833
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,628
I have something I must tell Ms. Seo.

834
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,964
-Tell us instead.
-We'll relay every single word.

835
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:15,466
Jeez.

836
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,676
Fine.

837
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:19,804
How's Ms. Seo?

838
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:23,432
Our company's future is on the line.
Of course, she's nervous.

839
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,102
Ms. Seo said she felt like
she was walking a tightrope.

840
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,645
Walking a tightrope?

841
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,272
Then tell her this.

842
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:35,069
I'll be her plan B,
so she doesn't need to be nervous.

843
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,195
Plan B?

844
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,950
But what if she's also the wrong answer?
Then we're screwed.

845
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,370
-Then I'll invest personally.
-What?

846
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,664
That gives you a plan B
even if you fail this.

847
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:49,834
-Oh, you mean that plan B.
-Yes.

848
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,212
Tell her that.

849
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,352
What was that about?
The girl on the swing?

850
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,607
Fine, I borrowed your story
when I entered Sand Box.

851
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,985
But I didn't know
it'd become such a big deal.

852
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:19,280
I had no idea that our dad
meant so much to Ms. Yoon.

853
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:23,617
"Our dad"? How can you say that
after throwing away his last name?

854
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,412
How can you be so shameless
after stealing my memory?

855
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,289
Fine, I'm sorry.

856
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,877
But looking at you now,
I'm not sure if what I did was stealing.

857
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,004
What do you mean?

858
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,590
Answer this.

859
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,967
Who's scared of getting on the swing

860
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,969
and whimpering here, you or me?

861
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,056
Who's scared of failure now, you or me?

862
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,021
Do I still have to apologize to you?

863
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:02,907
Do-san.

864
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:04,783
Apologize to her.

865
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:07,912
You did steal it.

866
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,791
You were so insignificant
that you had to steal her memory.

867
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,545
You're not confident.

868
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,799
And you put on a show to hide that.

869
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,553
Isn't it tiring?

870
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,685
It must be.

871
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,567
What do you know?

872
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,527
I know it well.

873
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,365
I've done the same thing.

874
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,252
-Aren't they picking up?
-No.

875
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,796
The number you have dialed…

876
01:10:58,879 --> 01:10:59,713
Here they come.

877
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,260
Where were you? It's starting soon.

878
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,428
Hold on, Mr. Nam.

879
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:09,431
This isn't what you were going to wear
today, is it?

880
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,226
Weren't you going to wear a suit
for Ms. Seo?

881
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,437
A suit? For me?

882
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,732
What are you talking about?

883
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:21,860
Well…

884
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,782
Chul-san, can we talk?

885
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,493
What? Why?

886
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:32,496
Just follow me.

887
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:50,472
Why are you so slow?
They obviously need some time alone.

888
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,393
Oh…

889
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,106
Look at your face.
Is it because I'm holding your hand?

890
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,192
Why are you so easy?

891
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,112
Are you even burning up?

892
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,330
Ms. Jung.

893
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,752
When you lied to me the other day,

894
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,171
it felt like

895
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,633
I first rose to the top of a skyscraper
and then fell to the ground.

896
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,598
I know it didn't mean much to you,

897
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,518
but every little thing you do
can make me happy and sad

898
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,731
because I'm old-fashioned.

899
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:42,483
I mean it.

900
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,658
So I want you to stop

901
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,245
confusing me.

902
01:12:58,248 --> 01:12:59,208
Please.

903
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,838
Okay, I will.

904
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,799
All right.

905
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,264
Let's go back in.

906
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:16,850
Okay.

907
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:44,128
Do you remember the suit
I wore to the networking party?

908
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,047
I was going to wear that today.

909
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,633
Oh, that suit?

910
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,970
You looked fabulous that day.

911
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:55,431
Why didn't you wear it?

912
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,851
But that wasn't me.

913
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,563
Dal-mi.

914
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,151
I don't want to confuse you anymore.

915
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,490
So please forget everything
you've known about me

916
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,743
so far.

917
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,706
Forget everything I've known about you?
What do you mean?

918
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,752
I've never written letters to you.

919
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,338
I've only known you for a few months.

920
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:31,758
And this is how I dress.

921
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,636
Playing Go-Stop was never my dream.

922
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:39,433
My birthday isn't May 7.

923
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,062
If you're confused
about your feelings for me,

924
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,735
let's pretend nothing happened.

925
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,362
Let's forget everything.

926
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,992
I don't want you to suffer
because of that.

927
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,750
But let me tell you one thing.

928
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,342
Samsan Tech couldn't have gotten here

929
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,138
without you.

930
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,936
It's not fake.

931
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:27,147
It's a real achievement that you made.

932
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:33,904
I'm confident of that.

933
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,866
So never question it.

934
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,675
Ms. Seo, the rehearsal starts soon.
Let's go.

935
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,390
Dal-mi.

936
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,436
You can do this.

937
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,359
I can do this.

938
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,601
I'm not going to Ms. Seo.
Stop following me.

939
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:48,395
I'm not following you. I'm going up, too.

940
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,065
All right.

941
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,407
What you said earlier was really cool.

942
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,120
That you'll be Ms. Seo's plan B.
It was so reassuring.

943
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,956
I didn't say that
to hear a compliment from you.

944
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,877
You're such a kind and generous man.

945
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,131
Why were you so harsh on my brother?

946
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:20,177
Your brother?

947
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,015
Tell me.

948
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:27,517
Why did you

949
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:30,354
kill my brother?

950
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:50,165
Are you talking to me?
I killed your brother?

951
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,334
Yes.

952
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:57,839
You must be mistaken.

953
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,009
If I killed your brother, I can't be here.

954
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,220
I'd be in prison. That's absurd.

955
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,981
Look, I don't even know your brother.

956
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:19,653
I mean, I didn't even know
you had a brother, so how could I--

957
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,660
I didn't expect anything from you,

958
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,747
but I thought you'd at least remember him.

959
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,890
Ms. Seo said she felt like
she was walking a tightrope.

960
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,267
Walking a tightrope?

961
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,145
Then tell her this.

962
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,315
I'll be her plan B,
so she doesn't need to be nervous.

963
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,100
-Mr. Nam.
-I have something to ask you.

964
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,019
Sure, what is it?

965
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,647
The offer you made the other day.
That you'd give my company wings.

966
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,107
Yes?

967
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,485
Does the offer

968
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:43,945
still stand?

969
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,198
Yes, of course.

970
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,659
But what changed your mind?

971
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,247
I don't want plan B.

972
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:57,417
Plan B? What do you mean?

973
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,007
Plan B for when we fail.

974
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,659
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE BO-YOUNG

975
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:10,866
I had no idea I'd tell her I like her
while mixing noodles.

976
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,953
I pretended to be calm and cool,

977
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:20,917
but on the inside, I was super nervous.

978
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,377
You have no idea.

979
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,383
I want her to give me an honest answer.

980
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,594
But part of me…

981
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,308
Part of me is scared.

982
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:43,023
If she turns me down, it's over.
It's all over.

983
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,401
I'm scared.

984
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,867
I regret it.

985
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,579
Maybe I shouldn't have told her.

986
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,711
Maybe I should have hid my feelings
until the end.

987
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,890
No. You would have regretted that, too.

988
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:18,683
At least a little bit.

989
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:26,107
There's no point in regretting it now
because there's a reason for every choice.

990
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:29,527
So just trust your choice.

991
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,907
And when your trust falters like now,

992
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,371
you get a little help from someone else.

993
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:42,749
Who?

994
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,294
Your ancestors.

995
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,673
My ancestors?

996
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:03,770
I'm dying to know

997
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,647
who's right here.

998
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:09,484
This is where I began.
Not in an office with a Han River view.

999
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:10,777
Right here.

1000
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,823
What if the solution Ms. Seo came up with
is Mr. Han? Will you be able to accept it?

1001
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,741
What he said could be true.

1002
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,244
I guess we're having a rematch.

1003
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:23,289
If we run a test under the same specs,
we'll know which one is better.

1004
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:26,042
I don't want Dal-mi to suffer anymore.

1005
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,004
I'll do whatever it takes
to win the Demo Day.

1006
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:35,010
