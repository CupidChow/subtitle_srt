00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,405
EPISODE 11

2
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,168
What is this about?

3
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,962
-Can you spare us a moment?
-We want to ask you something.

4
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,803
GLOBAL ENTERPRISE 2STO
LOOKS TO SCOUT TOP TALENT

5
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,845
Oh, this?

6
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,265
Do you have specific engineers in mind?

7
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,601
Why? Are you interested?

8
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,937
Of course. We're very interested.

9
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,439
You don't care about the conditions?

10
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,027
It's 2STO. And the company's HQ
is even in Silicon Valley.

11
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,571
What more could we ask for?

12
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,785
Can you ditch your team?

13
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,372
-Of course.
-Of course.

14
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,176
Mr. Nam.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,388
I have something to ask you.

16
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,806
Sure, what is it?

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,101
The offer you made the other day.
That you'd give my company wings.

18
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,520
-Yes?
-Does the offer

19
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,773
still stand?

20
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,608
Yes, of course.

21
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,945
But what changed your mind?

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,031
I don't want a plan B.

23
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,075
Plan B? What do you mean?

24
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
Plan B for when we fail.

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,291
Sure, all right. Why not?

26
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,419
But I want to change the condition.

27
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,550
Take the entire Samsan Tech team.

28
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,051
What? The entire company?

29
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,804
-So you want us to buy out the company?
-Yes.

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,641
And we want to keep offering
the NoonGil service.

31
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,021
Look, Mr. Nam.

32
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,732
I really want to recruit you.

33
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,276
That's obviously why
I even met your parents.

34
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,403
Right, I heard.

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,823
CODA, NoonGil, and the Hackathon.

36
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,283
You've already proved yourself.

37
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,995
But acquiring the company
is a different issue.

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,416
I'm not a philanthropist.

39
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,215
And as for your teammates…
Honestly, I'm not sure.

40
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,177
There are plenty of other options
at Sand Box.

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,223
Who, specifically?

42
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,559
The engineers at Injae Company
are also very impressive.

43
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,858
Anyway, I'll see you on Demo Day.

44
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,362
Whether it'll be an acquisition
or simple recruitment, I'll decide after.

45
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,781
All right, then.

46
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,045
You must be mistaken.

47
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,464
If I killed your brother, I can't be here.

48
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,549
I'd be in prison. That's absurd.

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,603
Look, I don't even know your brother.

50
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,065
I mean, I didn't even know
you had a brother,

51
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,275
so how could I--

52
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,198
I didn't expect you to pray for him,

53
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,411
but I thought you'd at least remember him.

54
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,753
Mr. Han!

55
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,021
Are you all right? What's with him?

56
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,065
No idea. He said I killed his brother.

57
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,152
What? That was you?

58
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,570
What?

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you know something?

60
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,459
Was it five years ago? Just before
you were transferred to the US,

61
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,336
you were one of the judges on Demo Day.

62
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,838
SENIOR MANAGER HAN JI-PYEONG

63
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,220
CHARGING PARTNER

64
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
Charging Partner…

65
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,394
Kim Yong-san's brother is Kim Dong-su,
the CEO of Charging Partner.

66
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,236
PERSONAL PROFILE
NAME: KIM DONG-SU

67
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:19,170
Your product only works
with removable batteries, right?

68
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,340
-Yes.
-But from what I know,

69
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,635
companies will be completely forgoing
removable batteries in two years.

70
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,471
Were you not aware of that?

71
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,972
Oh, that's…

72
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,391
If that's the case,
you don't deserve the CEO title.

73
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,102
You're not up to date with info.

74
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,187
Did you know about it or not?

75
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,525
I did know about it.

76
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,611
That's a bigger problem. If you were
trying to secure funding knowing that…

77
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,071
Mr. Kim,

78
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,614
this is a fraud.

79
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,003
The thing is, I heard Kim Dong-su

80
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,383
took his own life
a little while after Demo Day.

81
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,115
SAMSAN TECH
ENGINEER KIM YONG-SAN

82
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,001
CHARGING PARTNER
KIM DONG-SU

83
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,512
My, look at all this. What is that thing?

84
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,728
Hey, what is this?

85
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,899
Hey, why go through my stuff?

86
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,942
You joined Sand Box?
What about grad school?

87
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,944
I couldn't wait because it'd be too late.

88
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,613
What the… So you dropped out?

89
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,657
They say you should dissuade anyone
from starting a start-up.

90
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,498
"Never let someone's opinion
become your reality."

91
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,458
Said Les Brown.

92
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,503
You've got some nerve.

93
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,464
-Do Mom and Dad know?
-Nope.

94
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:30,092
Hey, don't tell anyone about my start-up.
Okay?

95
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,719
Come on. For free?

96
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,055
When you want something,
you've got to give first.

97
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,224
-I'm broke.
-Okay, I'm calling Mom and Dad.

98
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,850
Gosh, hey! Seriously.

99
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,312
Fine, I'll give you money.

100
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,233
I'm so broke. I can't believe
you're taking money from me.

101
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,238
Come on. You'll be rich soon.
You are a CEO.

102
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,033
Thank you. How much is this?

103
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,035
So are you happy now?

104
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,204
-You did seem excited these days.
-I'm happy.

105
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,874
-Look.
-Wow, that's so cool.

106
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,376
I'm really excited.

107
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,505
-That looks so cool.
-Here, look.

108
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,465
-My, that's a nice photo.
-Right?

109
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,261
ENGINEER
KIM YONG-SAN

110
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,804
Idiot.

111
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,098
Why were you so excited?

112
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,521
What was so hard
that you had to kill yourself?

113
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,191
That asshole

114
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,777
doesn't even remember you.

115
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,381
SAMSAN TECH

116
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,261
Samsan Tech couldn't have gotten here
without you.

117
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,346
I'm confident of that.

118
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,641
So never question it.

119
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,987
CHEONGSIMHWAN

120
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,158
What is this?

121
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,493
Anxiety pills. Don't you need one?

122
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,875
Not anymore. I pulled myself together.

123
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,128
The CEOs will decide who will go first.

124
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,755
Please gather over here.

125
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,715
Pick one. One per person. Here.

126
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,985
This time, I'm going first.

127
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,035
Looks like you'll need the anxiety pills.

128
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,175
Gosh. I got scared for a second
thinking I picked number six,

129
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,385
but I got nine.

130
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,261
Well done. We're so lucky.

131
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,680
What the heck?
Are they trying to piss us off?

132
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,060
They think it's unlucky.
As in 666, the devil's number.

133
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,233
I like six. It's a whole number.
It's a perfect number.

134
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,985
That's right!
Six is the most perfect number.

135
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,155
It really is the best. It's perfect.

136
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,078
You're right.

137
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,840
-Hey, Do-san. Can we talk?
-What?

138
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,928
We need to talk too.

139
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,517
Hey, don't pull my sleeve. Hey.

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,979
Gosh, hey. Seriously.
You're going to rip my sleeve. Let go.

141
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,233
Do-san, you know that I have no interest
in others' relationships.

142
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,526
I'm cool like that.

143
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,321
But I have to take an interest
in your relationship

144
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,658
as it could gravely affect the company
and I'm a shareholder.

145
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,244
"Gravely affect the company"?
That's nonsense.

146
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,829
No, it's not.

147
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,206
The CEO is dating
the majority shareholder.

148
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,000
If you two start having problems,

149
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,585
it'll affect the company as well.

150
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,171
A public company
would have to announce it.

151
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,550
Gosh, don't worry.
It won't affect the company in any way.

152
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,511
Is that so? So you guys are back together?

153
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,054
No.

154
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,765
-It's just like a reset.
-A reset?

155
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,559
What do you mean?

156
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,436
I didn't want to confuse Dal-mi,

157
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,355
so I told her to forget everything
she knows about me.

158
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,485
Did you get shot in the head or something?

159
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,778
You told her to forget you
and go to Mr. Han?

160
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,406
No. Hey, this is…

161
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,869
-Is that what it sounds like?
-Yes, that's what he meant.

162
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,746
"I'll give up and forget you,

163
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,623
so don't worry. Just go to Mr. Han."

164
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,045
I thought Do-san would get all clingy.
I'm surprised.

165
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,131
That's what you think?

166
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,260
That's not what it sounded like to me.

167
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,137
Then what did it sound like?

168
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,681
Dal-mi must be so confused right now.

169
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,976
She probably can't tell
who Mr. Han or I are.

170
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,395
So I told her to basically
hit the reset button

171
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,023
and just see me

172
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,027
for who I really am from now on.

173
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,362
Well…

174
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,323
Do you really think
that's how she took it?

175
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,867
Yes! I really think
that's what he meant by it.

176
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,703
Is that right? Are you sure
it's not your wishful thinking?

177
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,873
Gosh, you're weird.

178
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,501
Are you always this nosy
about others' business?

179
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,670
We're a team.

180
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,756
We work together,
so I can't help but be curious.

181
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,592
Who has captured our CEO's heart?

182
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,719
Our majority shareholder, Mr. Nam?

183
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,430
Or our mentor, Mr. Han?

184
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,975
I'm not sure.

185
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,187
How do I figure it out?

186
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,607
-You really don't know?
-No.

187
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,278
I really can't figure it out.

188
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,446
And I'm more curious than anyone.

189
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,493
Who

190
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,454
has my heart?

191
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,499
So what if her conclusion is Mr. Han?

192
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,001
Then,

193
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,378
can you accept it?

194
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,339
Can you continue to work with her?

195
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,967
Yes.

196
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,512
If that is Dal-mi's choice.

197
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,266
-I'd have to accept it.
-Goodness.

198
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,935
Even if he shows off his money
and hits on her,

199
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,229
you'll just sit around and wait for her?

200
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,190
All that tension
will only make her uncomfortable.

201
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,444
I don't want to stress her out anymore.

202
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,906
You're so understanding. This is something
only Hollywood actors would do.

203
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,991
You're awfully cool with this, dude.

204
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,290
Look. What's Mr. Han doing
with Ms. Seo over there?

205
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,043
Where? Where are they?

206
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,253
Hey, where?

207
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,380
Your words and actions don't match.

208
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,258
I've reviewed your code
for thousands of cases.

209
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,969
Just one look in your eyes
and I know what you're thinking.

210
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,972
Your eyes say you haven't given up.

211
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,849
I can tell that you've made a decision.

212
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,977
What is that decision?

213
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,648
-Chul-san.
-Yes.

214
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,026
You know, the plan B Mr. Han offered.

215
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,405
I don't want it.

216
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,076
What? Why would you turn down
such a great offer?

217
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,452
I don't want it either.

218
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,665
Hey, where the heck have you been?

219
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,459
Not just that. I no longer want
anything to do with him.

220
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,131
What's with the both of you today?

221
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,967
Why are you being so extreme?

222
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,260
He's been helping us out

223
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,680
because of Ms. Seo,
not for Samsan Tech's sake.

224
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,016
Am I wrong?

225
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,896
He'll invest as if he's giving alms?
I'm sure it'd bother you the most.

226
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,483
I don't want to do that.

227
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,528
That plan B will put pressure
on Mr. Han as well.

228
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,530
And most importantly,

229
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:33,158
accepting that
will be like negating everything,

230
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,706
including all the time and effort we put
into Samsan Tech's accomplishments.

231
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,208
My pride won't allow that.

232
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,419
"Pride"?

233
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,505
Who's the one that got down
on her knees and begged me?

234
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,091
Who?

235
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,052
Someone did that? I don't remember.

236
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,055
Fine, I'll just say
I don't remember either.

237
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,225
Since you don't want to take plan B.

238
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,606
Yes, we must win the upcoming Demo Day
no matter what.

239
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,775
Come here, guys.

240
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,030
All right. Let's win

241
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,907
and go to Silicon Valley together, okay?

242
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,869
-Yes, let's go to Silicon Valley.
-We can do it. We got this!

243
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,582
Go, team!

244
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,878
Let's do this!

245
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,428
A STAGE WHERE INVESTORS
WITHDRAW THEIR INVESTMENTS

246
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,014
BY SELLING THEIR SHARES,
M&A, LIQUIDATION, ETC.

247
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,188
JUDGE HAN JI-PYEONG

248
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,320
The number you have dialed…

249
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,323
-Is everything okay with Mr. Han?
-I wonder, too.

250
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,785
He's not picking up. What's going on?

251
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,915
Ms. Yoon, we should get started now.

252
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,876
All right.

253
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,050
JUDGE YOON SEON-HAK
SH VENTURE CAPITAL

254
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,522
Hello. I'm Yoon Seon-hak,
the director of Sand Box

255
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,274
and CEO of SH Venture Capital.

256
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,613
Though this is our 12th Demo Day
here at Sand Box,

257
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,533
I'm excited and thrilled
as if it were the very first time.

258
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,244
The ten teams waiting backstage
at the moment

259
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,289
are probably even more excited than I am.

260
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,708
The winner of this Demo Day

261
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,086
will receive 50 million won.

262
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,047
Also, teams that successfully secure
additional funding

263
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,175
can maintain all the benefits
they have been receiving

264
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,177
as residency winners.

265
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,097
So, if we fail to secure funding,

266
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,516
we'll be kicked out
and lose all the benefits…

267
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,312
However, we shouldn't be concerned

268
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,275
because we will secure funding
and become a global company.

269
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,862
In addition to the investors
who are present here today,

270
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,448
we have other investors
from around the globe with us.

271
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,582
Many investors around the globe
are joining us live.

272
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,376
All right. Let's meet the teams now.

273
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,547
First up is the team I mentored myself.

274
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,259
We see them on the news often these days.

275
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,678
Ms. Won In-jae, the CEO of Injae Company.

276
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,430
Let's welcome her with a big hand.

277
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,689
-Injae. We got this!
-Injae, Injae. We got this!

278
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,169
Hello. I'm Won In-jae,
CEO of Injae Company.

279
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,091
In this country,
there are eight million CCTV cameras

280
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,345
installed for crime prevention
and property protection purposes.

281
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,388
But unfortunately, many of them

282
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,016
aren't really utilized
until after crimes take place.

283
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,393
Of course, they help us prevent crimes.

284
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,896
But it's the human eye that has to monitor

285
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,857
all these CCTV screens all day long, 24-7.

286
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,236
So inevitably, we often miss
important clues or evidence.

287
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,696
And there's a physical limit as well.

288
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,076
Technology exists to help us
overcome such human limitations.

289
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,035
TO OVERCOME LIMITATIONS

290
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,788
Injae Company's AI solution,

291
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,624
Guardians AI, is that technology.

292
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,044
As you can see, Guardians AI's network

293
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,630
is designed to spot
suspicious persons or activities

294
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,633
and immediately alert organizations
that are in direct relation

295
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,468
to the situation.

296
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,347
The human recognition technology
is one of the keys in spotting

297
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,599
suspicious activities
through live CCTV footage.

298
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,102
We've managed to bump up
its accuracy to 93.2 percent.

299
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,981
-And to reduce operational costs,
-What? 93.2?

300
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
we've even made sure to…

301
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,527
What's our accuracy rate?

302
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,195
Ours is 92.4 percent.

303
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
That sounds like bullshit.

304
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,367
Bullshit! Their accuracy
can't be higher than ours.

305
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,953
No. Based on their IR report,
it's not bullshit.

306
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,247
For parking control,
it goes up to 99.98 percent.

307
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,707
Hey, quiet down.

308
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,500
Are you trying to discourage Ms. Seo?

309
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,711
Thank you for your presentation.

310
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,921
Now, we'll accept some questions.

311
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,550
Don't you have many competitors
in Korea alone?

312
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,801
Yes, we do.

313
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:48,348
However, no other company has managed
to reach our level of accuracy.

314
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,768
What I'm more interested in
than its efficiency

315
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,230
is how effective it will be
in terms of reducing labor costs.

316
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,816
According to the Ministry
of the Interior and Safety,

317
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,360
one person can monitor
up to 50 pieces of footage.

318
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,279
With the help of our solution,

319
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,698
that can be bumped up to 300.

320
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,118
So theoretically, the labor costs
will be one-sixth of what it used to be.

321
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,039
Using Haun Engineering
and Construction as an example…

322
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,540
let's say we reduce the average salary.

323
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,918
-The average salary is 36.4 million.
-That's why your dad started protesting.

324
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,920
-Yes.
-If it's reduced to one-sixth of--

325
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,089
I have a question for Ms. Won In-jae.

326
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,467
Oh, this voice sounds very familiar.

327
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,303
You can't ask her a question now.

328
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,348
I'm on Haun's security team.

329
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,849
I'm Nam Seong-hwan.

330
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,102
Sir, please leave
unless you are authorized to be here.

331
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,854
I have the right to be here!

332
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,191
I'm about to lose my job
because of that company.

333
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,902
Who has more right to be here than I do?

334
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,168
-Sir, you can't do this.
-Let go!

335
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,419
-Hand me the mic!
-No.

336
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,296
-Hey, get him.
-Let go!

337
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,090
-You can't do this, sir.
-Mr. Park.

338
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,176
It's okay. We'll let him ask his question.

339
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,761
Sir, please go ahead.

340
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,721
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,731
You folks insist that it's innovation,

342
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,609
but it directly affects our lives
and livelihood.

343
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,779
For you, it's about
cutting the costs by a bit--

344
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,072
By 3.6 billion won.

345
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,367
It's not "a bit."

346
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,291
Yes, 3.6 billion won.

347
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,754
So many people rely on that money
as it's their sole income.

348
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,172
How will they survive now?

349
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,593
You're pushing us to the edge of a cliff.
So please explain.

350
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,221
What is your justification?

351
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,273
Why am I doing this?

352
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,236
She knows what to do
and how to accomplish it.

353
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,530
But I have to say,

354
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,449
I don't think she knows

355
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,369
why she's doing this.

356
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,083
Some people said something similar
about a hundred years ago.

357
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,961
When taxis first hit the streets,
rickshaw pullers protested

358
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,713
like you're doing now.

359
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,215
If we prioritized their livelihood

360
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,009
over innovation,

361
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,761
we'd have to take rickshaws
instead of taxis now.

362
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,890
Forget cell phones.
We'd still be using old-school phones

363
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,308
with telephone operators.

364
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,437
Is that the world you want?

365
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,025
No, right?

366
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,321
The same goes for our children
and descendants.

367
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,616
They, too, would want the world to change

368
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,493
for the better.

369
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,500
I wish to make the world a better place.

370
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,211
That's why I'm doing this.

371
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,089
She's found her answer.

372
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,387
And that is your son's aspiration as well.

373
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,018
His son? Who is his son?

374
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,603
I'm curious.

375
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,815
Your son is also participating
in this residency program.

376
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,571
And he has also come up
with a downsizing solution using AI.

377
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,074
So…

378
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,203
why attack me when your son
has chosen the exact same path?

379
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,334
What? He's your father?

380
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,796
That's cheating. Why drag Do-san's family
into this? It's so underhanded.

381
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,486
You're right.

382
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,198
My son

383
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,451
has chosen the same path.

384
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,543
If everyone in this world
were like you and my son,

385
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,547
this world would quickly become
an innovative place.

386
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,175
But it's never good to move too fast.

387
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,762
That speed can hurt many people.

388
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,306
We'll see a lot of people

389
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,933
lose their jobs,
unable to adapt to the changes.

390
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,394
We need people like me

391
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,564
to slow things down a little.

392
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,527
To help find the right pace
that allows people to adjust and live.

393
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,074
And to find that pace,

394
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,827
I will continue to fight.

395
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,628
My son has chosen a path

396
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,631
that is different from mine.

397
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,385
He has his own life,

398
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,347
and so do I.

399
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,815
My son will march forward to the future,

400
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,900
and I

401
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,820
will fight to protect my present.

402
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,783
Somewhere between the two,

403
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,203
we'll find the ideal pace

404
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,497
of innovation.

405
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,484
Dad.

406
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,532
See? You can look me in the eye.

407
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,451
Why have you been avoiding me?

408
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,312
Your father…

409
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,607
is so inspiring.

410
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,289
So what do we do
if we want to invest in Injae Company?

411
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,040
Are you still accepting investments?

412
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,127
Not from you, sir.

413
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,090
I'm not here to secure
additional investments.

414
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,677
I can run the company
with the sales alone.

415
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,348
I am looking for a global partner
for Injae Company.

416
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,561
I'm honored.

417
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,105
I was very impressed with your pitch.

418
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,568
And I think your company is qualified
to become 2STO's global partner.

419
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,279
However,

420
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,241
there's another team
that we're considering.

421
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,744
Can I decide after their presentation?

422
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,625
Sure.

423
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,668
Is that us?

424
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,900
Should we tweak the numbers
in our presentation?

425
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,861
Numbers? What numbers?

426
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,447
As you heard, their accuracy rate
is higher than ours.

427
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,074
Let's bump it up a little.

428
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,159
Shall we?

429
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,079
Let's do that.
We can increase the actual rate later.

430
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,413
We can…

431
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,623
I mean, you can do that.

432
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,054
ASSISTANT MANAGER HAN YU-JIN

433
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,723
Next up is team number six.

434
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,853
Mr. Han Ji-pyeong was their mentor.

435
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,648
He couldn't be here today
due to personal reasons,

436
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,733
so I have the honor
to introduce them to you.

437
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,903
-We saw him earlier.
-Their AI app is called NoonGil.

438
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,239
-"Personal reasons"?
-It was created for the visually impaired.

439
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,200
-What's going on?
-And has a record-high user number.

440
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,661
We should be worried about us now,
not Mr. Han.

441
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,162
-Let's focus.
-All right, guys.

442
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,373
Gather around.

443
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,293
One, two, three.

444
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,003
-Go, Samsan Tech!
-Go, Samsan Tech!

445
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,213
-Good luck.
-You got this!

446
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,174
Let me introduce Ms. Seo Dal-mi,
the CEO of Samsan Tech.

447
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,844
-You got this!
-Best of luck!

448
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,971
-Good luck!
-Break a leg!

449
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,350
Go for it!

450
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,944
JUDGE HAN JI-PYEONG

451
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,327
Hello. I'm Seo Dal-mi, CEO of Samsan Tech.

452
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,585
Technology makes your life
easier and more convenient.

453
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:05,048
But it can make some people's lives
more difficult.

454
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,509
The visually impaired, for example.

455
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,180
If we ignore their needs
and blindly strive for innovation,

456
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,100
many people who can't adapt to change
will suffer.

457
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,105
We, at Samsan Tech, are aware
that technology's main aim is to innovate,

458
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,150
but we also believe that it exists
to help such people.

459
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,403
Now, I will show you what I mean by that.

460
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,742
Yeong-sil, can you read the text
in front of me?

461
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,204
NoonGil is an AI-based service
developed to assist

462
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,165
the visually impaired
in their day-to-day activities,

463
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,168
inspired by guide dogs.

464
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,926
Yeong-sil, what do you see now?

465
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,429
Two women and four men are sitting.

466
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,771
Nice.

467
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,403
About 250,000 people in this country
are visually impaired, right?

468
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,614
Since the solution's target group
is very specific,

469
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:15,410
I'm thinking
the market would be pretty small.

470
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,705
We're targeting the 40 million people
with visual impairment worldwide.

471
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,957
Noongil is currently available
in English and Chinese,

472
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,960
and we plan to offer our service
in other languages as well.

473
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,799
JUDGE ALEX KWON

474
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,637
I'm very interested
in Samsan Tech's technology.

475
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,765
Could you tell me
your human recognition accuracy rate?

476
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,883
We can increase the actual rate later.
We can…

477
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,384
I mean, you can do that.

478
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,689
No, let's not do that.
Let's just be honest.

479
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,650
But Injae Company's accuracy
is higher than ours.

480
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,154
Let's bump it up by just a little bit.

481
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,199
That "little bit" will make
the 92.4 percent look fake.

482
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
It's okay, guys. 92.4 is pretty good.

483
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,298
NoonGil's human recognition accuracy rate

484
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,804
is 92.4 percent.

485
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,265
That's a bit low
compared to the other team's.

486
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,850
Not necessarily.

487
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,187
It's not just about the numbers.

488
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,606
The environment also plays a huge role.

489
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,610
As you know, NoonGil is a mobile app.

490
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,364
And we had to keep its battery usage
to a minimum to make sure

491
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,407
the visually impaired
could use it all day.

492
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,993
Therefore,
we had to find the middle ground

493
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,913
between a high accuracy rate
and reducing the app size.

494
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,457
We did that, too.

495
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,793
It's always the incompetent ones
that talk a lot.

496
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,546
Then how about we do this?

497
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,965
Can someone from Injae Company
come up on stage?

498
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,141
Let's go.

499
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,245
That's a single-board computer.

500
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,747
Does he want them to run
their AI software on it?

501
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,710
I guess so. Is that possible though?

502
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,044
No. No way.

503
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,508
Well, isn't this too extreme?

504
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,887
They're both pitching their app sizes
and human recognition technology.

505
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,638
Testing them in the same environment

506
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,183
will tell us which one is better.

507
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,979
So this is round two,
following the Hackathon.

508
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,463
What do you think?

509
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,506
Not sure.

510
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,426
Frankly, I don't feel confident.

511
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,346
We've never tested it on such low RAM.

512
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,722
Can it run on this thing?

513
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,099
No. You can't even run Tetris on this.

514
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,194
Our solution won't run on this, will it?

515
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,154
No.

516
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,324
It won't. But theirs won't either.

517
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,579
Then why did he suggest this test?

518
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,333
-To invalidate their excuse.
-What do you mean?

519
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,837
They said their accuracy is lower
because they had to reduce the size.

520
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,257
He obviously suggested this
to show everyone

521
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,883
that their claim is false.

522
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,011
Does that mean we're Alex's pick?

523
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,890
Probably.

524
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,812
On the flash drive,
you'll find Sand Box's CCTV footage.

525
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:56,816
Put that footage through your human
recognition software. That's fair, right?

526
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,944
-Yes.
-Yes.

527
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,480
SAMSAN TECH

528
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,542
I can't believe this.

529
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,420
SAMSAN TECH

530
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,921
The program is actually running.

531
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,006
SAMSAN TECH

532
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,848
My gosh! This… This doesn't make sense!

533
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,600
What? It's working?

534
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,185
Ours is working fine, right?

535
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,312
It works? How?

536
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,773
I can't believe this.

537
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,861
I knew it'd work.

538
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,240
I totally knew it.

539
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,417
-So we won, right?
-Yes.

540
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,548
Hey, come here. Get over here.

541
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,014
Get off me!

542
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,475
-I said, get off me!
-Come here.

543
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,143
What are they doing?

544
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,778
12TH DEMO DAY WINNER

545
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,421
We fought well.

546
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,965
We'll take one more. Look over here.

547
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,425
All right.

548
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,471
Look at the camera. Here we go.

549
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,807
One, two, three!

550
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,769
12TH DEMO DAY WINNER

551
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,736
But what's the use?
You have nothing to entice investors.

552
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,321
What is your business model?

553
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,615
And how will you generate
consistent profit?

554
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,617
You don't have a clear picture.

555
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,411
Are you naive or stupid?

556
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,121
Were you going to give away
the whole algorithm?

557
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,124
I can guarantee that you guys will fail.

558
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,503
After seeing this shareholders' list,
no one will be stupid enough

559
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,797
to invest in your company. No one.

560
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,634
And the biggest problem here is that

561
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,429
the CEO can't resolve the situation.

562
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,389
The more users, the higher the cost.

563
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,724
Who'd invest in this?

564
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,922
Mr. Park was right.

565
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,050
He said you wouldn't be coming
as you're beating yourself up.

566
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,760
I'm sorry.

567
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,974
Our job is to give candid feedback
even if it's hurtful at times.

568
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,268
Naturally, some will resent us.

569
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,815
That day, you pointed out issues
that had to be addressed.

570
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,402
Had you not brought them up,
I would've done it myself.

571
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,404
Do you really think it was necessary?

572
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,241
Ms. Yoon.

573
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,496
I always told the guys at Samsan Tech
that they wouldn't make it.

574
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,792
But they won today.

575
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,046
Maybe Kim Yong-san

576
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,216
was right after all.

577
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,401
Grandma! Grandma!

578
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,320
Gosh, my pumpkin. You're home.

579
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,614
Why are you so excited today?

580
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,991
You'll be very surprised.

581
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,951
I told you about Demo Day.

582
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,079
Guess how we did. Third place? Second?

583
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,664
No, number one!

584
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,083
-What? Really?
-Yes!

585
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,459
Your team won?

586
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:11,964
I told In-jae.

587
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,758
-I told her I'd outdo her in three years.
-Right.

588
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,471
But in hindsight, I think
I underestimated myself big-time.

589
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,848
I don't need three years.

590
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,350
Of course, you don't! You were too humble.

591
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,022
My sweet pumpkin. I'm so proud of you.

592
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,778
-Grandma.
-Yes?

593
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,905
-Something's up with you.
-What?

594
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,119
Why are you so sweet today?

595
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,206
I have to say,
it feels very contrived for some reason.

596
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,170
Gosh, what are you talking about?
I'm always sweet to you.

597
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,797
That's not true.
You're always indifferent.

598
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,511
Are you hiding something from me?

599
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,599
What? Why would I?

600
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,643
I'm not hiding anything.

601
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,687
Dal-mi.

602
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,252
My answer is no.

603
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,463
Do you have no backbone?
Don't you resent her?

604
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,384
Hey, I obviously resent her
more than you do.

605
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,344
Then why bring her here?

606
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:43,347
If you cut ties with everyone
for all sorts of reasons,

607
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,432
you'll be left all alone in the end.

608
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,394
That's why it's easier to forgive
when you're older.

609
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,604
I'm not your age, so I don't know.

610
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,232
Mom has a nice house.

611
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,567
What's she doing here
when she lives in a mansion?

612
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,987
Tell her to leave.

613
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,573
I met her husband.

614
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,742
It looked like he'd hit her
if I sent her back.

615
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,411
That's why I brought her here.

616
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,958
Your mom…

617
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,796
Her life hasn't been as easy
as we thought.

618
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,219
So what should I do?

619
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,013
Do you want me to just kick her out?

620
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,055
Don't you think beef ribs
are a bit too much?

621
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,017
If it's too festive,
Do-san will be uncomfortable.

622
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,770
Still, his team won.
Pork isn't good enough.

623
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,564
That's true.

624
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,033
Let's forgo this, then. We make this
for parties and celebrations, you know.

625
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,201
Okay, sure.

626
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,457
Honey, did you also see
the CEO of Do-san's company?

627
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,584
I sure did.

628
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,177
She's very well-spoken and smart.

629
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,014
Now, I know she didn't lure him
into making her the CEO.

630
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,684
She's surely competent.
A natural CEO, I'd say.

631
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:55,687
Really?

632
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,024
Then maybe Do-san should
make a move on her.

633
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,528
No, he shouldn't. He should draw a line
between work and his personal life.

634
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,821
Goodness. Look who's talking.

635
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,782
You crossed that line and hit on me.

636
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,120
That's true.

637
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:16,333
I definitely had a knack
for crossing that line.

638
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,211
Do-san should learn that skill from you.

639
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,511
-I'm home!
-Hi!

640
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,764
Hey, you're back. Did you have dinner?

641
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,641
No, not yet. What's all this?

642
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,519
I just put out the stuff we had.
It's pretty simple.

643
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,480
I'll go wash my hands quickly.

644
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,150
Oh, Dad.

645
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:46,113
Teach me how to cross that line
between personal and professional life.

646
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,906
Sure.

647
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,456
Hold on. He must've heard everything.

648
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,209
That's not important.

649
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,129
He's saying
he's interested in that CEO girl.

650
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,718
-Honey.
-What?

651
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,470
-Let's take that japchae back out.
-Sounds good.

652
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,874
Are you looking for Mr. Han?

653
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,085
Oh, yes.

654
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,963
He's not texting me back.

655
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,423
He's taking a sick day.

656
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,926
He is? He's not feeling well?

657
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,929
I'm not sure.
He's never taken a day off before.

658
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,723
I'm going to visit him later.

659
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,044
QUESTION BOMBER

660
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,213
Hello?

661
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,467
Hello?

662
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,680
-Hello?
-Hello, it's me.

663
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,808
Mr. Park told me
that you're taking a sick day.

664
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,186
Park Dong-cheon…

665
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,271
He must've misheard me.

666
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,690
I'm just taking a day off.

667
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:48,652
I'm not allowed to carry over my accrued
vacation days, so I used one today.

668
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,238
I see. I'm glad you're okay.

669
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,282
Anyway, what's up?

670
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,204
Well, you watched Demo Day, right?

671
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,125
Of course. Congratulations.

672
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,585
You guys did really well.

673
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,299
Thank you. We owe it all to you.

674
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,094
No, that's not true.

675
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,763
I didn't even do anything.

676
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,642
All I did was nitpick at everything.

677
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,814
We wouldn't be where we are today
without your nitpicking.

678
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,194
Thank you. I really mean it.

679
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,828
Mr. Han?

680
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:47,836
Sorry, I'm driving right now.
I'm going on a trip with my friends.

681
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,296
Oh, I'm sorry.

682
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,839
Then…

683
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,841
Have a good day.

684
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,885
You, too.

685
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,819
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

686
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,666
You didn't sound too well,

687
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,211
so I left some abalone porridge
at your door.

688
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,922
What? She was in front of my door?

689
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,531
SHOW CARE THROUGH FOOD

690
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,653
So, how much?

691
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,406
2STO would like to offer you…

692
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,409
three billion won
for acquiring Samsan Tech.

693
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,042
Three billion?

694
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,003
And you'll work at our HQ

695
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,006
in Silicon Valley for three years
following the acquisition.

696
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,012
What do you say?

697
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,349
We can continue to offer
the NoonGil service, right?

698
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,310
Of course.

699
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,818
We'll go through this
and get in touch with you.

700
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,072
We'll hope for a positive response.

701
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,087
Ms. Seo, please let me know.

702
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,213
Will do.

703
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,185
-Yes!
-Yes, three billion won!

704
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,062
-Three billion!
-Three billion!

705
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,314
-Three billion!
-Three billion!

706
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,702
Hey, is this a dream?

707
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,538
Three billion won and 2STO?

708
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,123
Going global is more important.

709
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,250
That's right!

710
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,879
Does this mean we need to come up
with an English name for everyone?

711
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,632
I already have one, Stephanie.

712
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,262
I can speak English,
but business English is different.

713
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,597
Should I get a tutor?

714
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,141
Hang on.

715
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,812
Does it mean the name,
Samsan Tech, will be gone?

716
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,982
But it'll become part of 2STO.

717
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,237
Samsan Tech…

718
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,281
Come on, guys!

719
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,993
Let's focus on the good things.

720
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,039
-Yes, three billion!
-Three billion won!

721
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,125
-Silicon Valley, here we come!
-Yes!

722
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,920
-Three billion won!
-Three billion won!

723
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,505
-Come on, guys!
-Three billion!

724
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,550
-Three billion won!
-Three billion won!

725
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,969
-Three billion won!
-Three billion won!

726
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,347
Jeez, they're so loud.

727
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,393
Why would they acquire Samsan Tech
for three billion?

728
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,186
Don't you think it's odd?

729
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,036
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

730
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,873
NAM DO-SAN
INQUIRE TO INVEST

731
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,589
Why are you still here?

732
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,924
Oh, I was about to leave.

733
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,968
Why'd you come back?

734
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,803
I left my phone.

735
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,103
It's that retro business card.

736
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,355
Yes.

737
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,610
That reminds me.

738
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,112
The day I quit my job,

739
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,907
I visited your office
because I was curious.

740
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,950
-Remember?
-Yes.

741
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,955
I almost went to that address that day.

742
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,084
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

743
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,712
So where is Seo Dal-mi headed?

744
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,298
What's the address on your business card?

745
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,550
Our office. You've been here.

746
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,010
Let's do this.

747
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,680
You're here.

748
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,895
Wow, this office is huge.

749
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,523
-Is this your office?
-Yes.

750
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,945
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

751
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,573
Are you still curious?

752
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,952
About my real office.

753
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,870
What?

754
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,001
Do you want to see it?

755
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,090
Yes.

756
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,637
SAMSAN TECH

757
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,228
It's huge.

758
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,567
-Hey, what's this smell?
-What?

759
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,737
It's from grilling sirloin.

760
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:33,116
The smell travels all the way
from the famous BBQ restaurant downstairs.

761
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,203
If you eat gimbap here
with your eyes closed,

762
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,247
it'll taste like premium beef.

763
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,791
Come on. No way.

764
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,257
Wait, maybe you're right.
I think I believe you now.

765
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,800
Seriously, for real.

766
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,058
Hey, what's that?

767
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,643
DOSAN TECH

768
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,772
This is still here.

769
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,235
The company was originally called
Dosan Tech, after my name.

770
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,572
So you started it.

771
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,116
Yes.

772
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,455
Why did you pick this place?

773
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:26,127
The rent is cheap
and the utility bills are cheap here.

774
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,172
And the night view is amazing.

775
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,675
-The night view?
-Yes.

776
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,808
You're right.

777
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,315
This is as nice as the view
overlooking the Han River.

778
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,709
This is where I really started.

779
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,051
Not the office overlooking the Han River.

780
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,973
This was it.

781
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,190
SAMSAN TECH
ON STANDBY 24/7

782
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,529
Do you want to see the office?

783
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,990
-Can I?
-Of course.

784
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,912
Be careful.
There are a lot of steps though.

785
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,707
Watch your step, okay?

786
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,668
Watch your step.

787
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,923
No one wants to move in here.
There's no AC, so it gets very hot.

788
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,551
-Really?
-The landlord even lowered the rent.

789
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,856
This door is broken,
so it normally just opens.

790
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,108
Did something get stuck?

791
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,829
-Do you need a hand?
-No. Dal-mi, step back for a second.

792
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,039
It's dangerous.

793
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,000
Darn it. This is embarrassing.

794
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,919
One, two, three!

795
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,091
-Gosh.
-Chul-san.

796
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,514
-Sa-ha.
-It's so dusty here.

797
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,647
What are you two doing here?

798
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,689
I wonder too.

799
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,795
Whatever you're imagining now
did not happen. Don't get the wrong idea.

800
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,755
What are we imagining?

801
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,257
Stuff that you'd assume
a man and a woman would do.

802
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,760
I can see it in your eyes.

803
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,053
So dirty.

804
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,848
-"Dirty"?
-"Dirty"?

805
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,267
Gosh, let me explain.

806
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,645
I got all sentimental after we talked

807
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,438
about how Samsan Tech would be gone.

808
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,234
So naturally, I wanted to come
to this rooftop office after a long time.

809
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,487
I was spacing out and didn't realize
my backpack was open.

810
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,280
And Sa-ha happened to see it.

811
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,533
"Chul-san, your backpack is open."

812
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,536
But I couldn't hear her,
so I just got on the bus.

813
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,830
"My gosh, does he want to be
pickpocketed?"

814
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,791
She got all worried and followed me.

815
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,085
And here we are.

816
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,130
We didn't do anything "dirty."
We're very clean.

817
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,257
Are we good now?

818
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,178
Do you believe them?

819
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:05,805
Nope.

820
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,143
Jeez, you annoying pair of cockroaches.

821
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,610
What are you all doing here?

822
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,583
You guys are ridiculous.

823
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,959
Don't get the wrong idea.

824
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,503
Yes, we all came here for the same reason.

825
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,629
Sure, whatever.

826
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,173
-Not "whatever"!
-Not "whatever"!

827
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:44,427
Hey, what's going to happen to us
after working in Silicon Valley

828
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,220
for three years?

829
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,851
I'd be very rich by then,

830
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,772
so I'm going to build a huge resort

831
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,440
at my family's maesaengi farm.

832
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,649
I'm going to get a dog.

833
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,526
What? That's a humble dream.

834
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,779
I need a house with a big yard
to get a dog.

835
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,285
What about you, Dal-mi? What will you do?

836
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,745
-Me?
-Yes.

837
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,457
I want to…

838
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,253
Never mind. I'll just keep it to myself.

839
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,005
-Why?
-What was that?

840
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,257
-Finish your sentence.
-What do you want to do?

841
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,676
I was thinking

842
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,139
it'd be nice to start another business
with you guys.

843
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,100
-Another business?
-Got a good idea?

844
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,185
Like what?

845
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,521
On Demo Day, we saw

846
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,440
that our algorithm can even work
on single-board computers.

847
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,942
That's right.

848
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,529
We worked very hard to make sure
it'd function well on this tiny phone…

849
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,114
So we drastically reduce the size
without realizing it.

850
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,702
If we managed to do it
with image recognition software,

851
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,497
maybe we can build a self-driving system.

852
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,832
Self-driving system?

853
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,292
That is complete nonsense, Ms. Seo.

854
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,336
It's hard even for big companies

855
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,588
that can pour a ton of money into R&D.

856
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,804
We have money too. That three billion won.

857
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,983
Then tell us your idea.

858
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,734
If it sounds feasible,

859
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,903
I'll give up the resort and join you.

860
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,738
-Me too.
-Same here.

861
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,960
You know, I am the CEO of an AI company.

862
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,462
I've been reading up
on self-driving cars and systems.

863
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,049
I'll list some of the basic equipment
that's absolutely necessary.

864
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:51,178
A GPS device, a camera, a LiDAR system,

865
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,056
front and rear radar receivers,

866
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,018
and an ultrasonic sensor.

867
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,520
On top of that,
you'd need a full computer system,

868
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,273
and the camera would need
the image recognition system.

869
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,650
You need a ton of equipment,

870
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,445
but if the solution doesn't take up
much space like our app,

871
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,280
I think it'd be doable.

872
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,987
The chart is very well organized.

873
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,489
Make sure there are no typos.

874
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,948
Good morning.

875
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,201
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

876
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,119
Mr. Han, how are you feeling?

877
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,913
I was really going to visit you.

878
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,084
Hey, did you tell Ms. Seo
that I wasn't feeling well?

879
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,171
I shouldn't have, right? I'm sorry.

880
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,050
Well, I don't mind
you being a blabbermouth.

881
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,010
What?

882
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,471
Really? Then can I tell you something?

883
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,474
What is it?

884
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:27,353
Samsan Tech is signing an acquisition deal
with 2STO today.

885
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,358
-Did you say "acquisition"?
-That's right.

886
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,486
-Acquisition, not an investment?
-Yes, you heard me right.

887
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,170
Where is Ms. Seo?

888
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,589
She went to 2STO's office with Do-san

889
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,674
to sign the deal.

890
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,260
What's going on?

891
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,303
-Do you have a copy of the agreement?
-Yes.

892
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:04,306
I went over it, and it looked fine to me.

893
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,432
Let me see.

894
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,451
You're early.

895
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,748
Did you have good dreams?

896
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,503
No, I couldn't sleep a wink last night
because of this important deal.

897
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,715
You'll sleep very well after this.

898
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,633
Shall we begin?

899
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,969
-Yes.
-Yes.

900
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,141
SAMSAN TECH

901
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,524
Why do you look so worried?

902
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,526
Is there a problem or something?

903
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,487
-No, there isn't.
-Then what's wrong?

904
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:01,864
That is the problem.

905
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,200
-We must stop their meeting.
-What?

906
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,452
QUESTION BOMBER

907
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,500
Why stop them if there are no problems?

908
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,378
Why would they pay three billion
for an unprofitable start-up?

909
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,964
Here, no help is unconditional.

910
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,591
They must have an ulterior motive.

911
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,969
You'll ruin our future
based on your speculation alone?

912
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,722
What gives you the right
to jump to such conclusions?

913
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:29,350
-Hey, look.
-Is this what you did to my brother?

914
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,478
Did you tell him he wouldn't make it?

915
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:35,439
-Your brother?
-What are you talking about?

916
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,608
I'm not jumping to conclusions.

917
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,735
This is acqhiring.

918
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,278
"Acqhiring"?

919
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,947
ACQHIRE: ACQUIRING A START-UP
TO RECRUIT TALENT

920
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,323
Acq… What?

921
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,617
What is that?

922
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,245
They're not acquiring your company
for its value.

923
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,163
All they want is recruit your engineers.

924
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,214
The moment they sign the deal,

925
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,634
your team will be disbanded.

926
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,695
SEO DAL-MI

927
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,075
NAM DO-SAN

928
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:36,995
I can't help but be curious.

929
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,957
Who has our CEO's heart?

930
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,209
Our majority shareholder, Mr. Nam?

931
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,837
Or our mentor, Mr. Han?

932
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,133
I'm not sure.

933
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,136
How do I figure that out?

934
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,888
You really don't know?

935
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:59,268
No. I really can't figure it out.

936
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,438
And I'm more curious than anyone.

937
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,024
Who

938
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:08,986
has my heart?

939
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,283
You'll find out.

940
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,662
Keep observing them,
and you'll have one of those aha moments.

941
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,199
Oh, no.

942
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,577
My gosh.

943
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:52,089
The moment I first saw you,
my dream became clear.

944
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,675
You said you'd take the whole team.

945
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:55,634
Do-san.

946
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:59,054
Blame yourselves for not reviewing
the contract thoroughly.

947
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:01,807
-So just accept it.
-Did you have to say that?

948
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,227
You said he was talking bullshit.
Now, look what happened!

949
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,731
It might even be harder
than winning a lottery.

950
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,108
What happened?

951
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,193
Would you go if it were you?
Give up on NoonGil and the team?

952
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,861
I would. I'd definitely go.

953
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,072
You're not the Do-san from the letters.

954
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:22,828
