00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,073
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

2
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,324
Here.

3
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,998
Did you come here
because you have nowhere else to go?

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,170
-Are you sure everything is okay?
-How many times do I have to tell you?

5
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,089
I'm doing great. I couldn't ask for more.

6
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,301
I'm very healthy
with nine-percent body fat,

7
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,094
and I own an apartment and a car.

8
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,597
Last year my salary was 200 million,
plus 1.5 billion in bonuses.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,557
And I made even more on the side. Happy?

10
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,059
Are you married?

11
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,812
-Not yet.
-That's a problem.

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,439
-Why is that a problem?
-You're unmarried in your 30s.

13
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,943
-I'm too busy with work.
-Bullshit.

14
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,945
If you're busy, what are you doing here?

15
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,157
I thought

16
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,451
I should pay you back.

17
00:01:59,035 --> 00:01:59,869
What do you mean?

18
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,705
The money I ran away with.

19
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,334
If I pay you back with interest,

20
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,962
you'd be able to open

21
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,548
a small shop instead of this.

22
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,259
That was your money in the first place.
Don't bother.

23
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,219
Cut your nonsense and leave now.

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,595
Fine, I'll leave.

25
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,181
But

26
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,433
at least take this.

27
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,645
What is this?

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,690
-It's upside down.
-Okay.

29
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,150
It's my business card.

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,278
My phone number is here.
Call me when you need anything.

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,780
I can do anything for you.

32
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,407
I don't need anything.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,579
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

34
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,290
If you're doing well,
don't show up and make me jealous.

35
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,125
-But--
-Come if things are rough.

36
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,460
Right?

37
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,713
Yes.

38
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,425
So stay right here.

39
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
Don't go anywhere.

40
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,761
All right.

41
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,347
Go now.

42
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,852
-Can I take some corn dogs with me?
-Sure, do that.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,062
I'll take this, too.

44
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,273
-Bye.
-Please give me a call!

45
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,691
All right.

46
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,612
-This tastes amazing.
-It does?

47
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,863
-Yes!
-Okay!

48
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,992
MATH GENIUS NAM DO-SAN
CONQUERS OLYMPIAD

49
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,833
EPISODE 2

50
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,586
Gosh, I'm tired.

51
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,633
What's all that?

52
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,718
I'm going to find Do-san.

53
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,553
I'm taking him to the party.

54
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,014
WITH MOTHER PARK GEUM-JEONG

55
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,600
Grandma, Do-san's letters were written

56
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,603
in standard language.
I guess he lives in Seoul.

57
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,064
Forget it.

58
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,150
How are you going to find him
after all these years?

59
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,363
Just remember him

60
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,574
as an old friend and move on.

61
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,078
Why should I move on?
I only have good memories of him.

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,372
What if he disappoints you?

63
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,959
He might turn out to be a loser.
Who knows?

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,253
Or turn out to be awesome.

65
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,296
He might have lost interest in you.

66
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,550
Right?

67
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,514
Then I'll ask him to be with me
for just a day.

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,308
To keep me company while I meet In-jae.

69
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,104
We were pen pals for over a year.
That shouldn't be hard.

70
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,398
Dal-mi.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,277
I'm sure he's still
just as smart and competent.

72
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,321
In-jae won't be able to look down on him.

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,660
Is it so bad to lose to In-jae?

74
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,997
Yes, definitely.

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,833
Why? What's the big deal if you lose?

76
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,334
No, I can't lose to her!

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,383
Then it'll look like

78
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,136
I lost to her because I chose Dad.

79
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,143
I don't want her to think
I'm miserable and regret my choice.

80
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,853
I was…

81
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,110
happy to be with Dad.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,988
I was happy,

83
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,450
and I don't regret my choice at all.

84
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,997
In-jae should know that.

85
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,125
I can't convince her like this.

86
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,461
It's frustrating.

87
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,341
Dal-mi.

88
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
In-jae is going back to America.

89
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,724
It's just one day.

90
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,227
I want to pretend that I'm successful

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,230
and that I don't envy her.
Just for one day.

92
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,862
It's not like I'm trying to become
a millionaire or win the lottery.

93
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm just going to put on a little show
for one day, that's all.

94
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,080
Can't I? It's just for one day.

95
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,373
Grandma?

96
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,064
SENIOR MANAGER HAN JI-PYEONG

97
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,571
-Mr. Han, you have--
-Park Dong-cheon.

98
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,825
Perfect timing. What's this?

99
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,619
Oh, it's a business plan
that was sent to our company email.

100
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,287
Did you take a look? It's not bad.

101
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,289
Biggest in the market, and a reliable CEO.

102
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,208
They why would they send a cold email?

103
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,837
Shouldn't VCs be lining up
to have a meeting with them?

104
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,882
Have you checked their revisit rate?
Their conversion rate is lousy, too.

105
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,052
It's just another business
that will only do well in the beginning.

106
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,100
But there could be hidden gems. Who knows?

108
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,393
Like a pearl in the mud.

109
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,438
Let angel investors take care
of the pearls in the mud.

110
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,649
Does a national coach look for
talent in an amateur soccer club?

111
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,153
Right. But there are great players
in those soccer clubs, too.

112
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,697
Are you leaving?
What were you going to tell me?

113
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,949
Oh, right. You have a visitor.

114
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,492
A visitor?

115
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,078
Do I have a meeting today?

116
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,458
No. She doesn't have an appointment,
but she's so stubborn.

117
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,920
Dong-cheon, have I ever met anyone
without an appointment?

118
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,006
No, never.

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,887
But you've never given anybody
your business card either.

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,062
-Where is she?
-Outside.

121
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,689
-In the entrance?
-Yes.

122
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,654
Ms. Choi. What are you doing here?

123
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,656
Me? Oh…

124
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,452
I got some corn dogs for you.
Share this with your friends.

125
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,163
Oh, my. You came to give me this?

126
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:21,834
Well, actually…
I have a favor to ask, too.

127
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,544
What is it?

128
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,923
You said you could do
anything for me, right?

129
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,470
-You said you didn't want anything.
-I didn't, until yesterday.

130
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,598
What is it? I'm getting scared.

131
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,475
There's no need. It's very simple.

132
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,227
Can you find a person for me?

133
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,395
Of course. Who are you looking for?

134
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,314
Do you remember Nam Do-san?

135
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,815
Nam Do-san?

136
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,068
I do. Those letters.

137
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,362
I need you to find him.

138
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,615
What? Ms. Choi, we made him…

139
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,289
We made him up.
How can I possibly find him?

140
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,626
I know. Just make someone up.

141
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,802
Gosh, I can't believe this.

142
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,929
What was your granddaughter's name again?

143
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,389
It's Dal-mi.

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,100
-Seo Dal-mi.
-Dal-mi.

145
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,227
What was she thinking
when she told such lies?

146
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,604
Strictly speaking, she wasn't lying.

147
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,648
She believes that Do-san exists.

148
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,818
-But he doesn't.
-Well, technically he does.

149
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,404
-We saw him in the newspaper that day.
-The newspaper?

150
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,281
How about this name?

151
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,741
He looks smart, kind, and well-off.

152
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,535
Do-san? Nam Do-san?

153
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,620
He's pretty good-looking.

154
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,581
Okay. Let's use this name.

155
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,834
That boy from 15 years ago?

156
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,002
That'd be even harder.

157
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,589
That's why I came to you. If it was easy,
I would've already have found him.

158
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,509
Did you say her name is Dal-mi?
How old is she now?

159
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
Can't she just ask
one of her ex-boyfriends--

160
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,638
She's never had a boyfriend.

161
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,850
Never? Why not?

162
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,520
That boy, Do-san,
got in the way every time.

163
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,481
How? He doesn't even exist.

164
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,109
Apparently, it's possible.

165
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,616
Do you have time this Saturday?

166
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,492
Getting these tickets was really hard.

167
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,329
I don't. And I'll never have time.

168
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,958
Why did you say no?
You wanted to see that musical.

169
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,128
He's rude. He booked those tickets
without asking me first.

170
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,840
Think of Do-san. He was so careful
when he wrote to me for the first time.

171
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,385
Why would you bring up that boy now?

172
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,973
An Ok-yun and Hawaii Pistol
were having a moment there at the end.

173
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,601
That was the climax of the whole movie.
And that kiss?

174
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,727
ASSASSINATION

175
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,813
You call that a kiss? That?

176
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,148
When you kiss…

177
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,400
In the beginning,

178
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,654
you start out smoothly.

179
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,156
And you go…

180
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,576
Then it gets more and more intense,

181
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,788
and you finally become one.
It's fantastic.

182
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,998
Now that's a kiss. Am I wrong?

183
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,625
The movie is for ages 15 and up.

184
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,335
That's why they had to stop there.

185
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,670
I think we should also

186
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,505
stop here.

187
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,256
What?

188
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,175
He can't communicate.

189
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,386
Think of Do-san. He's always on my side.

190
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,765
Lord, you're putting me through this
to test my patience, right?

191
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,143
Okay, I'll put up with it.

192
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,941
Grandma, I can't see this guy anymore.

193
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,945
Love is always patient

194
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,823
Look at this.
He says we're a "batch made in haven."

195
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,616
It's "heaven," not "haven."

196
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,743
What's a "batch made in haven"?

197
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,413
And "batch?" Does he think
I'm a muffin or something?

198
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,330
Think of Do-san.

199
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,792
His spelling and grammar were flawless
even in elementary school, remember?

200
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,878
Love is always patient, patient

201
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,547
And patient again

202
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,513
Why did you lie to her for ten years
if you couldn't handle it?

203
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,015
I didn't expect her to believe this
for so long.

204
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,268
This is partly your fault, too!

205
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,313
You raised her standards
way too high with your letters.

206
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,023
She thinks most guys are lame now.

207
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,569
You don't remember?

208
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,195
You wrote those letters with me.

209
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,074
And you're the one who started all this.
I was only helping you.

210
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,784
Fine, it's all my fault.

211
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,455
The kid was all alone and had no friends.

212
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,833
I wanted to give her someone to talk to,
but apparently I shouldn't have.

213
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,126
I made a terrible mistake.

214
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,880
Why did you even say you'd pay me back?

215
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,925
Why did you say such a thing
and make me come all the way here?

216
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,386
Fine, I get it. Wait.

217
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,598
I'll look for him.

218
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,851
How much time do I have?

219
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,896
Not a lot. You have until this Friday.

220
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,314
That's five days.

221
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,732
What?

222
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,318
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,905
Five days?

224
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,202
ALARM

225
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,429
Damn! I got shampoo in my eyes!

226
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,840
OUT OF ORDER

227
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,096
Hello.

228
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,182
Yes, I'm on my way to
Jeonggok Branch as backup.

229
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,392
Okay.

230
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,692
Hello, Father.

231
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,153
I'll try to persuade her. Don't worry.

232
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,780
Okay.

233
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,345
Dal-mi, we have to run away.

234
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,598
-What's wrong?
-It's a war zone in there.

235
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,224
Why are there so many customers?

236
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,605
-There are foreigners, too.
-JKN announced a guerrilla concert.

237
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
These people are all going
to their concert.

238
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,026
Let's wait somewhere nearby

239
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,028
and come back when the concert starts.

240
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,155
By then, there will be fewer people.
Let's go.

241
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,283
Okay. This is my chance.

242
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,410
No. Don't tie your hair.

243
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,370
Please don't.

244
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,747
Let's go.

245
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,124
It's time to set a new sales record.

246
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,377
Are you Usain Bolt?
Why would you want a new record?

247
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,962
We'll be exhausted afterward.

248
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,381
Let's just slack off
a little, okay? Let's go.

249
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,177
You can slack off if you want.
But the new record will be mine.

250
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,054
Bring it on.

251
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,272
-Do you need a refill?
-Yes, please.

252
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,567
What do you think?

253
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,153
She hasn't seen her mom in a year,

254
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,490
but she's been looking at her phone
for the past 30 minutes.

255
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,533
Well…

256
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,327
My husband is the same.

257
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,788
He never looks up from his phone.

258
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,916
Like father, like daughter, I guess.

259
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,086
He's her stepfather,
but they act the exact same way.

260
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,463
I'm sick of it.

261
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,425
-Do you need a refill?
-Yes, please.

262
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,596
What do you think?

263
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:18,060
My mom stays at a hotel
when her place is just around the corner.

264
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,270
Many people spend their vacations
at hotels--

265
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,065
Do they stay at hotels
all year round like my mom?

266
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,192
Well…

267
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,695
I guess some of them do.

268
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,490
You're taking my side? Thanks.

269
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,960
-Please hurry up!
-Come on!

270
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,254
-I've been waiting for an hour!
-Excuse me!

271
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,798
-Where's my coffee?
-Just a second.

272
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,133
Please wait just a second.

273
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,553
I think these orders are mixed up.

274
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,721
What?

275
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,639
Were these drinks served?

276
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,307
-And the croque monsieur?
-No idea.

277
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,023
Please don't break down.

278
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,943
-What should we do?
-Dal-mi!

279
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,612
Please help us. This is hell.

280
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,613
Just a second.

281
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,119
I apologize for the delay.

282
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
How can I help you?

283
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,377
One at a time, please.

284
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,880
-Speak one at a time, please.
-I can't hear you.

285
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,340
-Just a second, please.
-Please take my order!

286
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,718
-Please wait.
-What's taking so long?

287
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,473
Can you please line up?

288
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,724
SELECT ALL

289
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,100
ARTIST JKN

290
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,655
I still remember your voice

291
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,283
And the way you look at me so clearly

292
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,913
But I can't see you again

293
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,750
I cry all day

294
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,961
Waiting for you…

295
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,299
I listen to JKN songs all the time.

296
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,301
Today, I'll go full-on fangirl

297
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,304
and put all their albums on repeat.

298
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,893
All right.

299
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,853
Please line up!

300
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,855
Everyone, please get in line.

301
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,440
How can I help you?

302
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,399
Where's the syrup?

303
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,735
It's on the counter behind you.

304
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,279
You forgot the whipped cream.

305
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,782
I apologize. Coming right up.

306
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,327
-What's the Wi-Fi password?
-It's coffee01. Thank you.

307
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,089
-Damn it. Hey!
-Gosh.

308
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,882
I told you to wash my tumbler.

309
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,427
Sir, we can't serve a disrespectful person
like you. Get out.

310
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,476
How can I help you?

311
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,274

Thanks.

314
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,092
You're unbelievable.

315
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,933

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,945
-Congratulations.
-Great job.

319
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,406
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

320
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,828
It's the highest daily sales ever!
Great job!

321
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,163
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

322
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,293
No one is ever going to break our record,

323
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,794
right, Dal-mi?

324
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,548
-What?
-No one will ever break

325
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,466
our record.

326
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,304
Of course not. No one is going to break

327
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,847
our record.

328
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,226
Let's get back to work.

329
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,185
-Okay.
-Okay.

330
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,400
Dal-mi.

331
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,526
Yes?

332
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,238
You're working so hard
it's making me anxious.

333
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,240
I'm going on maternity leave soon.

334
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,035
They won't want me back
if they don't miss me.

335
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,829
Come on.
I'm not half as competent as you are.

336
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,291
-Are you serious?
-I'm half-serious.

337
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,711
You did a great job, Ms. Seo.

338
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,380
Thank you.

339
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,343
-Who is he?
-He's the human resources manager.

340
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,681
Dal-mi, I bet you'll get
a permanent position this time.

341
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,810
I hope I do before Friday.

342
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,605
Friday? Why? What happens that day?

343
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,622
Aren't you tired of this?

344
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,125
How can you enjoy hotels so much?

345
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,504
I like it. I get to swim
and go to the spa every day.

346
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,090
Plus, I don't have to see that jerk.

347
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,094
You can only swim and go to the spa
because Father pays for it.

348
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,764
Didn't Father pay for everything
you're wearing right now?

349
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,308
"Father"?

350
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,728
How can you call him that
after he cheated on me?

351
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,065
You're my daughter,
but I don't understand you.

352
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,067
I don't understand you either.

353
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,236
You complain about Father
while living off him.

354
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,154
AFTERNOON TEA WITH MOTHER

355
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,782
You're right. It's all my fault.

356
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,911
To think that I left your dad
for that jerk.

357
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,838
Mom, do you have time this Friday?

358
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,008
My company is holding a networking party.

359
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,927
I have zero interest in what you do.

360
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,596
Dal-mi will be there.

361
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,686
Don't you want to know

362
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,939
how Dal-mi is doing?

363
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,034
When is it again?

364
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,453
This Friday.

365
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:14,059
ONLY FAMILIES, FRIENDS, AND FOOLS
INVEST IN NEW START-UPS

366
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,318
Park Dong-cheon, why are you still here?

367
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,946
I'm trying to be a human filter.

368
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:30,242
I won't be fooled by business plans
but base my judgements on data.

369
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,787
Find this guy.

370
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,959
"Mathematical Olympiad youngest winner."

371
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,336
This was 15 years ago? Who is this?

372
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,840
Don't ask me any questions. Just find him.

373
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,343
But I have nothing to go on.

374
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,346
He won some competition 15 years ago
and is called Nam Do-san?

375
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm not a private detective or anything.

376
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,517
I can hear you.

377
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,935
Okay.

378
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,730
Nam Do-san?

379
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,275
That sounds familiar.

380
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,651
NAM DO-SAN

381
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,236
INBOX
FROM NAM DO-SAN

382
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,907
What is it? You recognize that name?

383
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,953
Yes. He's been sending us
his business plans for months.

384
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,748
His business is still in the early stage,
but he probably doesn't know any better.

385
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,585
Both his background and business idea
are unimpressive.

386
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,794
Are you sure it's him?

387
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,006
Here, it says he was the youngest winner
of the Mathematical Olympiad.

388
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,799
-Do you have his number?
-Yes, here.

389
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,384
Nam Do-san's phone number.

390
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,510
Text it to me.

391
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,763
You'll visit him yourself? At this hour?

392
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,765
Yes. Text me his partners' numbers, too.

393
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,977
These guys aren't even good enough
to be in an amateur soccer club.

394
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,313
Mr. Han!

395
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,815
A COMPANION TO START-UPS

396
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,609
AN INVESTOR LIKE A SHERPA

397
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,708
When will the CODA results be out?

398
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,627
Forget it.

399
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,630
The other contestants are
the best in the world

400
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,548
when it comes to image recognition.

401
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,301
There's no way
newbies like us will win any prize.

402
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,928
It's impossible.

403
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,306
Do-san, what's your passport number?

404
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,100
Did you hear me? Do-san?

405
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,062
Boss! Do-san!

406
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,688
What are you doing?

407
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,199
Your passport number.

408
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,284
-What?
-Give me your passport number.

409
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,786
FATHER

410
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,831
-My passport number? What for?
-I'm booking flights for us.

411
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,875
It's the peak season right now.

412
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,168
What flights?

413
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,380
The CODA prizes will be handed out
in San Francisco.

414
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,216
CODA? Didn't you just say
newbies like us--

415
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,927
Yes, I told you to forget it. I know.

416
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,095
But think about it.

417
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,306
I'm talking about
a one-in-a-million chance here.

418
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,436
Let's say we do win a prize
but can't find any flights.

419
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,690
VCs from Google and Amazon
want to invest in our company,

420
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,109
but we're not there.

421
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,694
How awful.

422
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,822
We don't want such a tragedy
to happen, do we?

423
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,282
Passport number.

424
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,410
I'd say there's not even
a one-in-a-million chance.

425
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,089
-What?
-What?

426
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,302
Lights off!

427
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,720
Are they here?

428
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,472
SAMSAN TECH

429
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,904
-Do-san!
-Too late.

430
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,823
-Nam Do-san!
-Quiet.

431
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,283
Do-san!

432
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,701
Back, back.

433
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,785
Do-san!

434
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,330
You can't avoid me forever.

435
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,374
I know you're in there.
Open the door right now!

436
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,501
You punk.

437
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,503
I'll count to three.

438
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,547
One…

439
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,506
Two…

440
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,427
Honey, let's make sure
he's in there first.

441
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,054
Over there.

442
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,852
-My knees are killing me.
-Be quiet.

443
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,354
Go further back.

444
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,194
Hey, the flashlight!

445
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,451
Hey, go back even further. The flashlight!

446
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,375
Back!

447
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,548
He's not here. Let's wait at home.

448
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,427
Those punks.

449
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,807
Watch your step.

450
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,187
My knees are killing me.

451
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,899
My knees.

452
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,943
-Whose phone is it?
-Turn it off!

453
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,860
It's mine.

454
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,159
I turned it off.

455
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,870
-Gosh.
-Who is it now?

456
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,997
Whose phone is it?

457
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,088
Oh, my.

458
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,885
It's cold.

459
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,234
They won't pick up. Nam Do-san,
Lee Chul-san, Kim Yong-san, none of them.

460
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,903
Wait.

461
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:03,074
Is their company called Samsan Tech
because they all have San in their names?

462
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,786
What a lame name.

463
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:13,042
Text me their company address.
I'll have to go there and see.

464
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,928
SAMSAN TECH

465
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,642
You're wearing the same shirts.

466
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,354
No, they're different colors.

467
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,192
Guys, I just realized that
our shirts are the RGB colors.

468
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,360
RGB?

469
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,114
RGB means
the three primary colors of light.

470
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,867
Red, green,

471
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,160
-and---
-I know that.

472
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:54,584
Anyway, Samsam Tech--

473
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,461
It's Samsan Tech, honey.

474
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,383
It's been exactly a year
since we invested in Samsan Tech.

475
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,718
You promised

476
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,056
you'd achieve great results within a year.

477
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,057
As an investor,

478
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,644
I came here to find out

479
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,396
if the money I invested is
being used properly

480
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,982
and what you have achieved so far.

481
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,320
First of all,
we've been using your investment

482
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,115
to cover the rent and the server cost.

483
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,494
We also bought some equipment.

484
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,623
We're spending every penny wisely
and we're grateful for your investment.

485
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,708
That's right. We often skip meals.

486
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,963
I see some new things.

487
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,968
Instant coffee wasn't good enough?

488
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,597
As you may know, many developers
suffer from abdominal obesity.

489
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,352
We had to buy the machine
to drink low-calorie coffee.

490
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,980
That doesn't explain the syrup.

491
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:00,316
If you were worried about calories,
you should've ditched the syrup.

492
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,526
You're right.

493
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,611
Thanks for pointing that out.

494
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,447
We're sorry.
We've been disappointing you lately.

495
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,284
"Lately"? You've been
disappointing us for a while now.

496
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,997
Isn't it about time you
gave us some kind of assurance?

497
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,249
So explain.

498
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,794
Depending on your answer,
I'll either continue to invest

499
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,131
in your company or withdraw it.

500
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,994
This is too narrow.

501
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,292
-Hello, Ms. Choi.
-Well?

502
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,169
Are you looking for Nam Do-san?

503
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,421
Yes, I'm on my way to him right now.

504
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,341
Already? How did you find him?

505
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,176
My GPS found him.

506
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
Good Boy, you're incredible.

507
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,806
So what does he do?

508
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,266
He runs a start-up.

509
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,062
A start-up? Isn't that a good thing?
It's on the news all the time.

510
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,981
Well, at least his title sounds
pretty impressive.

511
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,358
That's great.

512
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,817
Don't worry and just wait.

513
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,444
I'll talk to him.

514
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,491
A start-up?

515
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,494
You are near your destination.

516
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,997
I'm near my destination?

517
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,458
This is a residential area.
He has an office here?

518
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,591
Mr. Nam, Ms. Park.

519
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,095
Do-san wanted to wait
until it's official, but…

520
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,638
-Yong-san.
-It's okay.

521
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,473
-No, don't.
-Come on.

522
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,516
Tell them.

523
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,102
Don't be surprised. We entered

524
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,396
the CODA competition!

525
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,734
CODA.

526
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,950
Well… CODA…

527
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,201
CODA…

528
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,870
It's a company that's super famous
around the globe.

529
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,248
And they hold AI competitions.

530
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,334
Think of it as the AI Olympics.

531
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,669
Why are you so quiet?

532
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,005
You explain to me. In detail.

533
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,093
Father, you've heard of AI, right?

534
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,763
Yes, it stands for avian influenza.

535
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,143
Well…

536
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,063
That's a different AI.

537
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,691
We're talking about
artificial intelligence.

538
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,360
We use AI for image recognition…

539
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,320
Explain so I can understand.

540
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,905
Look me in the eye.

541
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,742
Make it easier than this?

542
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,623
What do you think this is?

543
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,083
Toilet paper.

544
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,045
-Then what's this?
-Instant ramyeon.

545
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,254
Then…

546
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,506
what about this?

547
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,675
-A good-for-nothing?
-Ms. Park.

548
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,554
We make computers do what you just did.

549
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,098
It's called image recognition.

550
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,768
And?

551
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,312
-Show them.
-Show them.

552
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,984
Look at this, Father.

553
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,155
See what happens when I show
the toilet paper to this camera.

554
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,785
The computer recognizes it
as toilet paper, right?

555
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,287
Give that to me.

556
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,375
"Instant noodle"

557
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,086
for ramyeon.

558
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,463
"Clock."

559
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,885
Well… Impressive.

560
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,888
Many companies have
image recognition software,

561
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,224
but none of them are as accurate as ours.

562
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,351
It's all about accuracy

563
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,062
and speed.

564
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,979
Speed!

565
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,442
Why does it say "toilet"?

566
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,072
Goodness. Why am I a toilet?

567
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:20,326
That shouldn't be happening. Let me see.

568
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,706
-It's working again.
-Try again.

569
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,468
This must be an error.

570
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,470
Why…

571
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,264
What's wrong?

572
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:44,475
Oh, I know.

573
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,103
-This was a prototype.
-That's right.

574
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,063
We solved this error.

575
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,274
It's because of the light.

576
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,568
Look at this.

577
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,196
Your forehead reflects light
and shines like a toilet.

578
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,824
That's why it says "toilet."

579
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,742
Turn it off.

580
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,412
The official version doesn't…

581
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,663
Just turn it off!

582
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,549
You have arrived at your destination.

583
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,509
Route guidance will now be terminated.

584
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
I guess this is it.

585
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,515
Father!

586
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,226
-Father, stop!
-Come here!

587
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,186
What's going on?

588
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,979
-Why is he running?
-Stop right there!

589
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,981
-What's going on?
-Stop, you punk!

590
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,357
-Stop right there!
-Father!

591
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,818
Father, I'm sorry.

592
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,278
-No way.
-Hold on.

593
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,197
That's a prototype. The official--

594
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,408
Cut it out. Come here!

595
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,994
Gosh, I'm tired.

596
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:49,457
Honey, we can forget about
our 60th birthday party.

597
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,543
We can't introduce that good-for-nothing
as our son.

598
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,671
He's turning 30 soon,
but he doesn't have a proper job.

599
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,089
It can't be.

600
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,966
With my money,

601
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,303
he made some crappy machine
that calls his dad a toilet?

602
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,638
-Why…
-Machine…

603
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,224
-No way.
-Honey.

604
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,059
-This is not happening.
-Keep it down.

605
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,852
You'll wake everyone up.

606
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,022
I don't care!

607
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:17,443
Everyone, wake up! Before I die,

608
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,112
-Please calm down.
-I'll make sure

609
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,615
-my son comes to his senses.
-Please stop.

610
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,244
You brat. What are you going to do now?

611
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,329
My first son has no job

612
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,997
and runs a lousy business.

613
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,208
Who would want to marry you?

614
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,711
The Nam family will die out with you.

615
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,214
-Keep it down.
-The Nam family?

616
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,049
-Come here.
-No.

617
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,717
-Father!
-Is his last name Nam?

618
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,053
-Please, Father.
-Did he say "Nam"?

619
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,639
-Who parked the car here?
-Oh, my.

620
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,976
-Let go!
-Father.

621
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,561
You punk, I'll teach you a lesson.

622
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,397
-Come here!
-Honey!

623
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,316
Come here right now.

624
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,611
Where did he go? Where is he?

625
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,321
Where is he?

626
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,073
-You punk.
-Father, please.

627
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,867
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll pay for a car wash.

628
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,786
I'm really sorry.

629
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,830
Nam Do-san, you punk!

630
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,790
-Nam Do-san?
-You'll pay for a car wash?

631
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,501
This must be a dream. It has to be.

632
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,004
Let go of him!

00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,339

-He's terrible.

00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,179
-How does he look?
-A total mess.

637
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,181
But he runs a start-up.

638
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,435
I know that world well,

639
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,769
and he's hopeless.

640
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,189
Goodness,
I thought he'd have a terrific life.

641
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,276
He's still in his 20s.

642
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,487
Even the luckiest ones get lost
in their 20s.

644
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,867
Is your father

00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,619
really going to withdraw his investment?

646
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,832
Yes.

647
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,711
The rent can be covered by the deposit,

648
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,756
but what about the server cost
and maintenance fees?

649
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,759
I don't know what to do.

650
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
Should we work as delivery men?

651
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,804
How much can we get for that?

652
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,182
This is a rooftop apartment.

653
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,101
If we sell that, this place will be
an oven in the summer.

654
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,227
You're right.

655
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,355
We'll get investments before summer.

656
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,616
We'll switch back to instant coffee.

657
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,659
We'll use membrane keyboards instead.

658
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,621
No games until we get investments.

00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,904
there's almost no chance
of Dal-mi finding Nam Do-san.

662
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,075
I thought you could find anyone
on Instagram,

663
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,661

664
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,912

I only managed to find him
because I'm capable and lucky.

No one else could ever find him.

709
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,746
She should eat well.

710
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,415
I see. That's great.

711
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,084
All right.

712
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,004
-It must be hard for her.
-Dal-mi

713
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,340
is apparently just as capable
and lucky as you.

714
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,841
Sure. What?

715
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,427
She found Nam Do-san.

716
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,722
-What?
-She's meeting him later.

717
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,602
Lord.

718
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,521
When? Where?

719
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,940
How did she find him?

720
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,024
How would I know?

721
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
My goodness.

722
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,737
Gosh, you startled me.

723
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,283
TO NAM DO-SAN

724
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,537
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

725
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,999
eight, nine, ten.

726
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,459
At this rate, we'll make

727
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,754
enough money to cover the server cost
and maintenance fees by tonight.

728
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,882
-Is the buyer picking it up in person?
-Yes, the Park Chan-ho ball.

729
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,970
"Seo Dal-mi"? She told you her name?

730
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,266
Yes. We've never met,
but she sounds way too friendly.

731
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,184
"I'm Seo Dal-mi.

732
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,062
I've missed you so much.
Let's meet up right now."

733
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,772
Are you sure you don't know her?

734
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,025
-We've never met.
-She says she missed you.

735
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:31,942
Why so emotional?

736
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,030
She must be a huge fan of Park Chan-ho's.

737
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,198
I don't think that's what it is.
Seo Dal-mi…

738
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,869
Seo Dal-mi… I've heard that name before.

739
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,079
Look! Sand Box!

740
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,768
THE DREAM PLACE

741
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,943
LOOKING FOR NEW MEMBERS

742
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,737
A PLACE WHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

743
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,533
It looks fantastic.

744
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:26,664
Guys, they even let you
bring your dog to work.

745
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,083
-That sounds amazing.
-Here,

746
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,794
you wouldn't have to worry
about your rent or server cost.

747
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:32,920
Exactly.

748
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,048
A PLACE WHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

749
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,246
I'm here. I'm wearing a blue jacket.

750
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,455
Are you on your way?

751
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,587
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

752
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,632
Why does he sound so dry?

753
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,635
Is it because it's been so long?

754
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,870
She's wearing a blue jacket.

755
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,329
-She is?
-Yes.

756
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,252
-Do-san.
-Yes?

757
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,130
Let's split up here.

758
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,133
-Why? Come with me.
-This is too inefficient.

759
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,595
All right. Let's split up
and increase efficiency.

760
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,764
Can't you take a hint?
Chul-san, you come with me.

761
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,224
Good luck!

762
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,310
What do you mean, "take a hint"?

763
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,312
I'm not stupid!

764
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,521
Follow me.

765
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,883
What are you doing?

766
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,764
Hold on. Gosh.

767
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,434
What's with you? Who are you?

768
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,477
The companion?

769
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,980
Wait.

770
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,149
A COMPANION TO START-UPS

771
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,694
The companion… Gosh!

772
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,071
You're the companion!

773
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,782
Mr. Nam Do-san, right?
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Ji-pyeong.

774
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,576
SH Venture Capital, right?

775
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,204
I wasn't in my right mind when I sent you
those emails, but you came to see me?

776
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,332
Well, kind of. Can we talk for a minute?

777
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,043
Of course.
We can talk all day if you want.

778
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,212
Gosh, unbelievable.
I didn't know this day would come.

779
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,673
How about we talk
at a café or your office?

780
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,719
Let's… Let's go to our office then.

781
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,013
I'll show you our demo, too.

782
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,058
Now I see why they call you
an angel investor.

783
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,101
You are an angel.

784
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,897
Mr. Nam, I'm not here to--

785
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,650
But before that,
can you give me five minutes?

786
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,985
I have to meet someone real quick.

787
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,986
Just five minutes.

788
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,614
You're meeting Seo Dal-mi, right?

789
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,823
Yes.

790
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,286
-How do you know that?
-I'll explain in my car.

791
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,538
Wait. I just need to hand this over.

792
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,707
-I just need to…
-I know.

793
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,585
-I just need to give her this ball.
-It'll be fine.

794
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,632
It's been 30 seconds.

795
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,647
I just need five minutes.
I just need to hand this over.

796
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,858
There are letters in the
glove compartment. Can you take them out?

797
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,069
-The glove compartment?
-The glove…

798
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,571
-Not that. It's here.
-Oh, okay.

799
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,455
It's nothing weird.

800
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,468
"Nam Do-san"? We have the same name.

801
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,845
FROM SEO DAL-MI
TO NAM DO-SAN

802
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,887
"Seo Dal-mi"?

803
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,390
What is this?

804
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,309
It's a long story.

805
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,604
Yes, Nam Do-san is your name.
And Seo Dal-mi is

806
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,774
the name of the girl
you were about to meet.

807
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,901
I've never received these letters.

808
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,320
I'd never even spoken to Seo Dal-mi
until today.

809
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,365
I know. Why don't you start
reading the letters first?

810
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,839
I'm sorry. Something came up,
and I can't make it.

811
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,846
The human resources manager
wants to see you.

812
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,055
Why?

813
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,808
Finally.

814
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,894
You're going to become
a full-time employee!

815
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,397
No way. I'm not getting my hopes up.

816
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,317
-I know you are.
-Go see him.

817
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,864
You want me to quit?

818
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,616
HUMAN RESOURCES

819
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,075
Don't take this the wrong way.

820
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,662
It's just that we don't want to lose
a talent like you.

821
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,082
To renew your contract,
we need you to take a break first.

822
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,960
You could make me
a permanent employee right away.

823
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,796
That's not possible.

824
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,631
That requires certain qualifications.

825
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,967
You didn't even go to university.

826
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,470
Two years ago, you said

827
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,473
I'd be given a permanent position
if I prove myself.

828
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,184
That's just what we say.

829
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,229
You're lucky to even have
your contract renewed.

830
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,232
Learn a bit more from your colleagues--

831
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,900
And then?

832
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,738
Then you'll become
more experienced and competent.

833
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,200
And then?

834
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,245
Wouldn't that be great?

835
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,334
All right. You'll quit next week
and come back in a month.

836
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,297
Good. Oh, I almost forgot.

837
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,343
This is a reward for achieving
a daily sales of ten million won.

838
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,804
Go with Seo-hyeon.

839
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,391
LUCCA THE PASTA GIFT VOUCHER

840
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,313
Thank you.

841
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,984
Are you okay?

842
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,779
Yes, of course.

843
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,031
Okay. That's great.

844
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,200
In two years,

845
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,579
I'll make sure you get
a permanent position.

846
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,581
Do you trust me?

847
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,750
Yes.

848
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:55,005
Do you expect me to be fooled twice?
No, you little…

849
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,760
YOU QUIT!

850
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,731
You're coming tomorrow, right?

851
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,817
Mom's coming, too. She misses you a lot.

852
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,904
She misses me now?

853
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,081
So a girl named Seo Dal-mi
has had a crush on Do-san

854
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,626
for the past 15 years?

855
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,794
She believes the feelings are mutual.

856
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:39,174
That man has been writing to her,
pretending to be Do-san.

857
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,258
It's impersonation.

858
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,636
-What does he want?
-He wants Do-san

859
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,889
to meet Dal-mi here,

860
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,724
-looking like a hotshot.
-A hotshot?

861
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,187
-Can he do that?
-Of course not.

862
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:01,446
So you didn't come to talk
about investing in our company then.

863
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,824
I'm sorry. I know it sounds ridiculous.

864
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,370
But I'm deeply indebted to the person
who asked this favor.

865
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:13,124
It's just for an hour. Please pretend
to be the person in the letters.

866
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,128
Well…

867
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,592
Well, let's make a deal.

868
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,095
It's all about give and take,
don't you think?

869
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,682
Tell us what you can do for us first.

870
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,308
Don't make it sound complicated.

871
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,269
-Nothing is free.
-There will be a reward.

872
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,397
How much do you want?

873
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:38,900
Have you…

874
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,654
had a chance to look at our business plan?

875
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,241
Well, yes.

876
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,744
Are you interested in investing?

877
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,334
Your business is still in the
early stage for us to invest.

878
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,672
What does that mean? We're too early?

879
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,634
He thinks it's too early
to invest in our company.

880
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,429
So he means
we're in different weight classes.

881
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,433
Is it because it's too early

882
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,562
or because we have no potential?

883
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,604
Look.

884
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,190
I'm not here as an investor.

885
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm here to ask a favor,
and I'm going to reward you.

886
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,611
How much do you want?

887
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,114
You say it only takes an hour,

888
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,451
but he'll have to spend all day
getting ready and everything.

889
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,411
Do-san is worth a lot.

890
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,204
You'll have to pay him at least…

891
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,208
-Two…
-Two million won?

892
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,048
-Unbelievable.
-Two million?

893
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,216
We'll have to think about it.

894
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,927
We'll discuss this outside.

895
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,596
Guys, follow me.

896
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,223
Make yourself comfortable.

897
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,198
Gather around.

898
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,826
Is it just me
or do we have the high ground?

899
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,746
-The high what?
-The high ground!

900
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,456
-Come on.
-I get it now.

901
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,209
How can he offer
two million won so easily?

902
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,585
And it's just for an hour!

903
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,045
Guys, look at this.

904
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,714
He's supposed to be the best VC there is.

905
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,885
A bonus of 1.5 billion won?
He must be extremely competent.

906
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,221
Guys, how about we step up our game?

907
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,263
Let's do that.

908
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,724
We have nothing to lose. Let's go big.

909
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,101
-Me?
-You.

910
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,316
SAMSAN TECH

911
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,359
Can he pull it off?

912
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,027
He must.

913
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,196
The future of our company is on the line.

914
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,326
What did Nam Do-san say? Did he say yes?

915
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,080
Even if he says yes, it's still a problem.
I'm not sure if he can help Dal-mi.

916
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,332
PAYMENT REMINDER

917
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:02,293
He's clueless and hopeless.

918
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,255
Is it that bad? My goodness.

919
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,466
Don't worry.
If I lend him my suit and car,

920
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,052
he might be able to fool people
for a while.

921
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,890
He looks like a nice guy. Easy to handle.

922
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,308
Just like you, Good Boy.

923
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,685
Seriously.

924
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,606
I'll call you back. Bye.

925
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,155
-Have you made up your mind?
-Yes.

926
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,323
I'll do my best.

927
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,618
Thank you. I appreciate it.

928
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,581
But we'd like a bigger reward.

929
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,792
You want more money?

930
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:43,918
-That's right.
-Yes.

931
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:44,961
No.

932
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,337
-No?
-No?

933
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,465
We don't need any money. Instead,

934
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,260
please let Samsan Tech enter Sand Box.

935
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,348
Then I'll do as you say.

936
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,521
I can't do that just because you ask me.

937
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,483
Sand Box has high standards.

938
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,443
You don't have to change the standards.

939
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,613
Change us. In this interview, you said

940
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,908
"The Sherpa people serve as guides
in the Himalayas."

941
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,284
Please stop.

942
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,454
"I want to be an investor like a Sherpa.

943
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,539
-A companion--"
-I never said that.

944
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,501
-The journalist--
-"…who guides and protects

945
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,669
-entrepreneurs--"
-I'm not a companion!

946
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,131
All those words were made up
by the journalist!

947
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,717
I don't even know what a Sherpa is!

948
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,352
Let me just pay you.

949
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,562
Here.

950
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,981
I know you need money.

951
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,073
We want to enter Sand Box.

952
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,409
We don't need money.

953
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,554
Too bad.

954
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,056
Sand Box is beyond my ability.

955
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,561
Are you leaving?

956
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,562
Yes. I'm sorry.

957
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,444
You asked if I was interested
in investing.

958
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,785
I've looked into
about a thousand start-ups so far

959
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,829
and invested in a little over 30.

960
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,374
Four of them didn't get
any follow-up investments.

961
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,001
That's not a high batting average.

962
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,461
I know. It's nothing impressive.

963
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,964
Among the start-ups
that I didn't invest in,

964
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,551
zero succeeded.

965
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,678
None of them.

966
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,474
I don't want to lose the latter record.

967
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,438
That's why I am never

968
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,481
going to invest in your company.

969
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,068
It's not because it's early.

970
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,996
That bastard!

971
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,957
Why does he sound so convincing
while saying we have no chance?

972
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,377
Right, it was very convincing.

973
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,974
It's just his opinion, not a fact.

974
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:50,521
NEVER LET SOMEONE'S OPINION

Yeong-sil, turn on the lights.

978
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,399
Sure, what song do you want to listen to?

979
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,154
Nothing seems to go my way.

980
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,782
What song do you want?

981
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:49,080
I guess I won't be able to keep
the promise I made to Ms. Choi.

982
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,710
It really pisses me off.

983
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,171
-So play a song--
-Because you didn't answer, I picked one.

984
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,923
I hope you like it.

985
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,050
Screw you

986
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,055
Screw you

987
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,268
What a fantastic choice of song.

988
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,478
I'm perfectly fine

989
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,565
-Just kill me now.
-So why can't I get one?

990
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,608
You're just going through a rough patch.

991
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,069
Do you want me to find
a suicide prevention center?

992
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,239
The weather is so nice

993
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,994
-You're making me laugh.
-So why do I have a cold?

994
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,373
Hey, you're growing on me.

995
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,548
This is a good song.

996
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,152
No, I'm renting it.

997
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,404
-Lucky you.
-It's still a nice apartment.

998
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,573
She's getting up. Sit.

999
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,369
How are ETFs doing these days?

1000
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,330
Are they better than stocks?

-Do you have any stocks?
-Lucky you.

1005
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,858
-I'll buy a car this year.
-I'm doing the opposite of what you do.

1006
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,695
-That's a good idea.
-You should try stocks, too.

Oh, my.

1013
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,048
Did you try the suit on?

1014
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,967
I thought it looked so elegant.

1015
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,595
How much was it? It looked expensive.

1016
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,222
It wasn't that expensive.

1017
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,891
I have a lot of money.

1018
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,061

-Yes.
-But you couldn't find Do-san.

1022
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,831
Instead, I'll show up looking fabulous
in that elegant suit.

1024
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,046
What?

1025
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,383
You're a cosmos flower.

1026
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,055
And it's still spring.

1027
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,308
Wait until fall,

1028
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,436
and you'll bloom beautifully.

01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:20,281
Okay.

1031
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:36,964
Dad got me a beautiful music box
for my ninth birthday.

1032
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:42,845
He said I could hear a beautiful melody
if I opened it.

1033
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:17,838
But I never opened it.

1034
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,465
Isn't that funny?

1035
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,554
What if I opened the pretty music box

1036
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,223
and…

1037
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,703
I didn't like the melody?

1038
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,581
What if it doesn't play any melody at all?

1039
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,751
Because of stupid worries like that…

I never opened it.

Are you wondering
why I'm telling you this?

1043
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,141
What I'm trying to say is…

1044
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:18,399
Do-san, you're my pretty music box.

1045
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,610
It doesn't matter if you never open.

I'M MEETING MY SISTER TODAY.
CAN YOU COME?

1047
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:28,075
It was enough for me to know
that you were there.

1048
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,786
I hope you know that.

1049
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,084
Do you guys have

1050
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,338
a suit I can borrow?

1051
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:39,646
I bet you have a lovely melody.

1052
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,607
I'm sure of it.

1053
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,207
You've comforted me all these years,

1054
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,709
and you always will.

1055
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:49,693
I'm sorry.

-Hello.

01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,007
-Nicole!
-In-jae.

1058
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:15,511
Will I see you before I leave for the US?

1059
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,889
-Yes, when do you go to San Francisco?
-Next Tuesday.

1060
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:20,224
Oh, it's soon.

1061
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,770
How is your…

1062
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,356
Oh, it's fine. And you?

1063
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,233
-I'm fine.
-Fine? Good.

1064
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,739
Good evening.

1065
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:36,782
Hello. How are you?

1066
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,618
-Mr. Han.
-Hello.

1067
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,827
You look great.

1068
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,632
Is she ashamed of something?
Why is she hiding?

1069
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,065
Have you been waiting long?

1070
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:18,568
Yes,

1071
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,239
very long.

1072
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:26,326
I missed you.

1073
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,665
But think about it.

1074
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,668
I'm talking about
a one-in-a-million chance here.

1075
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,174
Let's say we do win a prize…

1076
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,959
…but can't find any flights.

1077
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,381
VCs from Google and Amazon…

1078
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,389
…want to invest in our company
but we're not there.

1079
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:36,057
How awful.

1080
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:39,436
We don't want such a tragedy
to happen, do we?

1081
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,236
Nam Do-san.

1082
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,197
I can't wait to meet this guy.

1083
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:07,255
I'm curious.
I want to know everything about you.

1084
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,759
Thank you. I've never received
a text from a girl before.

1085
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,180
-Why is this opening?
-Seems like they're having fun.

1086
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,682
I'm headed to the address
on the business card.

1087
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,060
I'm following in your footsteps.

1088
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:21,394
I quit my job.

1089
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,439
If the start is easy then
it'll be taken away easily as well.

1090
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:26,274
It's all about potential.

1091
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,276
Only 40 people will become a CEO.

1092
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,987
-Why is he…
-I'm sorry I deceived you, Dal-mi.

1093
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,409
