EPISODE 1

2
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,501
Yeong-sil, what's my schedule today?

3
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,215
You have a start-up relay lecture
at 2 p.m.

4
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,885
It's at Sand Box.

5
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,304
What's the weather like today?

6
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,931
Here's your fortune for today.

7
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,438
Today, the god of fate

8
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,900
will send a gentle breeze
into your peaceful life.

9
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,862
What the hell? Yeong-sil, the weather,
not my fortune! The weather!

10
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,655
You may run into someone

11
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,450
you met briefly in the past,
at an unexpected place.

12
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,960
#JUST LANDED #MEANINGFUL TIME

13
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,919
Be careful.

14
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,464
The person may seem
like a spring breeze at first

15
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,593
but may turn into a strong winter wind

16
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,348
and change your life completely.

17
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,599
To the office?

18
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
Hello, Mr. Han.

19
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,837
Hey, is the AI speaker,

20
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,798
Jang Yeong-sil, included
in today's investment evaluation?

21
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,426
-Yes. Jiphyeonjeon Tech, right?
-Exclude it.

22
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,177
It doesn't understand a word I say.

23
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,721
Really?

24
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,682
It has excellent multilingual support.

25
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,933
"Excellent"?

26
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,102
Hey, it's complete garbage.

27
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,688
When I asked about the weather,
it told me my fortune.

28
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,606
What a disgrace to our ancestors.

29
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,359
It doesn't deserve to be called
Jang Yeong-sil.

30
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,030
Anyway, don't include it.

31
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,494
Hello? Mr. Han? Han Ji-pyeong!

32
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,043
I wonder what Yeong-sil said

33
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
to make him so angry.

34
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,889
START-UP RELAY LECTURE

START-UP RELAY LECTURE

37
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,214
I have a question for Ms. Won In-jae.

38
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,049
Sure. What's your name?

39
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,550
My name is Kim Yong-san.

40
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,845
Did you read the comments
under your article today?

41
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,309
What's with you?

42
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,856
Of course, I did.

43
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,193
I'll probably live very long.
So many people hate me.

44
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,908
Many say your success is
only thanks to your rich father

45
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,828
and doesn't count
because you didn't start at Sand Box.

46
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,870
Any thoughts?

47
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,498
Because I didn't start at Sand Box?

48
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,667
Ms. Yoon.

49
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,086
Why is this place called Sand Box again?

50
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,551
You've all seen sandboxes at playgrounds.

51
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,805
They prevent children
from getting hurt, right?

52
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,181
That's where it comes from.

53
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,227
We want to protect entrepreneurs
from getting hurt even if they fall.

54
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,732
Exactly. This place is for people
who can get hurt by failing.

55
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,069
If a person like me,
who has a rich father, enters Sand Box,

56
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,946
wouldn't that be shameless?

57
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,409
Speaking of hateful comments,

58
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,619
I couldn't care less.

59
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,873
They say the best revenge

60
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
for those scumbags is indifference.

61
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,380
That's why I stopped caring about them.
It's my revenge.

62
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,715
Can we move on now?

63
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,426
Yes.

64
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
Did she just call me a scumbag?

65
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,891
She sure did. Why are you even asking me?

66
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,976
-Gosh.
-Any more questions?

67
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,020
-I have a question!
-Me!

68
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,438
The guy in the plaid shirt.

69
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,856
Yes, go ahead.

70
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,320
Hello, my name is Lee Seong-hun,
and I'm planning a business.

71
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,947
Hello.

72
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,283
My name is Seo Dal-mi.

73
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:22,877
Seo Dal-mi?

74
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,297
What's wrong? Do you know her?

75
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,215
What?

76
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,300
No.

77
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,265
Okay. Please go ahead.

78
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,936
I see you've made
some very smart decisions in your life.

79
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,772
But please be honest.

80
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,901
Have you made any selfish decisions
so far, Ms. Seo In-jae?

81
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,363
What's with her?

82
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,157
Seo In-jae? Isn't her name Won In-jae?

83
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,408
Why change her last name?

84
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,744
-Is she a hater?
-Do they know each other?

85
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,752
Yes, of course. I'm only human, after all.

86
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,757
You may call my decision greedy,
but it was a desperate one.

87
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,634
But Ms. Seo,

88
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,136
my name is…

89
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,060
Won In-jae.

90
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,407
1. TO START

91
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,243
2. A NEW BUSINESS
WITH INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND IDEAS

94
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,211
15 YEARS AGO

95
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,172
Seo Dal-mi. Stop playing DDR.

96
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,133
You'll get holes in all your socks.

97
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,769
Let's play together, In-jae.
It's much more fun that way.

98
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,731
I like Pump better than DDR.

99
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,984
Really? Then I'll play Pump
starting today.

100
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,615
Why are you writing
letters of resignation every day?

101
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,617
A-hyeon, listen to me.

102
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,952
I have this killer business idea.

103
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,704
It'll starve us all to death.

104
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,334
In-jae, should we try to stop them?

105
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,297
I've been working like a dog
for other people for the last 20 years.

106
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,050
Now I want to work for myself.

107
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,721
When a dog runs off,
it only becomes a stray dog.

108
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,932
And then what happens?
It either freezes or starves to death.

109
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,102
I won't let my daughters starve to death.

110
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,228
So…

111
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,402
If you want to quit your job,
quit this family first.

112
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,700
-A-hyeon.
-Take it.

113
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,702
Take it!

114
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,751
SEO IN-JAE

115
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,883
Grandma, you should tell Dad
to change his mind.

116
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,676
He'll listen to you.

117
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,678
If you talk to him…

118
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,640
If he listened to me,
he wouldn't have married your mom.

119
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,975
Here.

120
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,648
Then how about you come live with us?

121
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,234
Forget it.
They'll fight even more if I'm there.

122
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh, right.

123
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,450
Those boys wanted me to give you
this letter. What should I do with it?

124
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,036
Come on. Why would you give it to her now?

125
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,539
What am I supposed to do then?

126
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,082
Those ungrateful brats.

127
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,208
Lucky you.

128
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,130
Throw it away. Don't they ever get tired?

129
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,507
If they studied this hard,
they'd win a prize.

130
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,883
-She turned you down.
-It's fine.

131
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,718
Hey, she's not interested.

132
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,181
-There are a ton of other girls.
-I'll find you another girl.

133
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
My goodness.

134
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,315
What can I get you?

135
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,942
HAN JI-PYEONG

136
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,235
I'm not hungry.

137
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,079
-Grandma, I'm going to school.
-Okay.

138
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,831
-See you, Grandma!
-Bye.

139
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,210
What is it?

140
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,716
In-jae, can't we take the next bus?

141
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,342
No. We have to follow Dad.

142
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,344
Dad? Why are we following Dad?

143
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,889
If Dad quits his job,
Mom will get a divorce.

144
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,475
We have to stop him.
Do you want us to split up?

145
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,768
-No.
-Let's go.

ILCHEUNG CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING

147
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,096
What?

148
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,518
I pay you guys

149
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,730
tens of millions of won every year.

150
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,483
How dare you go behind my back like this?

151
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,818
Who pays you?

152
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,696
Me, or the branch managers?

153
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
Sir, please calm down.

154
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,246
You stay out of this.

155
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,334
Was it you? Did you gang up
with the branch managers

156
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,044
and exaggerate the sales?

157
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,505
While getting paid by me?

158
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,007
-Dad.
-You stabbed me in the back.

159
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,426
How dare you?

160
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,347
Sue me if you want.

161
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,683
No, I can pay you a settlement
right here and now.

162
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,476
How much do you want?

163
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,896
Answer me! How much do you want?

164
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,398
How much?

165
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,201
Dad got beaten up?

166
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,497
Yes. Why don't we just let him start

167
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,332
his own business?

168
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,295
We should. I feel sorry for him. Please.

169
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,922
-How much is he getting paid?
-What?

170
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,507
His boss mentioned a settlement.

171
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,134
So how much?

172
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,469
About ten million won?

173
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,598
Mom, is money what's important right now?

174
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,767
Yes, money is important

175
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,603
whether you like it or not.

176
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,230
If your dad quits his job,
what about your tuition?

177
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,816
In-jae, you won't be able to
go to cram school anymore.

178
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,777
Will you study on your own
while your friends go to cram school?

179
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,030
Are you okay
if you can't go on school trips?

180
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,953
For your future,

181
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,998
your dad has to make money no matter what.

182
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,292
That's his duty.

183
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,508
Dad.

184
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,139
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,020
Let's get divorced.

186
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,189
-Dad.
-Dad.

187
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,195
Okay, let's do that.

188
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,574
In-jae, Dal-mi,

189
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,160
who do you want to live with?

190
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,206
Me or Dad?

191
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,299
That decision…

192
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,594
Have you ever regretted it?

193
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,137
Have I regretted it?

194
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,807
I have. I mean, I'm only human.

195
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,102
That makes me wonder.

196
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:21,855
Is the person who made
the opposite choice happy now?

197
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,190
Do they have regrets?

198
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,610
They say, whatever choice you make,
you'll regret it.

199
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,195
There are exceptions.

200
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,616
Thank you for your honest answer,

201
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,701
Ms. Seo In…

202
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,495
I mean,

203
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
Ms. Won In-jae.

204
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,298
You may run into someone

205
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,510
you met briefly in the past,
at an unexpected place.

I'm not hungry.

211
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,501
Come on in.

212
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,129
Look around.

213
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,674
This used to be a boiler room.

214
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,760
It'll be as hot as a sauna in winter.

215
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,303
You'll never freeze to death.

216
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,388
But I'll die from heatstroke in summer.

217
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,142
-How much is the deposit?
-2 million. The rent is 150,000.

218
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,562
How much did you get

219
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,564
-when you left the orphanage?
-Two million.

220
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,191
"Two million…"

221
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,527
After paying the deposit, you won't have
any money left for rent.

222
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,695
Or for food.

223
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,906
Goodness. Let's go.

224
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,288
By the way, it says "Han Ji-pyeong" here.
Who's that?

225
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,748
-Is that you?
-Yes.

226
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,502
Oh, my. A kid like you has these skills?

227
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,505
How many zeros is that? One, two, three…

228
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,466
You won a hundred million won as a prize?

229
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,718
With that money,
you can rent a better place.

230
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,386
-You could even--
-It's cybermoney.

231
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,596

00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,599

00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,310
Hey.

235
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,189
Hey, why don't you try investing for real?

236
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,526
With your skills, you could make
some real cash in no time.

237
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,612
I can't even open an account.
I'm not 19 yet.

238
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,698
Why not? My son has an account.

239
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,659
-Your parents--
-I don't have parents.

240
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,661
Right. Sorry.

241
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,664
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

242
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,415
Hang in there.

243
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,669
They say you should even pay for
hardships when you're young.

244
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,798
Then buy my hardships.

245
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,008

I see.

You have no place to sleep?

258
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,117
I do.

259
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,953
You can sleep at my shop.

260
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,288
It's closed between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.

261
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,790
I have a place to sleep.

262
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,169
There's even a heating pad on the floor.
It's as hot as a sauna all night.

263
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,380
Are you deaf?
I said, I have a place to sleep!

264
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,471
There's a birdhouse hanging
from that cherry blossom tree over there.

265
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,014
I'll put the keys in there.

268
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,549
He probably didn't come.

269
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,385
He said he had a place to sleep.

270
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,640
But where? He obviously had nowhere to go.

271
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,061
It's a good thing if he came back.
He needs that money more than I do.

272
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,354
I can always make more…

273
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,856
No, not after all that hard work!

274
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,238
My money. Where is it?

275
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,951
Lord, forgive me.

276
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,328
I doubted a person.

-Lord…
-Apologize to me, not to Lord.

278
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,499
Oh, my.

279
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,251
I did consider running away with it.

280
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,298
You should put that in a bank account.

00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,263

Can you take care of it for me?

291

Why would I? I have a place to go to.

292
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,428

324
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,697
Where's your sister?

325
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,240
She followed Mom.

326
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,452
Mom left with her.

327
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,502
Grandma.

328
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,302
It's okay.

329
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,388
What do I do now?

330
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,059
I'm still with you.

331
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,272
-It's okay.
-Grandma.

332
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,007
Is there something wrong?

333
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,096
Ji-pyeong,
your handwriting is really nice.

334
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,308
You saw my granddaughter earlier, right?

335
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,519
Her name is Dal-mi.

336
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,853
That's her name?

337
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,773
Her name is as old-fashioned as she looks.

338
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,233
Can you write a letter to her?

339
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,694
Say you've always wanted
to be friends with her.

340
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,656
Make it look like it was written
by a kid her age.

341
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,698
Why?

342
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,452
Her sister is her only friend,

343
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,871
but she's gone now.

344
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,500
I want to give her a new friend
even if it's a fake one.

345
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,545
If I write it,
she'll recognize my handwriting.

346
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,546
You should do it.

347
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,048
So why? Why should I?

348
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,092
-Because you're a good boy.
-Gosh.

349
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,677
Stop calling me that.

350
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,846
You're mistaken.

351
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,772
Should it be from a girl?

352
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,859
She'll know I'm a boy
once she sees my handwriting.

353
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,068
You think so?

354
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,112
Then should it be from a boy?

355
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,787
Start it like this.

356
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,206
"Dear Dal-mi."

357
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,334
"Dear Dal-mi"? Are you kidding me?

358
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,253
That's so old-fashioned.

359
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
I'll simply write,

360
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,343
"Hi, Dal-mi. My name is…"

361
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,389
-What should my name be?
-Make something up.

362
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:30,643
Something that will make her think
you're smart, kind, and well-off.

363
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,606
Should we use your real name?

364
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,191
Gosh, no way.

365
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,200
How about this name?

366
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,952
He looks smart, kind, and well-off.

367
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,872
Do-san? Nam Do-san?

368
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,208
He's pretty good-looking.

369
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,168
Okay. Let's use this name.

370
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,463
"My name is

371
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,882
Nam Do-san.

372
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:05,845
I want to be friends with you. That's why
I picked up a pen to write this letter."

373
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,764
But you're holding a pencil.

374
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm just joking.

375
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,771
"That's why I picked up a pen
to write this letter."

376
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,855
It's a pencil.

377
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,027
Do you really think this will work?

378
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,153
What?

379
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,072
I mean, think about it.

380
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,407
Her parents got divorced,

381
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,576
and her sister,
who's her best friend, is gone.

382
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,412
Do you think this can comfort her?

383
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,252
Dad!

384
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,088
Dad!

385
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,548
Come on.

386
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,843
I've been organizing these for hours.

387
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,719
Dad, I got a love letter.

388
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,223
What? A love letter?

389
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,391
Yes.

390
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,353
Isn't his handwriting amazing?
He's my age. His name is Nam Do-san.

391
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,480
Isn't that such a special name?

392
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,566
Special, my foot.

393
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,901
It sounds like a wrestler's name.

394
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,695
No. He's very good at math.

395
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,322
He must be a total genius.

396
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,451
Is the letter from the UK, by any chance?

397
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,036
Isn't it a chain letter?

398
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,539
It isn't. He gave the letter
to Grandma himself.

399
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,833
Listen.

400
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,299
"I hope this letter didn't surprise you
too much.

401
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,135
A few days ago…"

402
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,679
I said goodbye to my dog, Mongsil.

403
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,141
-I considered him my little brother.
-That's nice.

404
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,101
-Good job.
-I miss him like crazy.

405
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,604
-Yesterday,
-Mongsil…

406
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,731
-I cried a lot after seeing my shoe
-Yes.

407
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,733
-that Mongsil chewed on.
-That's good.

408
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,859
Isn't that funny?

409
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,404
It's not funny at all.
I feel the same way.

410
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,742
I thought he'd always be with me.

411
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,663
I took the time
we spent together for granted

412
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,625
when every moment was a gift.

413
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,085
I should have been nicer to him.

414
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,214
I regret everything these days.

415
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,093
But then I realized something.

416
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,470
Come on.

417
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,931
-The present moment is a gift, too.
-What is this?

418
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,308
-This is no good.
-I'll regret this moment as well.

419
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,811
-In winter, I'll miss the green of summer.
-That's very nice.

420
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,190
In the summer, I'll miss the white snow.

421
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,026
I've made up my mind

422
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,863
to stop filling my days with regrets.

423
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,076
That's why I worked up the courage
to write a letter to you.

424
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,828
I like you, Seo Dal-mi.

425
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,957
And I thank you

426
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:42,835
for filling my present moment

427
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,295
with excitement and happiness.

428
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,216
From Nam Do-san,
who wants to be your friend.

429
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,348
Are you sure he's your age?

430
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,850
He sounds extremely mature.

431
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,061
Times have changed, Dad.

432
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,771
All kids these days are mature.

433
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,648
Take me for example.

434
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,359
Your grandma gave this to you?

435
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,946
Yes. You know there's a
cherry blossom tree near her shop, right?

436
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,156
He wants me to leave my reply
in the birdhouse.

437
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,034
Isn't that so romantic?

438
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,536
But I don't understand.

439
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,582
Why doesn't he ask you to meet him?
If he likes you, he must want to meet you.

440
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,043
Maybe that was okay when you were young.

441
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,421
If you do that now,
people will call you a stalker.

442
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,507
I like this boy, Do-san. He's very gentle.

443
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,093
-Are you going to write him back?
-Well…

444
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,013
He sounds like a nice boy.

445
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,100
More than anything, he sounds like
he's head over heels for me.

446
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,395
I should probably be nice
and write him back.

447
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,742
Here. It's still hot.

448
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,951
-Thank you.
-See you.

449
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,703
-Thank you.
-Bye.

450
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,621
Enjoy. See you.

451
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,041
Hey! Go home and study now.

452
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,500
You've been playing too long.

453
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,669
What brings you here?

454
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,006
Here's Dal-mi's reply.

455
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,593
She already wrote a reply? My goodness.

456
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,056
Oh, right. Put this in the birdhouse.

457
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,891
That's what Nam Do-san said.

458
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,645
Thanks, Mom.

459
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,647
It really cheered up Dal-mi.

460
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,108
-You could tell it was me?
-Yes.

461
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,944
Only I could tell.

462
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,783
What about Dal-mi? Did she fall for it?

463
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,785
That's a relief.

464
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,581
-Mom.
-Yes?

465
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,167
I'll work really hard.

466
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,337
I'll bring back A-hyeon and In-jae.

467
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,339
I'll even buy you

468
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,300
a building.

469
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,011
You and your empty promises.

470
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,931
I hope you don't end up a liar.

471
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,768
I make promises first,
and then I do my best to keep them.

472
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,270
Give me just a year.

473
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,149
Just a year.

474
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,113
All right. Now, put this in there.

475
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,572
Go.

476
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,762
-Bye.
-Thank you.

You only wrote letters for a year?

Mom…

504
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,624
got married again.

505
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,087
What?

506
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,841
We're moving to the US today

507
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,677
because of my stepdad's work.

508
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,888
Your stepdad?

509
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,057
Yes. He's super rich.

510
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,601
Why didn't you stop Mom?

511
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,604
How could I? She loves him.

512
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,189
What about Dad?

513
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,940
He's working his butt off

514
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,735
-to live with you and Mom again.
-That's what I don't like.

515
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,071
Why does he work so hard?
Can't he just live?

how easy life is.

We eat at buffets, go on trips,
and go shopping.

00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,579
I can even study abroad now.

520
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,122
But look at Dad.

521
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,041
On his payday, he buys us fried chicken.

522
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,753
Then we have to pretend
it's the most delicious food in the world.

523
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,254
Aren't you tired of it?

524
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,048
I'm sick of it.

525
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,593
I can't stand the greasy smell.
It disgusts me.

00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,345
Is that why you didn't stop Mom?

527
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,099
Because you want to live an easy life?
Is that it?

528

It's a great reason.
Just you wait and see.

You should have followed Mom like me.

530
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,399
You made the wrong choice.

531
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,277
No, I don't think so.

532
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,949

00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,830
I'm not your sister anymore.

536
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,960
SEO IN-JAE

537
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,673
Hey, Seo In-jae!

538
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,008
What are you doing?

539
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,929
-Hey! Let go!
-What's wrong with you?

540
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,392
Let go!

541
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,310
What are you doing?

542
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,480
-Let go first!
-Are you crazy?

543
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,275
You look great.

544
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,901
I've been worried about you.

545
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,904
Why would you be? I'm doing great.

546
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,323
How's Grandma? Is she healthy?

547
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,452
Yes. Her hair started turning black again
a few years ago.

548
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,078
She's getting younger and younger.

549
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,039
Do you still live off Grandma?

550
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,752
Dal-mi, you clogged the drain again!
If you're going to stay here, pay me rent!

551
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,008
Do you think everyone is like you?

552
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,092
What do you mean?

553
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,138
You started a business
with your stepdad's money.

554
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,563
Yes. It's very hard
to start a business on your own.

555
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,398
START-UP RELAY LECTURE

556
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,399
What about you?

557
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,694
I guess you're interested
in starting a business.

558
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,613
Of course, I am.

559
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,325
-I'm working on an idea.
-Who's your partner?

560
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,035
Not Grandma, I hope.

561
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,286
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

562
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,456
Grandma, how about I quit my job
and open a second corn dog shop?

563
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,500
Have you ever been hit with a corn dog?

564
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,168
No.

565
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,587
My partner is someone else.

566
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,383
Someone competent, smart, and promising.

567
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,601
So who is it? Can you give me a name?

568
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,394
There's this guy. You don't know him.

569
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,774
When are you going back to the US?

570
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,734
At the end of the month.

571
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,818
I see.

572
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,697
You haven't answered me.

573
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,244
What's the name of this competent,
smart, and promising guy?

574
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,788
His name?

575
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,501
It's Do-san. Nam Do-san.

576
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,294
Nam Do-san?

577
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,213
That sounds familiar.

578
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,592
Isn't that the name of your pen-pal?

579
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,558
You remember his name?

580
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,601
Of course.

581
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,187
How could I forget it
after hearing you brag for years?

582
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,273
Have you even met him?

583
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,651
Don't tell me you guys are still platonic
or whatever it's called.

584
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,903
Platonic, my foot.

585
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,157
We're partners
in both eros and business terms.

586
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,534
We met yesterday, too.

587

PHOTO

588
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,876
Is he so smart and promising?

589
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,461
Totally.

590
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,464
He's the youngest winner
of the Mathematical Olympiad, remember?

591
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,316
I can give you a ride.

592
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,734
Don't bother.

593
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,446
Do-san is picking me up.

594
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,531
He is?

595
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,743
Do you have time next Friday?

596
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,453
Next Friday? Why?

597
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,788
My company is holding a networking event.

598
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,208
If you're planning to start a business,
it'll be a good opportunity.

599
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,587
Well, I'll think about it.

600
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,882
Oh, bring Do-san too.

601
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,799
Do-san…

602
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,844
Why should I?

603
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,389
Why? He's been such a good friend to you
for more than ten years.

604
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,183
I'd love to meet him as your sister.

605
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,104
Forget it. I'll tell him
that you invited him, though.

606
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,398
He's pretty shy.
He doesn't enjoy big events.

607
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,609
Suit yourself.

608
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,319
Bye.

609
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,246
-Thanks.
-For what?

610
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,167
I've always doubted my choice.

611
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,879
But I don't have to anymore.

612
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,881
What do you mean?

613
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,425
You cover the scratches on your shoes
with a marker.

614
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,471
And you talk about starting a business
with your imaginary boyfriend.

615
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,556
I can see
what kind of situation you're in.

616
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,353
-My situation?
-You live off your grandma,

617
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,980
work overtime without getting paid,

618
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,651
and get paid less than minimum wage.

619
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,530
Thanks for showing me the other option.

620
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,992
Thanks to you,
I don't have to doubt my choice anymore.

621
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,750
Let's go.

622
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,865
-What are you doing?
-Your networking event.

623
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,159
When and where will that be?

624
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,202
I'll come with Do-san.

625
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,391
You're crazy, Seo Dal-mi.

626
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,519
Why did you tell such a lie?

627
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,564
Why did you do that?

628
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,111
NATURE MORNING INVITES YOU

NO SEARCH RESULTS FOUND

635
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,064
What's with her?

636
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,695
Don't worry. I'm not crazy.

637
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,577
What the hell?

638
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,578
My gosh.

639
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:26,885
Is she crazy?

640
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,308
Is she sick?

CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

642
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,070
I'm here.

643
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,115
Why are you here?

644
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,701
You can take it easy on weekends.

645
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,203
-You don't have to help me.
-I'm not here to help you.

646
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,582
My job only pays me chump change,
so I have to work a side job.

647
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,834
Promise you'll pay me.

648
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,087
Goodness,
I can't believe the way you talk.

649
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,343
Grandma, about Do-san…

650
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,803
Is it him again?

651
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,305
Aren't you tired?

652
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,183
It's already been 15 years.

653
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,687
You said you've seen him, right?

654
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,150
I sure have.

655
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,655
He looks smart, handsome, and well-off.

656
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,620
You don't believe me?

657
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,080
I do.

658
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,540
I really do.

659
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,336
For some reason,
I really want to meet him today.

660
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,130
Even if it's for just one day.

661
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,840
Why?

662
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,135
Did something happen?

663
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,054
No.

664
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,364
This looks great. I'll take it.

665
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,827
You have great parents.

666
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,790
In addition to paying your tuition fees,
they're getting you this apartment?

667
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,625
When do you want to sign the contract?

668
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,795
Do you want to come back
with your parents?

669
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,838
I don't have parents.

670
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,590
What? Then who's going to sign…

671
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,677
I mean, who's going to pay?

672
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,596
I'm going to sign the contract
and pay myself.

673
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:22,102
You're still a student.
Are you sure you have the money?

674
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,146
Yes, I sure do.

675
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,939
I'd like to withdraw all my money.

676
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,399
MAEIL BANK

677
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,776
Do you want to close the account?

678
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,238
Yes. I'd like the money in cash.

679
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,742
Sure. Let me update your bankbook first.

680
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,079
May I ask why you're closing
the account, though?

681
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,293
My son runs a business,
and he put his house up as collateral.

682
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,671
If he fails to pay interest this month,
he'll get kicked out.

683
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,714
Oh, I see.

Are you sure you want all this money
in cash?

687
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,640
Yes, please.

688
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,435
You have 80 million won. All of this?

689
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,061
I have 80 million?

690
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,647
I thought it'd be eight million.

691
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,900
It is 80 million won, ma'am.

692
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,402
Lord.

693
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,947
Thank you.
But a 1,000-percent interest is too much.

694
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,700
This isn't interest.

695
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,204
Have you been trading stocks,
by any chance?

696
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,289
Stocks?

697
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,793
Yes. It seems
the money was made from stocks.

698
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,252
No way.

-Where did you get…
-It'll get you out of trouble this time.

712
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,063
No, I can still manage.

I'm not giving you this money for free.
It's an investment.

714
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,152
We'll sign a contract,
and I'll ask for shares in the company.

715
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,989
I heard the earlier you invest,
the more shares you get.

716
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,616
You have to give me every share I deserve.

717
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,744
Thank you.

718
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,330
Just a second.

719
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,251
Hello. Yes, speaking.

720
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,420
Pardon? Who?

721
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,506
No. I can come right now.

722
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,632
Where should we meet?

723
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,093
-Mom, I have to go.
-Sure, go ahead.

724
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,888
Can you send me the address?

725
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,182
I'll be right there. Thanks, Mom. See you.

726
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,145
Yes. I'm sorry.

727
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,315
I'm sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

728
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:58,568
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
Your head is bleeding.

729
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:03,323
I'm okay. I don't have time right now.

730
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,035
I'm sorry. I'm really fine.

731
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,497
I'm great, actually.

732
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,706
Excuse me.

733
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,585
Wait, sir!

734
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,963
BAEDAL.COM BUSINESS PLAN

735
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,847
I'm sorry.

736
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,684
I'm so nervous. My hands are shaking.

737
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,770
We can do this another time if you want.

738
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,398
There's no need. I'm really fine.

739
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,817
All right. Let's start.

740
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,529
Baedal.com provides

741
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,074
a network of delivery restaurants
all over the country

742
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,034
-so that users can--
-Mr. Seo.

743
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,371
We've already looked through
your business plan.

744
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,834
-I see.
-Yes, and we think it's a brilliant idea.

745
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,295
-Pardon?
-I like that your business model

746
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,840
can be transferred into mobile platforms.

747
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,759
Thank you.

748
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,803
But there's one thing I'd like to ask you.

749
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,472
As long as we agree on this matter,

750
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,725
we can proceed with our investment.

751
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,893
Sure, please go ahead.

752
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,272
Even though you're getting
more and more users,

753
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:22,235
it's still unclear
where the profits will come from.

754
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,738
Are you considering a paid service model?

755
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,202
I'm not.

756
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,290
I bet you've already put in
all the money you have.

757
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,625
And you're still focusing
on getting more users?

758
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:43,214
I believe attracting more users
should be our priority at this stage.

759
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,427
That means both you and the investors
won't see any profit for quite a while.

760
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,430
I'm afraid I can't compromise
on this matter.

761
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,767
I've seen many businesses
lose users while pursuing profits.

762
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,520
You're drifting in a vast ocean.

763
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,815
There are two things that can happen.

764
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:05,528
-You either die of thirst--
-Or starve to death?

765
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,197
No.

766
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,199
You survive.

767
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,707
No matter how thirsty you are,
you should never drink seawater.

768
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,336
You have to hold out until it rains.

769
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,465
Pursuing profits
in the early stage of a business

770
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,008
is like drinking seawater.

771
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:36,893
Please move forward with your plan.
We'll make an investment next week.

772
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,279
Thank you.

773
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,076
Well… Thank you.

774
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,206
I didn't know this day would come.

775
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,627
My nose is bleeding.

776
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm so happy that my nose bleeds.

777
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,092
Congratulations.

778
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,511
Thank you.

779
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,763
Thank you.

780
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,267
Gosh.

781
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,103
Hey, Good Boy. Can you help me carry this?

782
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,606
Good Boy! Hey! Help me carry this.

783
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,776
That brat.

784
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,653
My gosh.

785
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,161
Hey, where are you going?

786
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,455
-I'm going to Seoul.
-Why, all of a sudden?

787
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,873
I got into university.

788
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,876
Thank you for everything.

789
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,045
Still, you can't just leave like this.

790
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,341
What about you?
How could you do this to me?

791
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,636
-What are you talking about?
-That's my money, not yours!

792
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,847
The account may be under your name,

793
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,599
but I'm the one who made the money.

794
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,102
That's incredible.
Ten times more money in just a year?

795
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,272
You took the money knowing that I made it?

796
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,275
Is that why you followed me
to the bank that day?

797
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,485
To borrow my name?

798
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,904
That's…

799
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,954
Yes. That's why.

800
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,041
Do you know what it's like
being an orphan at my age?

801
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:26,669
The orphanage gave me two million won
and kicked me out because I'm a grown-up.

802
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,839
And I'm supposed to pay
for food, clothing, and shelter.

803
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,842
But I can't even open a bank account
because I'm a minor.

804
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,719
I'm neither a kid nor an adult.

805
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,513
How ridiculous is that?

806
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,643
And then I met you, an old pushover.

807
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,770
That's why I followed you.

808
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,064
Did you think I did that
because I was grateful?

809
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,941
That kind of kindness

810
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,360
is something I can't afford.

811
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,114
You lured me

812
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,910
into writing those stupid letters
by calling me a good boy.

813
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,580
Gosh, I was an idiot.

814
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,333
Give me back my money!

815
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,170
Where are you going?

816
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,881
Go to your son and tell him to
give my money back! Now!

817
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,279
Why would I ever take your money?

818
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,909
Then what about the money
you gave to your son?

819
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,038
It was my money.

820
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,716
Goodbye.

821
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,664
Hi, Dad.

822
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,583
How did it go?

823
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,295
Dal-mi, I'm getting an investment.

824
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,881
Really? That's incredible.

825
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,466
Congratulations.

826
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,134
This is just the beginning.

827
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,803
I'm going to make it big

828
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,306
so we can live
with your mom and sister again.

829
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:45,975
What?

830
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,935
You don't trust me?

831
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,522
Can I be honest?

832
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,483
Hold on.

833
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,236
Hear me out first.

834
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,740
I'm sure it'll change your mind.

835
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,450
I can picture

836
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,953
what the world will be like in the future.

837
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,206
Take a look around.

838
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,750
Many people have cell phones
these days, right?

839
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,002
-Yes.
-Well…

840
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,339
Imagine cell phones becoming
better and better.

841
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,258
What if we could use them
to take pictures, listen to music,

842
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,843
and surf the internet?

843
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,180
That'd be nice, I guess.

844
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,975
Hey, it won't just be nice.

845
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,853
It'll change the world completely.

846
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,439
I didn't quit my job

847
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,360
because my boss hit me.

848
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,279
I quit my job to prepare for a new world.

849
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,992
What do you think?
Don't you think I'll be successful?

850
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,453
Can I be honest?

851
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,165
Hey, you still don't trust me?

852
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,377
-I believe…
-I believe you.

853
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,713
You'll be a huge success.

854
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,923
Hey.

855
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,679
Why are you crying? You're making me sad.

856
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,140
I'm not crying.

857
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,683
It's just…

858
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,393
Chicken.

859
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,479
I want to have fried chicken.

860
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,041
That's easy.

861
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,252
I'll get some Coke, too.

862
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,757
It doesn't cost much anyway.
I can afford that much.

863
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,509
So you can tell me anytime.

864
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,262
For how long?

865
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,308
For the rest of your life.

866
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,312
So tell me any time you crave something.

867
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,230
It's no problem.

868
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,527
I took the time we spent together
for granted

869
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,739
when every moment was a gift.

870
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,284
I've made up my mind

871
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:12,205
to stop filling my days with regrets.

872
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,374
Wait just a second.

873
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,960
I'll bring some chicken soon.

874
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:19,796
Dad.

875
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,089
What is it?

876
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,763
I love you.

877
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:41,275
Are you saying that
because I'm buying you chicken?

878
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,320
No. I love you even if you don't.

879
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:50,034
You know how much I love you, right?

880
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,788
I do.

881
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,958
My girl.

882
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,337
I love you, too.

883
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,939
That elevator is out of service.

884
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,067
-Take this one.
-Okay. Thank you.

885
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,077
Let's discuss the details
about the investment next week.

886
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,036
Sure.

887
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,052
Your nose is bleeding again.

888
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,932
Well, use this.

889
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,268
Thank you. I appreciate it.

890
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,855
I'll wash it and return it to you.

891
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,483
Running a business is hard, right?

892
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:06,903
Yes, kind of.

893
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,992
To be honest, it's really hard.

894
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,246
If you succeed, you're called a CEO.

895
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,290
If you fail, you're called a fraud.

896
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,585
It's a scary world.

897
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,921
I know.

898
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,257
You fall and get hurt all the time.

899
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,221
I wish I could at least fall
on sand instead of concrete.

900
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,515
Then I wouldn't get hurt.

901
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,351
Sand?

902
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,855
My daughter once fell off a swing

903
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,398
and hurt her knees.

904
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,818
My wife told her not to
ride the swing again,

905
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,570
but my daughter asked us

906
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,448
to cover the ground with sand.

907
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,852
Dal-mi.

908
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,493
She must have loved swings.

909
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,912
She sure did.

910
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,915
With sand on the ground,

911
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,792
she could swing as high as she wanted.

912
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,921
I wish I could fall on soft sand, too.

913
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,008
Then I'd feel less scared
running a business.

914
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,679
But when I fall,
I fall on the cold, hard ground.

915
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,142
I know what you mean.

916
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,270
Doors opening.

917
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,230
I'll be going then.

918
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,818
-See you next week.
-See you.

919
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,696
Well… Ms. Yoon.

920
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,491
Do you know any nice chicken place
around here?

921
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,177
TO SEOUL

922
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,931
Your worn-out shoes
have been bothering me,

923
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,059
so I bought a new pair for you.
Try them on.

924
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,897
-Are you trying to make me feel guilty?
-What do you mean?

925
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:50,900
They say if you give
someone shoes, they'll run away.

926
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:54,403
I'm going to run away in these shoes
and become rich with this money.

927
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,072
A lot richer than you.

928
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,450
Wouldn't that make you jealous?

929
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:02,745
It would.

930
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,334
I'd be so jealous I couldn't eat or sleep.

931
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,836
It'd drive me crazy.

932
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,254
So what do you want me to do?

933
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,840
Should I return the money to you?

934
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,301
Good Boy. I know you're just saying that.

935
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,103
Promise me.

936
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,897
If you become successful--

937
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:34,318
Forget it. I'll just pay you back now.
I'm not going to pay any interest later.

938
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,865
If you become successful, don't call me.

939
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:44,912
Don't call me if you become rich and get
married. Don't call me if you're happy.

940
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:46,455
I don't want to feel jealous.

941
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:48,582
But call me…

942
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,463
if you're going through a rough patch.

943
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,299
Come to me if it's raining

944
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,386
and you have nowhere to go
like you once did.

945
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,973
Don't just stand in the rain.

946
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,810
You know where to find the keys.

947
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,830
The bus for Seoul is about to leave.

948
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:29,665

01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,518

950
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,937
Do you have any wishes?

951
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,397
What? I can't hear you.

952
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,736
Tell me what you want.

953
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,697
I have to pay you back.

954
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:05,075
You know I never owe anyone anything.

955
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,787
So tell me what you want.

956
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,415
I don't want anything.
Hurry up and get on the bus.

957
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,355
Take care, okay?

958
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,448
Are you okay?

959
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,786
Yes.

965
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:45,301
It's shaking.

966
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,720
What's wrong with my hand?

967
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,805
Oh, my. You're very drunk.

968
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:57,855
I… didn't… drink.

969
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,899
You're completely wasted.

970
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,073
What's…

971
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,036

I sometimes wonder.

975
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:43,192

what would that spring have meant to me?

979
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,283
I would have grieved

980
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:37,121
over fallen flowers

981
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,332
rather than enjoying the flowers in bloom.

The only thing I remember

985
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:19,640
from that spring would have been
losing the person I love more than anyone

986
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,726

what the world will be like in the future.

1025
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,631

Imagine cell phones becoming
better and better.

1029
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,975
What if we could use them
to take pictures, listen to music,

1030
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,727
and surf the internet?

1031
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,563
