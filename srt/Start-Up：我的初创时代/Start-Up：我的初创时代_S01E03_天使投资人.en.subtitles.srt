00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,695
EPISODE 3

2
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,781
You're meeting Seo Dal-mi, right?

3
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,157
Yes.

4
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,785
How do you know that?

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,369
I'll explain in my car.

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,622
Wait. I just need to hand this over.

7
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,832
-I just need five minutes.
-Okay, let's go.

8
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,501
-Come on.
-Just five minutes.

9
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,846
TO DO-SAN

10
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,556
"To Do-san."

11
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,142
Is this letter really for me?

12
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,437
Well… I mean, yes.

13
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,069
"Have you ever wandered on purpose…"
No, I've never done that.

14
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,822
Can you just keep on reading?

15
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,868
HAVE YOU EVER WANDERED ON PURPOSE?

16
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:00,912
"Today, I…"

17
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,131
Today, I wandered aimlessly on purpose.

18
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,604
Have you ever let yourself get soaked
even though you had an umbrella?

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,316
That's what I did today.

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,194
It was a sweltering day,

21
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,030
and the rain totally cooled me down.

22
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,449
After walking…

23
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,828
"After walking for 30 minutes like that,

24
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,746
the rain stopped,

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,875
and an unbelievably beautiful scene
unfolded before my eyes."

26
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,170
I saw a huge rainbow.

27
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,508
It looked as though
it'd grant me any wish.

28
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,054
Then it suddenly hit me.

29
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,182
It's actually nice

30
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
to wander aimlessly every once in a while.

31
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,355
From time to time…

32
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,816
"From time to time,

33
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,946
it'd be wonderful
to sail off without a map."

34
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,621
This Seo Dal-mi…

35
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,498
She sounds very eccentric.

36
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,460
You think so?
I could actually relate to it.

37
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,669
I can't.

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,922
Why wander when you know
where you're going?

39
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,757
You have an umbrella. Why get soaked?

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,134
She saw a rainbow
after wandering for a while.

41
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,135
A double rainbow.

42
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,763
Right, that's the part
I don't understand the most.

43
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,264
Why make a wish on a rainbow?

44
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,767
It's just light reflecting and refracting.

45
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,394
Hey, that's not the point.

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,147
Are we even on the same page?

47
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,691
Did you fail your Korean exams?

48
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,860
Oh, that was never my forte.

49
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,612
But in math and science I got good--

50
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,322
Do you not understand the letter?

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,658
"Rainbow" isn't the keyword.

52
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,078
-Right.
-Yes.

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:05,995
Okay.

54
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,125
Then what is the keyword?

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,880
What am I going to do with you?

56
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,062
AN INVESTOR
WHO INVESTS IN BUDDING START-UPS

57
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,690
AND PROVIDES MENTORSHIP

58
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,033
Cheers.

59
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,538
When's the launch?

60
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,791
The full beta version will probably
come out at the end of the year.

61
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,917
-Nice.
-That's quick.

62
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
I told you he's good.

63
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,004
Will you expand into Southeast Asia?

64
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,380
Of course.

65
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,423
-I knew it.
-For sure.

66
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,757
It's sooner than I thought.

67
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,469
Oh, boy.

68
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,553
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,274
-Good evening. Thank you for coming.
-Hello.

70
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,988
-Nicole!
-In-jae.

71
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
Will I see you before I leave for the US?

72
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,995
-Yes, when do you go to San Francisco?
-Next Tuesday.

73
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh, it's soon.

74
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,959
How is your…

75
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,420
Oh, it's fine. And you?

76
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,922
-I'm fine.
-Fine? Good.

77
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,132
You're going tomorrow?

78
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,113
Have you been waiting long?

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,450
Yes, very long.

80
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,455
I missed you.

81
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,842
Well, I'm…

82
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,137
Sorry, this isn't the time to catch up.

83
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,222
My mom and sister are here.

84
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,557
I lied to my sister

85
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,476
that I see you every day and that we are

86
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,894
romantically involved.

87
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,187
What? "Romantically"?

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,981
Ridiculous, right? I know.

89
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,650
I talked total nonsense,
but just play along.

90
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,901
I'm not a good liar.

91
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,863
Just today.
I can't make a fool of myself here.

92
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,030
So please…

93
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,662
Hey, In-jae. I was looking for you.

94
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,080
I was looking for you, too.

95
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,499
I thought you were hiding somewhere.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,751
Why would I hide?

97
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,712
You're all grown up.

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,048
I almost couldn't recognize you.

99
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,342
Same here.

100
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,763
You've changed a lot, Mother.

101
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,932
"Mother"?

102
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,351
Just call me Mom.

103
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,896
Is he…

104
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,356
Yes, this is Do-san. Nam Do-san.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,274
My boyfriend.

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,653
-Hello.
-I've heard a lot about you.

107
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm Won In-jae, CEO of Nature Morning.

108
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,908
Oh, hello.

109
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,368
I'm Dal-mi's…
Can I introduce myself as your sister?

110
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
Sure.

111
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,915
Dal-mi bragged about you.

112
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,458
You two will co-found a company?

113
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,044
Pardon? No, not really.

114
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,507
No?

115
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,136
You said you guys are preparing
to start a company.

116
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,846
Right.

117
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,519
That was actually--

118
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,939
What she meant by that was
we'll be working together.

119
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,359
-Is that so?
-Yes.

120
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,363
I asked her to join my company as CEO.

121
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,243
-CEO?
-Yes.

122
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,664
But she doesn't trust us yet. So maybe
the two of you can convince her.

123
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,208
Then I need to know
what your company does.

124
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,211
-Got a business card?
-Yes, I do.

125
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,174
SAMSAN TECH

126
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,135
I'm Nam Do-san, the CEO of Samsan Tech.

127
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,762
"CEO"?

128
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,725
My gosh, I'm amazed every time I hear it.

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,396
SAMSAN TECH

130
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,313
INQUIRE TO INVEST

131
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,566
Your business card is

132
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,526
pretty unique.

133
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,362
It's retro. Retro is very popular
at the moment, you know.

134
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,447
Did you start a funding round?

135
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,657
A STAGE IN START-UP FINANCING

136
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,493
Pardon? A round?

137
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
Sorry?

138
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,165
Well…

139
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:48,129
Things have been moving rather quickly
since round one.

140
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,172
"Round one"?

141
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,217
You've never secured funding?

142
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,387
You don't know what that means?

143
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,350
A funding round is… The thing is…

144
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,854
It's a seed stage company
we're immensely interested in.

145
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,898
I'd say it's a pre-Series A company.
Right, Mr. Nam?

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,028
Yes. That's right, pre-Series A.

147
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,571
Mr. Han.

148
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,283
-You know him?
-Yes, he's an angel…

149
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,951
I mean, he's Mr. Han Ji-pyeong.

150
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,538
I'm Han Ji-pyeong from SH Venture Capital.
Ms. Seo Dal-mi, right?

151
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,290
Mr. Nam has told me a lot about you.

152
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,459
Oh, really?

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,007
Mr. Nam, could you spare me a moment?

154
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,010
-Sure.
-Please excuse us.

155
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,349
Did you check your e-mail?

156
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,643
-Sorry?
-I sent you the term sheet.

157
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,103
Just laugh and act natural.

158
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,313
CONDITIONS OF BUSINESS AGREEMENT

159
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,900
It seems like he's doing very well
for himself.

160
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,027
Right? Isn't he so cool?

161
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,242
As they say,
birds of a feather flock together.

162
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,915
Why are you here?

163
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,377
I told you that Sand Box
is beyond my ability.

164
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,920
Right, I know.

165
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,713
I don't expect anything.

166
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,676
Then why are you here?
Do you work for UNICEF or something?

167
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,219
You're just here to help?

168
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,305
But I'm not sure if I was helpful.

169
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,601
You were.

170
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,770
People already think you're a hotshot CEO.

171
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,687
Me?

172
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,774
-Why?
-Because you're with me.

173
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,028
-Are you boasting now?
-I'm just being honest.

174
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,074
Keep talking to look like a hotshot.

175
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,119
-Talk about what?
-Just… Say anything.

176
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,454
The lyrics of the national anthem.

177
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,752
"Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away
and the East Sea's waters run dry."

178
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,175
"May God protect
and preserve our country."

179
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,719
Nice one.

180
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,724
You should've told me
your boyfriend was in this industry.

181
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,436
I could've helped him
before going back to the US.

182
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,147
Well…

183
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,566
I don't think he needs your help.

184
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,825
"As the pine atop Namsan

185
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,535
-stands firm."
-"Stands firm."

186
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,466
Dad will be here soon.
You should stay and say hi to him.

187
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,886
Why would I? He's your dad.

188
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,306
Your last name is Won,
whereas mine is Seo.

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,684
Is that so?

190
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,612
Where are you going?
The valet attendants are over there.

191
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,281
Oh, the bus--

192
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,408
You drove here, right?
Come, it's this way.

193
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,410
Wait here.

194
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,204
-But I…
-Come on.

195
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:14,919
Hello.

196
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,799
-You know how to drive, right?
-Sure.

197
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,968
Gosh, that doesn't sound assuring.

198
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,053
My car is expensive.

199
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,055
I rarely use it because I treasure it…

200
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,598
Forget it.

201
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,851
Give a safe ride home.

202
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,728
Why should I drive you home?

203
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,646
No.

204
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,523
Not me, her.

205
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,817
Take my car and drive Seo Dal-mi home.

206
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,237
Be nice.

207
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,988
Talk about something…

208
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,617
No, don't talk to her.
Just keep your mouth shut.

209
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,078
Just nod along and smile here and there.

210
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,746
Yes, that's it.

211
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,790
Be the quiet, good-looking guy.

212
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,252
After that,
give an excuse and cut her out.

213
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,419
What kind of excuse?

214
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,505
Just one of the common excuses guys give.

215
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,802
A terminal illness?

216
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,263
No, that's too extreme.

217
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,058
Oh, just tell her you have a girlfriend.
That will be the simplest.

218
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,184
Say you're engaged.

219
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,937
But I'm single.
I've never had a girlfriend.

220
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,233
-You're proud of that?
-I'm just being honest.

221
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,360
Jeez…

222
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,739
Return the car right away.
Don't get side-tracked.

223
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,409
Search "home" on the GPS.

224
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,245
You can do this, right?

225
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,581
Yes, don't worry.

226
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,589
The gear stick is on the right.

227
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,007
-This one?
-No, that one.

228
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,050
As for the blinkers… It's on your left.

229
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,478
Dal-mi.

230
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,903
Can I give you a hug?

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,323
No, I'm…

232
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,539
You must think I'm shameless,

233
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,708
but I missed you very much.

234
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,628
I worried about you a lot.

235
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,506
I'm really sorry.

236
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,678
I'm so grateful to see that you've grown
into such a wonderful young lady.

237
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,857
It's hot. Let's just talk like this.

238
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,110
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,573
As you can see, I've been doing well,

240
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,493
working hard and dating here and there.

241
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,747
Every day, I am grateful
for the choice I made that day.

242
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,836
So you don't need to be sorry.

243
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,089
Dal-mi, I--

244
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,217
And from now on,
you shouldn't worry about me

245
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,260
because my life will get even better.

246
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,600
I'll be honest. At the moment,
I'm not as successful as In-jae is.

247
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,143
I admit it.

248
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,104
But In-jae is three years older than me.

249
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,981
So give me three years.

250
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll outdo her by then.

251
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,321
Let's bet 10,000 won. What do you think?

252
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,033
-Did you say 10,000 won?
-Anything more than that

253
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,285
is considered gambling
according to Grandma.

254
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,955
Sure. 10,000 won, it is.

255
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,124
But it won't be easy to outdo me.

256
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,333
I know that, of course.

257
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,836
That's why I want to work with Do-san

258
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,878
and grow the company.

259
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,716
I'll try to get on Steve Jobs
or Mark Zuckerberg's level

260
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,176
so you won't dare to outdo me.

261
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,930
-Look at you bluffing.
-I've learned to dream big.

262
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,226
Your dream is so unrealistic

263
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,978
that I'm actually intrigued.

264
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,063
Right? I won't let you down.

265
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,736
I'll be off, then.

266
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,324
Dal-mi.

267
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,924
Bluffing without a real plan

268
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,801
makes you a fraud.

269
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,763
Sorting things out afterward

270
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,808
makes you the same as your father.

271
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm rooting for you.

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,964
I should go.

273
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,785
Hey, what's your address?

274
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,749
Can you just drive?

275
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,793
I need to enter your address to…

276
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,172
Are you crying?

277
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,216
Hey, why…

278
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,260
Just drive. Please.

279
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:58,846
Okay.

280
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,360
AVAILABLE

281
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,489
Could you please follow that white car?

282
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,235
I'm rooting for you.

283
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,115
Damn it. I'm so annoyed.

284
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,621
Why does she have to confuse me like this?

285
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,295
Here.

286
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,465
Thanks.

287
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,933
Isn't it a little hot?
Should I turn the AC on?

288
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,517
Where's the button?

289
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,396
Oh, what the…

290
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,860
Why is this opening?

291
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,410
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,997
Let's just drive like this.

293
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,041
The wind feels nice.

294
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,086
I've never been in a convertible before.

295
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,462
Same here.

296
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,422
You, too?

297
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,343
I mean, this is actually better.
I like the cool breeze.

298
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,519
My place is actually the other way.

299
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,396
What?

300
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,690
Really?

301
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,944
I can't make a U-turn here.

302
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,946
It'll be a while.

303
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,698
That's good.

304
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,703
Is that Sand Box over there?

305
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,359
It's so pretty.

306
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,161
Yes.

307
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,538
How pretty.

308
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,457
What?

309
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,211
I'm starving.

310
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,840
Me, too.

311
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,368
What's with him these days?
He always has to be

312
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,329
the last one to arrive, doesn't he?

313
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,455
You look great.

314
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,209
-Can you call a taxi for me?
-Yes, ma'am.

315
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,544
You're leaving? You should say hi to Dad.

316
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,005
I'm very emotional today.

317
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,924
I'm not in the mood to keep him company.

318
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,348
-What's Sang-su doing here?
-Congratulations.

319
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,225
The right question would be…

320
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,019
Why did Dad bring him?

321
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,313
You didn't know?

322
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,856
This party was organized

323
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,609
so that Sang-su could build connections.

324
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,531
Are you kidding me?
He's just my secretary.

325
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,740
Secretary?

326
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,119
Hey, do you think
your dad is letting him work for you

327
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,204
just so he could be your secretary?

328
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,834
He knows you work hard,
so he wants Sang-su to watch and learn.

329
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,961
-Then…
-So he can take credit for everything.

330
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,213
No, so he can steal everything from you.

331
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,923
-Mom.
-Wake up, you fool.

332
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,926
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

333
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,476
Sang-su seems naive, but he's a weasel.

334
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
You look smart, but you're clueless.

335
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,731
Wake up,
or he'll steal everything from you.

336
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,483
Either be a sly fox,

337
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,360
or be mean like you always are with me.

338
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,612
Have you no pride?

339
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,864
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

340
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,534
Nice to meet you.

341
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,536
-Likewise.
-You're late, Dad.

342
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,079
Hey, In-jae.

343
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,500
-You're here too, Sang-su.
-Yes, hi.

344
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,669
-That looks great on you.
-Thank you.

345
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,296
Dad, introduce me to those people.

346
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,881
Sure. Hi.

347
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,518
I'm pretty sure
they're somewhere around here.

348
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,937
I told him to take her straight home.

349
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,564
He just doesn't listen.

350
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,876
Goodness, what a sight. Look at those two.

351
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,006
Gosh, I feel so much better now.

352
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,427
Here's your dessert.

353
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,314
You're not going to ask?

354
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,359
Ask what?

355
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,112
The reason I suddenly asked you to come

356
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,032
and bluffed like that
in front of my mom and sister.

357
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,493
And why I cried.

358
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,079
Aren't you curious?

359
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,167
I am curious.

360
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,253
Then why not ask?

361
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,257
It's because…

362
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,219
Right now,

363
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,598
I'm playing the quiet, good-looking guy.

364
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,810
What?

365
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,443
I shouldn't laugh.

366
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,323
If you laugh right after you cry, hair
grows where it's not supposed to grow.

367
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,201
No, don't worry. That's completely false.

368
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,120
Otherwise, everyone would have more hair

369
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,871
on their butt than their head.

370
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,541
Such emotional changes are very common,

371
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,500
so don't worry.

372
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,461
Really? That makes me feel better.

373
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,221
Is it because I'm not playing
the quiet, good-looking girl?

374
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,390
I'm curious.

375
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,684
About what?

376
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,521
You. I want to know everything about you.

377
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,358
Your family, friends,

378
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,944
and the things you like.

379
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,783
It'll bore you.

380
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,037
Even my parents get bored when I speak.

381
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,080
Still, tell me.

382
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,215
I like…

383
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,351
What the heck are they talking about?

384
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,402
Boring, right?

385
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,364
No, it was very interesting.

386
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,909
And cool.

387
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,381
Just a second.

388
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,718
What are you doing?

389
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,638
Drive her home
and end it once and for all.

390
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,773
-Who was that?
-What?

391
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,859
No one.

392
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,487
Your girlfriend, I guess.

393
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,949
Of course, you have a girlfriend.

394
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,409
I knew it.

395
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,911
How could you be single?

396
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,207
I'll take you home.

397
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,961
No, my place is very close.
I'll just walk home.

398
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,296
-Still--
-No, it's really okay.

399
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,340
Your girlfriend will misunderstand.
Go home.

400
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,431
Well, I'll get going then.

401
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,725
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

402
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,366
We can't introduce
that good-for-nothing as our son.

403
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,120
My first son has no job
and runs a lousy business.

404
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,289
Who would want to marry you?

405
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,501
Among the start-ups
that I didn't invest in,

406
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,627
zero succeeded.

407
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,628
None of them.

408
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,841
That's why I'm never going to invest
in your company.

409
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
Do-san,

410
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,188
you're my pretty music box.

411
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,443
I bet you have a lovely melody.

412
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,612
I'm sure of it.

413
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,085
Hey!

414
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,712
Come on. Quick.

415
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,218
Wait, Dal-mi!

416
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,053
What? What now?

417
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,805
Yes?

418
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,390
Have you opened the music box?

419
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,142
Music box? God damn it.

420
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,898
Yes.

421
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,361
What did it sound like?

422
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,241
It was

423
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,452
unbelievably

424
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,917
wonderful.

425
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,483
I think I've figured out the keyword.

426
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,277
What keyword?

427
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,120
"Sail off without a map."

428
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,458
Hey, wait. Nam Do-san!

429
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,168
Hey!

430
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,849
It was very unlike me, but I thought

431
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,814
the exact same thing at that moment.

432
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,830
That it wouldn't be bad

433
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,376
to sail off without a map
even if we were to get lost.

434
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,930
If it's with you, that is.

435
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,643
Take this.

436
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,355
-My business card.
-Why is he giving her that?

437
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,356
SAMSAN TECH

438
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,774
SAMSAN TECH, NAM DO-SAN

439
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,400
Can I really take this?

440
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,861
-Your girlfriend--
-No, I don't have a girlfriend.

441
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:27,779
I never had one.

442
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,615
I went to all-boys school my whole life.
I've never dated.

443
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,367
-Really?
-Yes.

444
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,412
Same here. I've never dated anyone either.

445
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,876
I mean, there were guys who liked me.

446
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,253
But I never even glanced at them.

447
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,714
Because of you.

448
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,180
You've got to be kidding me.

449
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,185
Look here, "On standby 24/7."
You can call me anytime.

450
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,106
-A retro-style business card.
-That's right.

451
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,275
One more thing.

452
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,861
Here's the signed ball.

453
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,531
Right.

454
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,907
TO NAM DO-SAN

455
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,288
That's nice.

456
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,727
Jeez, this is nuts.

457
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,699
"Sail off without a map"?

458
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,244
So you gave her your business card?

459
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,789
Recklessly, without even thinking
about the consequences?

460
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,751
-Yes, you could say that.
-Look.

461
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,420
If you do that, you'll die.

462
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,715
Whether you meet a storm or a shark,
you will die for sure.

463
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
But you said you could relate to it.

464
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,843
That was a figure of speech.

465
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,680
What is a metaphor?

466
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,267
A metaphor is a figure of speech
that describes an object or action

467
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,770
-in a way that is not--
-Shut up!

468
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,272
Okay, I will shut up.

469
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,402
So what are you going to do?

470
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,695
Will you see her again?

471
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,863
And lie to her again?

472
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,616
So you'll keep on lying
for thousands of years to come?

473
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,868
No, not for thousands of years.

474
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,454
-The maximum life span--
-That's not what this is about.

475
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,538
God!

476
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,208
You totally cut me off!

477
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,168
Anyway, no more.

478
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,920
The show's over.

479
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,630
Do not contact her ever again.

480
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,006
Okay.

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,802
But what if she contacts me first?

482
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,012
-You heard from her?
-Yes.

483
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,933
I've never received
a text from a girl before

484
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,559
except for my mom.

485
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,065
Good for you. Your family must be proud.

486
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,441
Thank you.

487
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,694
-What did she say? Let me see.
-Here.

488
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,365
It was nice meeting you today.

489
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,742
Thanks for your help. I owe you one.

490
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,953
I'm hoping for an opportunity
to repay you.

491
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,580
Are you craving anything?
Or is there anything you want?

492
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,707
I'm craving fried chicken.

493
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,709
Anything I want?

494
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,506
-A 128GB USB flash drive.
-Are you crazy?

495
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,050
-Delete that now.
-Okay.

496
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,262
From now on,
show me before you send her any texts.

497
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,680
-Okay.
-Write this down.

498
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,431
-"Write this down."
-No!

499
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,100
Don't write that down.

500
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,768
-Write down what I say.
-Got it.

501
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,272
No need to repay me.

502
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,065
"No need to repay me."

503
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,943
You already thanked me,
and that's more than enough.

504
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,237
"You already thanked me…"

505
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,406
-That's more than enough.
-"More than enough."

506
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,074
Sweet dreams.

507
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,205
What? What is it?

508
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,206
Nothing.

509
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,876
"Sweet dreams."

510
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,210
SWEET DREAMS LOL

511
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,503
Take out "lol."

512
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,046
Take it out?

513
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,214
-Delete it!
-Okay.

514
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,973
It's him!

515
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,809
DO-SAN
SWEET DREAMS

516
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,647
My gosh, thanks. Sweet dreams to you, too.

517
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,860
Dal-mi, I'm home!

518
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,570
Grandma!

519
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,572
I'm home!

520
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,035
-Grandma, Grandma!
-Oh, dear.

521
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,872
Why are you so being so loud?
I think my ears are bleeding.

522
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,165
I saw Do-san today.

523
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,792
-He gave me his number.
-What?

524
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,669
Which Do-san?

525
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,755
What do you mean? Nam Do-san.

526
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,923
My first love!

527
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,133
You said he stood you up.

528
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,010
We finally met. The timing was perfect.

529
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,304
He showed up, looking like a runway model.

530
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,557
What? He's good-looking?

531
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,227
Yes, like a model.
He looks amazing in a suit.

532
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,603
My heart almost stopped.

533
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,940
The worst of the worst.

534
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,736
Most men look good
when they put on a suit.

535
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,279
It's hard not to look good.

536
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,698
But Nam Do-san managed
not to look good in a suit.

537
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,826
Dal-mi said he's very tall, like a model.

538
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,411
He is tall, but that's about it.

539
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,580
He's lanky like a bean sprout.

540
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
Do you need this?

541
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,667
And his hair… Jeez.

542
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,835
Who cuts hair like that these days?

543
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,128
I bet he cut it himself.

544
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,257
That awful haircut. Gosh!

545
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
And what did he do when he got there?

546
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,135
Did he help Dal-mi?

547
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,720
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

548
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,222
Did he help her or not?

549
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,225
Do-san is the star of the night

550
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,103
Do-san is the star of the night

551
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,816
Grandma, do you know what AI is?
Artificial intelligence.

552
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,194
Yes, of course. People talk about
AlphaGo a lot on TV these days.

553
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,529
He works in that industry.

554
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,615
It's the hottest field
in the tech industry now.

555
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,993
-But you know what's so surprising?
-What?

556
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,120
He's so modest.

557
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,872
He's not a show-off at all.

558
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,375
He listened to all my nonsense
and drove me home

559
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,128
like a true gentleman.
Gosh, he's an angel.

560
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,379
He doesn't need laws.

561
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,176
He's a psychopath.

562
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,763
No empathy or emotions.

563
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,266
I thought I was talking to a robot.

564
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,226
Dal-mi called him an angel.

565
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,562
Because I covered for him.

566
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,939
Gosh, he told so many lies.

567
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,276
I sweat buckets
trying to cover up all his lies.

568
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,486
Thanks for your hard work.

569
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,490
Sounds like you went above and beyond
to help Dal-mi save face.

570
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,827
I don't want to go on about it,

571
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,038
but it was so stressful. For real.

572
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,875
All right. Good job.

573
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,794
Dal-mi said

574
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,964
God

575
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,968
must have felt bad for everything
he put her through.

576
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,179
Maybe that's why

577
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,183
God gave her yesterday as a gift.
That's what she thinks.

578
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,226
She said even when she turns 100

579
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,022
she'll remember every second
of every minute.

580
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,649
It felt like a dream.

581
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,614
She's overreacting.

582
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,868
It's all thanks to you.

583
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,122
I'm worried about what's going to happen.

584
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,042
She'll find out in no time
that Nam Do-san is a total loser.

585
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,879
-Don't worry.
-What? Why?

586
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,464
Just mind your own business now.

587
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,257
I'll sort it out on my own.

588
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,093
You'll sort it out? How?

589
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,844
Tell her the truth.

590
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,389
That I wrote the fake letters

591
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,266
and hired Do-san.

592
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,102
What?

593
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,437
Life isn't a dream, you know.

594
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,506
SEO DAL-MI

595
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,312
It was a good dream,
and she seems to have slept well.

596
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,441
It's time to wake her up.

597
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,443
I knew it.

598
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,778
But why…

599
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,993
She'll be so disappointed.

600
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,412
It's bound to happen, sooner or later.

601
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,498
Better now than later.

602
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,335
Right. That is true, but…

603
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,301
Thanks, Ji-pyeong.

604
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,595
For everything you did.

605
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,765
When will you tell her?

606
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,603
Soon.

607
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,766
Yeong-sil.

608
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,268
Why can't I fall asleep?

609
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,395
You must have something on your mind.

610
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,151
Yes, I do. What should I do?

611
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:12,988
Get a good night's sleep.
Tomorrow, when you wake up well-rested,

612
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,366
you'll get fresh ideas.

613
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,159
What did I even expect?

614
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,248
Yeong-sil.

615
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,126
I can't sleep.

616
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,338
You must have something on your mind.

617
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,363
The meeting is at 11, right?

618
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,698
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,922
FOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH

620
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,633
I want the typography
to be a little bolder.

621
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,051
Can you add a drop shadow?

622
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,890
I-su, can you confirm my flight?

623
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,352
Ma'am, you have a board meeting
this evening.

624
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,855
Board meeting?

625
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,065
My flight leaves soon.

626
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,483
I called the meeting.

627
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,320
Dad.

628
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,740
Hey, he suddenly…

629
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,827
I mean, he called and said
he wanted to see you, ma'am.

630
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,331
I saw you yesterday. What's going on?

631
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,916
I wanted to see my beautiful daughter
before she left.

632
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,669
Also, there's something
I'd like to discuss.

633
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,430
You came back after so long

634
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,307
but had no time to rest. Are you tired?

635
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,685
No, I'm fine.

636
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,270
Gosh, she's not fine.

637
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,524
She's sleep-deprived. She looks exhausted.

638
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,069
Look, that's from a nosebleed.

639
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,321
Thanks for your concern,

640
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,531
but I'm really fine.

641
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,158
Okay.

642
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,118
I was too selfish.

643
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,080
As your dad,
I should've looked after your health.

644
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,123
Dad, I'm--

645
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,626
Why don't you have your brother
handle things here

646
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,586
and just focus on the US branch?

647
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,006
Do you think
your dad is letting him work for you

648
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,716
just so he could be your secretary?

649
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,261
My gosh. No, Dad.

650
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,056
No way. I can't run a company.

651
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,643
That's right.
Also, the employees won't be happy.

652
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,562
And the investors won't understand
the sudden change either.

653
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,690
Investors? Who?

654
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,235
-What's my ownership percentage?
-It's 72 percent.

655
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,154
Mine's 14 percent. Together, we own 80…

656
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,240
I mean, 86 percent.

657
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,201
Sang-su and I alone can

658
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,786
call meetings and make decisions

659
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,579
with the board and the shareholders.

660
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,289
Whose understanding do you need?

661
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,671
Work-life balance
seems to be a trendy term now.

662
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,632
Think of this as a special gift
from the two of us

663
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,175
for your work-life balance.

664
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,723
Okay.

665
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,518
Thank you.

666
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,994
This looks so good. Thanks, Dal-mi.

667
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,830
Seriously. Thank you, Dal-mi.

668
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,167
What's this for anyway?

669
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,171
I got this
for hitting the daily sales goal

670
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,714
of ten million won.

671
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,675
What? You set a new record.

672
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,093
Just 30,000 won?

673
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,553
And it's a gift certificate?

674
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,016
Gosh. As the saying goes,
"One sows and another reaps."

675
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,476
What did I tell you?

676
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,228
Why set a record?
They'll just make you work harder.

677
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,940
What? Are you trying to say
that Dal-mi is a pushover?

678
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,359
You're mean.

679
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,069
Why? She's right.

680
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,741
I worked hard and earned ten million won
for the company.

681
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,159
And look at me celebrating.

682
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,994
I am a pushover.

683
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,967
They'll renew your contract, right?

684
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,762
Come on. She set a sales record.

685
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,138
Of course, they'll renew it.

686
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,892
I wonder if they'll renew mine.

687
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,521
Buy us lunch when they do.

688
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,940
Don't you want to buy us lunch

689
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,234
to celebrate your own accomplishment?

690
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,818
Not really.

691
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,489
I'd prefer to mooch off
those who are successful.

692
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,871
Excuse me. Where is the CEO's office?

693
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,123
It's on the 32nd floor.

694
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,417
This only goes up to the 16th floor.

695
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,420
You have to take the elevator over there.

696
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,797
Thank you.

697
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,467
Dal-mi, buy us lunch

698
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,553
when your contract gets renewed, okay?

699
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,142
I'm sorry. I don't think that will happen.

700
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,982
I won't renew my contract.

701
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,858
What?

702
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,701
My goodness.

703
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,663
Okay, fine! Who scouted you?

704
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,206
We'll match the offer.

705
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,127
No need. And I have no complaints
about the company.

706
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,462
Then why are you leaving?

707
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,966
I want to be on the 32nd floor.

708
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,636
The elevator we take won't take me there.

709
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,055
I should get on one will.

710
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,348
That's why I'm quitting.

711
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:17,019
Please don't do this.
We won't be able to find your replacement.

712
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,688
You'll find someone soon--

713
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,023
No, we can't!

714
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:24,151
People with such a strong sense
of responsibility are rare nowadays!

715
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,905
Hold on.

716
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,033
-Take care.
-Wait.

717
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,784
Don't do this. This is unlike you.

718
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,119
What about the company?

719
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,456
Thank you for everything.

720
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,958
Wait, Dal-mi…

721
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,044
Take care. I'll be off, then.

722
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,005
Please persuade her to stay.

723
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,131
No, I won't.

724
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,341
I'm rooting for her.

725
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,095
Shall I buy you a gift
or take you out for dinner?

726
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,060
I'd like a gift.

727
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,354
A gift? What do you want?

728
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,609
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

729
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,516
AI SPEAKER JANG YEONG-SIL

730
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,600
Dong-cheon.

731
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,061
Why is the AI speaker, Yeong-sil,

732
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,688
still on the evaluation list?

733
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,109
Well, I tested it.

734
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,570
-It's accurate sometimes.
-"Sometimes" isn't good enough.

735
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,155
It always has to be accurate.

736
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,202
Even when it's wrong,
it's very charming in an odd way.

737
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,038
In school, there's always the dumb guy
who clowns around.

738
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,249
You know,
the ones that you can never hate.

739
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeong-sil is like that.

740
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,420
So? What's your point?

741
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,214
You insist on including him on the list?

742
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,133
Well, only if you're okay with it.

743
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,343
You told me I must check with you

744
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,345
before sending any texts to Dal-mi,

745
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,473
so I'm sending you the text
I got from her.

746
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,934
You know the money tree, right?

747
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,728
I got a nice one.

748
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,146
It's perfect for your office.

749
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,481
I'm headed to the address
on the business card.

750
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,899
How persistent!

751
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,651
What? I'm not being persistent.

752
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,528
I said I'd only do it if you approved.

753
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,946
I have to step out.

754
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,158
Okay. Yeong-sil's out, then.

755
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,117
No, hold on.

756
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,036
Keep him on the list.

757
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,205
What? Really?

758
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,207
Keep him?

759
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,795
What was that about? He confuses me.

760
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,423
He's softhearted but acts tough.

761
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,021
Hello? Nam Do-san speaking.

762
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,648
So where is Seo Dal-mi headed?

763
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,443
What's the address on your business card?

764
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,653
Our office. You've been here.

765
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,323
Damn it.

766
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,159
I have to say, she's so weird.

767
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,369
What's with her?
She's awfully unpredictable.

768
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,663
Well, we're trying to tidy up.

769
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,249
Tidying up won't make any difference!

770
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,669
Let's do this.

771
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,886
-Come on in.
-Over there.

772
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,893
-Jeez!
-Careful, please.

773
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,813
Damn it. Is this really necessary?

774
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,981
-Hurry.
-Move it.

775
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,274
Don't mind me.

776
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,904
-Let me--
-No, I'll help you.

777
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,199
-Are we getting paid?
-No idea.

778
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,578
1ST PLACE WINNER

779
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,498
Here.

780
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,584
SAMSAN TECH

781
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,008
Here. Wear this. Hurry up, okay?

782
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,555
-I even have to change my style?
-It's nice.

783
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,973
-Want to switch?
-No.

784
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,604
You're here.

785
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,531
Wow, this office is huge.

786
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,284
-Is this your office?
-Yes.

787
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,036
Cleaning this office must be a hassle.

788
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,455
I'm glad you know that.

789
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,626
I don't think I've met them before.

790
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,380
Say hi. They're my fellow co-founders
of Samsan Tech.

791
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,091
This is Yong-san and…

792
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,969
-I'm Chul-san.
-Yes, Chul-san.

793
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,263
-Hello.
-I've heard a lot about you.

794
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,474
Do-san, Yong-san, Chul-san.

795
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,767
Are you guys brothers?

796
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,519
No, we met in our college club.

797
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,313
-We're club mates.
-Do-san,

798
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,397
Yong-san, Chul-san.

799
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,982
Three Sans. Hence, Samsan Tech.

800
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:14,900
Genius, right?

801
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,279
That name is so lame.

802
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,867
So when did you guys start this company?

803
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,537
We started about three years ago.
So I guess it's been two years.

804
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,289
Is she a minister or something?

805
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,874
Is she here for an inspection?

806
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,669
Mr. Han, what are you doing here?

807
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,796
I want to ask myself that.

808
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,174
What are you doing here?

809
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,012
-Here, a gift for you.
-What? A gift?

810
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,639
It's a money tree.

811
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,723
It brings wealth.

812
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,016
I WISH YOU SUCCESS

813
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,436
Well, I don't think a tree
can bring you wealth…

814
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,813
Thank her.

815
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,274
Thank you.

816
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:02,948
So you came all the way here
to drop off that plant?

817
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,491
Yes.

818
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,828
And I have something to tell you.

819
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,539
What is it?

820
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,627
To tell you the truth,
I thought I'd be no match for my sister.

821
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,297
But now, I actually think
I can go up against her.

822
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,425
Well, I was a lot prettier
to begin with anyway.

823
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,135
-Goodness.
-As for our boyfriends,

824
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,221
I'm sure mine will be a better catch.

825
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,555
What the…

826
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,684
The problem is my status.
I fall behind on that front.

827
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,980
I blamed my age and the world for that,

828
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,524
but it's my own fault.

829
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,819
I'm embarrassed, and I feel lost.

830
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,446
Gosh, no. I feel lost, too.

831
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,407
Don't. There's an answer.

832
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,743
You're the answer to all my problems.

833
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,997
You're younger than my sister,
but you're so competent.

834
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:58,253
So I'm following in your footsteps.

835
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,047
My footsteps?

836
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,175
Yes. I quit my job today.

837
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,729
I'm going to start a company,
like you did.

838
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,233
-Like I did?
-Yes.

839
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,161
This is getting worse and worse.

840
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,589
-What are you doing here?
-Just as I expected.

841
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,800
Where is your secretary?
Why are you dragging that along yourself?

842
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,804
Sang-su is busy
with the board meeting today.

843
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:52,057
What about you? Where are you going?

844
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,560
You know that I'm leaving today.

845
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,649
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

846
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,078
Where to?

847
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,748
What's with you? You know where I'm going.

848
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,416
No, I don't.

849
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,628
Where? Incheon Airport?

850
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,006
Or your office?

851
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,765
The office.

852
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,768
Good. Be clever.
Go to the office and keep smiling.

853
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,603
Try to curry favor with your dad.

854
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,689
Then you can stop that idiot
from stealing everything from you.

855
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,198
Ms. Won In-jae
should be our chairperson today,

856
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,576
but I'm filling in
as she had to go to the US for work.

857
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,205
As you can see,
she's given me power of attorney.

858
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,456
SHAREHOLDER: WON IN-JAE

859
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,457
Standing up there,

860
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,042
he actually looks like the CEO.

861
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,544
Yes, he does.

862
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,796
Ms. Won

863
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,382
has expressed her wish to step down

864
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,260
in order to focus
on expanding the US branch.

865
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,594
It's unfortunate,

866
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,847
but is everyone here in support of this?

867
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,474
-Yes.
-Yes, we are.

868
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:21,604
Then all here is in support,
and there are no objections.

869
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,773
Then who here agrees

870
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:28,236
that I, Won Sang-su, should be appointed
the company's new CEO…

871
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,656
What's with him?

872
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,783
Everyone will agree.
It's as simple as that.

873
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,535
You didn't leave?

874
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,582
In-jae, I thought your flight was today.

875
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,168
I didn't want to miss out on the fun.

876
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,795
Stand tall.

877
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,839
Someone's obviously got your back,

878
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,549
so you should stand tall and proud.

879
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,138
Dad, I learned an expensive lesson
thanks to you.

880
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,141
If the start is easy then
it'll be taken away easily as well

881
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,851
and a CEO without shares

882
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,728
is no better than chewed-up gum.

883
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,814
In-jae.

884
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,650
Thank you for the invaluable lesson.

885
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,361
EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING

886
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,824
I'm not going to the US.

887
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,954
You can have that idiot
manage the US branch if you want.

888
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,123
What? "Idiot"?

889
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,919
"Idiot"?

890
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,962
Me?

891
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,677
Have you lost your mind?

892
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,889
Did you come here to throw a tantrum?

893
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,435
Yes. I've always wanted to
but never felt like

894
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,728
I had the right.

895
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,981
You need the right
to be able to throw a tantrum.

896
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,026
-What do you mean?
-If I do it while enjoying all the wealth,

897
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,237
people will say I have no shame
just like you.

898
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,155
What?

899
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,741
So I gave up everything.

900
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,494
I couldn't stand it anymore,
so I wanted to mess it all up.

901
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,914
And? Are you happy now?

902
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,124
That you got to say everything?

903
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,752
Yes, I'm very happy. I'm so relieved now.

904
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,797
You should do it too, Mom.
Then you'll understand.

905
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,134
You're relieved?

906
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,720
You worked so hard to grow the company!
How could you?

907
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,889
Do you feel free now?

908
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,226
No.

909
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,311
I feel shitty.

910
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,532
As for the length,
should I cut off this much?

911
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,159
Then how about here?

912
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,479
THE DREAM PLACE

913
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,807
ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS

914
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,976
FOR SAND BOX'S 12TH RESIDENCY PROGRAM

915
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,859
What is this?

916
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,070
The two million won.

917
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,823
After all, you did what I asked,
albeit clumsily.

918
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,659
Wow, it's cash.

919
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,953
How much longer
do we have to keep up this act?

920
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,497
It's done, no more.

921
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,167
Dal-mi's grandmother said
she's going to tell her the truth.

922
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,712
The truth? What do you mean?

923
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,258
The truth about everything,
from the letter to the party.

924
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,805
What? Then we didn't even need
to come here in the first place.

925
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,807
Exactly. She'll find out anyway.

926
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,309
-Why set this all up?
-I'm sorry.

927
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,229
I'm regretting it, too.

928
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,405
Mr. Han.

929
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,493
Does she have to tell Dal-mi the truth?

930
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,248
If we can keep fooling her,

931
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,959
she doesn't need to tell her.

932
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,460
But how?

933
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,213
You can't keep lying about everything.

934
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,756
He's right. That's too much.

935
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,966
That's a fraud.

936
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,347
We told Dal-mi two lies.

937
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,600
First, you wrote the letters 15 years ago,

938
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,893
but we told her it was me.

939
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,896
Second, we lied to her
that I'm a hotshot CEO.

940
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,733
As for the first lie,
all will be fine if you don't tell her.

941
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,110
The fact that you wrote
the letters, not me…

942
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,486
Can you keep that a secret?

943
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,196
I want to,

944
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,323
because I'm embarrassed I wrote them.

945
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,327
The problem is the second one.

946
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,582
But it won't be a problem anymore
if we get into Sand Box.

947
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,125
EXCELLENT

948
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,921
Are you giving me the finger now?

949
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,673
No.

950
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,221
Thanks for your help.
Let's not cross paths ever again.

951
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,392
Why do you keep assuming
that it won't work?

952
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,810
You didn't even see our demo.

953
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,687
-Our technology--
-I'm sure it's great.

954
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,356
You bragged about it
in your business plan.

955
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,816
But what's the use?

956
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,653
You have nothing to entice investors.
What is your business model?

957
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,822
And how will you generate
consistent profit?

958
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,407
You don't have a clear picture.

959
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,951
Getting tutoring support? A crash course?

960
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,453
With tricks like that,

961
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,332
you will not get into Sand Box.

962
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,460
It's all about potential.

963
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,213
You need to prove
at least an inkling of it!

964
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,803
At this rate,
Samsan Tech will go under in no time.

965
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,723
Stop wasting your family's money
and look for another job.

966
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,600
Stop crying or get out!

967
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,685
Why the heck are you crying? Stop it!

968
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,605
Guys, we did it.

969
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,357
-Did what?
-What is it?

970
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,402
CODA… We came in first place!

971
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,030
Hey, it's true. I see Samsan Tech here.
First place.

972
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,616
-We won first place!
-Not just first place.

973
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,660
We won by a huge margin!

974
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,496
CODA? You applied for that?

975
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,669
Will this do?
Does this give you an "inkling"?

976
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,013
My gosh.

977
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,812
-We worked so hard for this.
-Gosh.

978
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:28,281
ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS
FOR SAND BOX'S 12TH RESIDENCY PROGRAM

979
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,203
SAND BOX'S 12TH RESIDENCY PROJECT

980
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,038
A PLACE WHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE

981
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,420
I WANT TO LAUNCH MY START-UP BECAUSE

982
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,346
I WANT TO BE AN INSPIRING CEO

983
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,395
I WANT TO TAKE THE UPPER-FLOOR ELEVATOR

984
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,486
I DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS CHEWED-UP GUM

985
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,201
I WANT TO TURN A MISUNDERSTANDING
INTO REALITY

986
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,677
I WANT TO LAUNCH MY START-UP BECAUSE

987
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,323
I WANT TO REPAY MY DEBT

988
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,242
Mr. Han.

989
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,161
What are you doing here?

990
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,205
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

991
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,458
Are you launching

992
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,210
a start-up?

993
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,504
No, that's not why I'm here.

994
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,757
Then is there an applicant
you're interested in?

995
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,301
Well…

996
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,472
May I apply to be the mentor
for the 12th Residency Program?

997
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,809
What's gotten into you?

998
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,103
You said no
when I kept pestering you to do it.

999
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,022
There's a company I'm interested in.

1000
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,900
Is that right? Which team?

1001
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,321
-It's better that you don't know.
-Why is that?

1002
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,449
Because they won't get in.
I'm hoping they won't.

1003
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,495
Then they wouldn't need a mentor.

1004
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,580
Still, just in case.

1005
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,249
They might luck out and get in.

1006
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,044
Let's go.

1007
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,674
Tell me which team it is.

1008
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,056
A NEW BEGINNING FOR MY NEW FUTURE

1009
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:04,437
I WANT TO GET MY REVENGE

1010
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,148
All right. Relax, Do-san.

1011
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,442
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

1012
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,444
Let's do this.

1013
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:12,987
All right.

1014
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,281
We're rolling.

1015
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,461
Gosh, I can't do this.
Do we really have to do this?

1016
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,378
-Jeez.
-Cut.

1017
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,505
We can't be at the award ceremony,

1018
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,507
so we should at least send a video.

1019
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,469
Hey, just do it.
This is all your fault anyway.

1020
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,179
What? What did I do?

1021
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,098
You don't remember? Seriously?

1022
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,933
Let's say we do win a prize

1023
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,685
but can't find any flights.

1024
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,564
People want to invest in us,
but we're not there. How awful.

1025
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:51,901
We don't want such a tragedy
to happen, do we?

1026
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,028
Passport number.

1027
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,284
When I was about to book our flights
to San Francisco…

1028
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,746
-What?
-Lights off!

1029
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:04,789
Are they here?

1030
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,833
-If only you hadn't caused such a ruckus.
-Gosh!

1031
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,710
We'd be flying over the Pacific Ocean.

1032
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,379
Okay, fine.

1033
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,632
But this is too long.

1034
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,509
-Right?
-Yes.

1035
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,803
Leo Burnett, the advertising genius,

1036
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,554
said ads should be simple, memorable

1037
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,847
fun, and catchy.

1038
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,475
You know Leo Burnett!

1039
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,727
-That's my motto.
-All right.

1040
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,230
Then let's come up
with three impactful sentences.

1041
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,110
What do you think?

1042
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,572
I like it. Let's go with that, okay?

1043
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,617
-Let's go.
-Hey, relax.

1044
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,160
-Make it impactful.
-Yes.

1045
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,454
-You're ready, right?
-Yes.

1046
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,497
We're rolling.

1047
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,666
Go!

1048
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,508
That was nice. Well done.

1049
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,301
-That's it?
-In one go?

1050
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,719
-We're done?
-That was good.

1051
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:01,971
Just like the storyboard.

1052
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,139
We had a storyboard?

1053
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,850
Hey, we can't use this.

1054
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,768
Let's redo it. That was bad.

1055
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,645
No, editing can do wonders.

1056
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,814
I'm Leo Burnett of Korea.

1057
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,483
Do you want to see? Hold on.

1058
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,195
-Hey, can we really trust that guy?
-It's an honor to be the first…

1059
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,239
We are the future!

1060
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,449
I heard he got the silver button
from YouTube.

1061
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,534
He's shot commercials.

1062
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,370
Even that green screen
is giving me a bad feeling.

1063
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,040
Nice! That's it. We got it. Good stuff.

1064
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,584
-Cheon-ho.
-Yes?

1065
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,252
-It's pretty good.
-Right?

1066
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,296
-Gosh.
-I told you it's good.

1067
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,422
As for your pay…

1068
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,632
Don't worry. We're cousins.

1069
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,427
You didn't charge us
for the business cards. Let me pay.

1070
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,054
It's okay.
Call me whenever you need my help.

1071
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,849
Video production, editing,
PR, and marketing.

1072
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,809
Studio Jakdu has got you covered.

1073
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,645
-I hope we never have to call him.
-Yong-san.

1074
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,898
-Here, Chul-san.
-It's okay.

1075
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,232
Take it. It's nice.

1076
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,859
Yay!

1077
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,654
But I want one percent of your shares.
You know, right?

1078
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,741
Cheon-ho.

1079
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,285
-Thanks.
-Of course.

1080
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,454
Don't worry.
I'll make sure this looks dope.

1081
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,581
-Really?
-Yes, it already looks good.

1082
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,333
See that?

1083
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,003
-He's my cousin.
-Yes, clearly.

1084
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,173
Jakdu.

1085
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:23,052
Thank you for the umbrella, ma'am.
Have a good evening.

1086
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,720
-You, too!
-Take care.

1087
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:26,931
You, again?

1088
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,225
Go date someone
if you have time to visit me.

1089
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,728
Did you have dinner?

1090
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,772
Just talk here.

1091
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,565
Forget dinner. What is it?

1092
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,444
Will it take a while?

1093
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,882
By the way,
do we really need to send the video?

1094
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,511
It says on CODA's website
that we won first place.

1095
01:11:06,136 --> 01:11:07,388
Right, I know that.

1096
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,431
But that's not enough.

1097
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,559
That's right.
Our message should reach the world.

1098
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,895
-We want to be a global company.
-Exactly.

1099
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,563
-We're looking for investors.
-Yes!

1100
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,524
-But we have Mr. Han.
-Come on!

1101
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:22,027
Hey, we should be dealing
with Google and Amazon now.

1102
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,696
Han Ji-pyeong?

1103
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,115
Small fry like him
are simply not on our level.

1104
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:28,367
But I think…

1105
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,912
I still think
he'd be the best partner for us.

1106
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,915
Why do you think that?

1107
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:38,877
Because…

1108
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:47,261
Mr. Han and the three of us
have the same objective function.

1109
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:48,971
"Objective function"?

1110
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:50,723
All right.

1111
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:52,850
Look here.

1112
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,105
There are two neural networks,
the investor and us.

1113
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,941
Let's say the two networks
were to find the Nash equilibrium.

1114
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,237
The investor and us. Han Ji-pyeong.

1115
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,990
Samsan Tech.

1116
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,576
These are the two networks.

1117
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:14,747
-Right.
-Yes.

1118
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,332
-Are you listening?
-Yes.

1119
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:20,210
Okay. If they're too different, it'll be
hard to calculate the loss function,

1120
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,545
and learning won't be easy.

1121
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,881
But what if they have
the same objective function?

1122
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,301
Then you'll only need one loss function.

1123
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,219
And the learning process will be easier.

1124
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,387
That's it!

1125
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:36,268
This is why people always talk shit
about engineering majors.

1126
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,521
You're saying we can expect good results
since we share the same goal.

1127
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,232
Why say that
in such a convoluted, roundabout way?

1128
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,985
What is his goal?
Are you sure we share the same goal?

1129
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:46,987
SAMSAN TECH

1130
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,656
-Samsan Tech's success.
-Jeez, that fool…

1131
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,534
That's our goal, not his!

1132
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,703
No, he has the same goal as we do.

1133
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:55,746
On what grounds?

1134
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,709
I say that because we must succeed
to make sure Dal-mi won't be disappointed.

1135
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:05,130
And I know that he doesn't want
to disappoint Dal-mi, just like me.

1136
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,467
-Like you?
-Yes.

1137
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,053
I shouldn't tell Dal-mi the truth?

1138
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,680
I thought about it,
and it's not a big deal.

1139
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,849
All we have to do is keep our lips sealed

1140
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,393
and make Do-san a decent man.

1141
01:13:18,977 --> 01:13:20,604
Hey, that is a big deal.

1142
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:22,773
How are we going to do that? He's a loser.

1143
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,484
It won't be easy, but it's not impossible.

1144
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,361
And it's my specialty.

1145
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,363
Why go through such trouble? Forget it.

1146
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,656
Come on.

1147
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,908
Let me try.

1148
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,702
Why are you being like this?

1149
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:44,169
I can't even sleep these days
because of my 15-year-old debt.

1150
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:48,298
-That's why I'm doing this.
-It makes no sense.

1151
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,717
We met again less than a month ago.

1152
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,053
Have you been losing sleep all this time?

1153
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,014
You were fine for 15 years.
Why can't you sleep all of a sudden?

1154
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,141
Why is that?

1155
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,147
Why are you interrogating me?

1156
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,314
Because it's weird.

1157
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,066
Why do all that to help someone?

1158
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,404
Well, she said it felt like a dream.

1159
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,739
A dream that she'll remember forever.

1160
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:14,283
It made her so happy.

1161
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,661
You want to take it away from her?
Can you live with yourself after that?

1162
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,621
Gosh, I can't.

1163
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,123
Ji-pyeong.

1164
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:24,418
So let's not wake her up from that dream.
Don't take it all away.

1165
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,003
Just leave her be.

1166
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,256
The Nam Do-san in her dream.

1167
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,467
I'll make it a reality.

1168
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,636
-Are we good now?
-No, not yet.

1169
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,472
What now?

1170
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,766
If you weren't indebted to me…

1171
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,521
No, no way.

1172
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,530
Are you being like this because…

1173
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,534
Samsan Tech's success.

1174
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,995
Seo Dal-mi, Han Ji-pyeong, and Nam Do-san.

1175
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,331
Am I the only one who doesn't get it?

1176
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,374
As for Han Ji-pyeong…

1177
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,127
Sure, it seems like he and Seo Dal-mi
go back a long way.

1178
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,130
But what about you?

1179
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,509
-Me?
-She's practically a stranger to you.

1180
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:15,636
Why do you care
whether she's disappointed?

1181
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,720
It makes no sense.

1182
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,182
You're right.

1183
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,394
Still, I don't want her
to be disappointed.

1184
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,396
Right, but why?

1185
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:28,398
-Do-san.
-Yes?

1186
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,529
-Do you…
-Yes.

1187
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,865
That woman, Seo Dal-mi.

1188
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:39,993
Do you like her?

1189
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,841
Are you being like this because

1190
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,344
you have

1191
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,265
feelings for Dal-mi? Is that it?

1192
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:25,998
No.

1193
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:27,916
Yes.

1194
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,401
-Cheon-ho, when will it be on?
-Have some of this.

1195
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,904
-Hey, do better next time.
-Be quiet, will you?

1196
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,906
Eat up. Eat as much as you want.

1197
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,367
Those flowers are filling up
our tiny living room.

1198
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,993
My, look at those flowers.

1199
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,079
-Eat up.
-Kids, eat as much as you want.

1200
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,955
-Eat more.
-Yes, eat up.

1201
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,082
Look, it's on!

1202
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,917
-My gosh!
-It's on!

1203
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,377
Honey, it's on.

1204
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,046
Hold on.
So is that competition very famous?

1205
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:58,548
Gosh, it's no big deal.
Do you know what "AI" means?

1206
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:01,259
Artificial intelligence,
not avian influenza. Read this.

1207
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,011
-Here, read this.
-Goodness.

1208
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,305
We know what it is. Like AlphaGo.

1209
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,682
Yes, that's right.

1210
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,226
I heard it's like
the Olympics of that industry,

1211
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,560
but I don't know much.

1212
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,312
My, you must be so proud of him.

1213
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,897
Geum-jeong, you said

1214
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,650
you found wild ginseng
in your conception dream.

1215
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:18,568
Gosh, was mine about sweet potatoes?

1216
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,529
My son frustrates me so much.

1217
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,905
Don't glare at your mom.

1218
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:23,990
Go get your mom something to drink.

1219
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,867
They'll announce it now!

1220
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:26,993
Listen up!

1221
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,266
SAMSAN TECH

1222
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,018
-Well done!
-We did it!

1223
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,061
Great job, guys!

1224
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,897
-Nam Do-san!
-First place!

1225
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,107
-Yes!
-My gosh!

1226
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,359
Gosh, you must be so proud of your son.

1227
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,527
Congratulations.

1228
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,320
Guys, listen up! Do-san will speak!

1229
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,322
-Congratulations.
-You'll see Do-san now.

1230
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,463
SAMSAN TECH

1231
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,210
Ouch, I fell.

1232
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:03,048
That nutjob.

1233
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:05,926
This is annoying.

1234
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,228
NAM DO-SAN WINS FIRST PLACE

1235
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:17,187
Turn it off!

1236
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:22,526
-Oh, boy.
-Goodness.

1237
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,546
Turns out, Leo Burnett was our anti-fan.

1238
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,423
The green screen
gave me the heebie-jeebies.

1239
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,009
I told you I had a bad feeling about this.

1240
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:55,016
Don't come home for a while.

1241
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,977
I'm sorry, Do-san.

1242
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,659
Just cry. Cry all you want.

1243
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:40,937
Isn't that a place for people
with no money or connections?

1244
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,023
I ran into Dal-mi earlier.

1245
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:44,441
In those clothes?

1246
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:47,527
Do-san and I are going
on our first official date tomorrow.

1247
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,322
-Did you say this is the salad fork?
-The dessert fork!

1248
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,824
What's ordinary to one person
can be extraordinary to another.

1249
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,284
-Right.
-What?

1250
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:55,660
What?

1251
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:58,747
What do you like about me?

1252
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,917
Just give me some tips
whether it's on my style or business.

1253
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,502
What's your hotshot boyfriend doing here?

1254
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,963
Why are you here?

1255
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:12,052
