00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,196
EPISODE 15

2
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,125
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

3
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,252
Let's start.

4
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,717
Here we go.

5
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,376
All right. This is a historic moment
for Cheongmyeong Company

6
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,711
which Studio Jakdu will record.

7
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,421
Come and watch from over here.

8
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,006
Come on in. Come join us here!

9
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,789
This is just for a temporary permit.
Why come all the way here?

10
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,957
Got nothing else to do?

11
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,877
I wish.
We're so busy because of the bidding.

12
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,254
-Bidding?
-You don't know about it yet?

13
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,464
The City of Seonju is building
a smart city.

14
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,844
I know about it. DQ Group got the project.
The budget is over a trillion won.

15
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,722
They're looking
for an autonomous vehicle company,

16
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,724
and we're submitting a bid.

17
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,101
-I see.
-Step up your game.

18
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,312
If you keep working hard,
Cheongmyeong Company

19
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,148
will grow enough
to land such a large-scale project.

20
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,274
That's right.

21
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,276
As they say, a good start
is half the battle.

22
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,863
I know you will get this permit
thanks to our engineers.

23
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
What do you mean?

24
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,701
These twins here left the company
after setting everything up.

25
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,244
I can vouch for them,

26
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,956
so relax and enjoy. Just chill.

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,542
-We had to completely redo the system.
-What?

28
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,128
Come again? Redo what?

29
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,171
Why?

30
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:37,425
We really wanted to just build on what
you had created and take the easy route.

31
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,969
But we couldn't.

32
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,389
So many ghosts and no sensor fusion.

33
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,850
And the control functions
were all messed up as well.

34
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,605
I even got carsick and threw up
when the car was driving.

35
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,818
So we used our own algorithm
for the system.

36
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,155
We also had to completely change
the central system.

37
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,206
-They're going too fast.
-What makes them so confident?

38
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,916
What if they run into a problem?

39
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,774
A ghost.

40
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,030
Did it pick up a ghost?

41
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,573
No.

42
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,910
Oh, there's a cat.

43
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,216
It was a cat, not a ghost.

44
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,177
In other words, the system is good enough
to prevent roadkill.

45
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,140
The test is almost over.
Shall we wait for them at the finish line?

46
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,558
Sure, good idea.

47
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,060
It was a cat. A kitty cat, okay?

48
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,647
When is the bid deadline?

49
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,816
What? What bid? For what?

50
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,485
The smart city project
that DQ Group has landed.

51
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,655
I think we should also participate
in the bidding.

52
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,993
-All of a sudden?
-I also thought it'd be too sudden.

53
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,371
But after seeing that,
I no longer think so.

54
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,917
And that look on your faces

55
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,546
tells me that our system is better
than Morning AI's.

56
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,008
You can bluff anytime.
It doesn't cost a thing.

57
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,054
But if you have to pay the price,
it won't be cheap. You know that, right?

58
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,725
Yes. I know that well.

59
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,691
Hey, Yong-san.

60
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:08,279
Remember Do-san talking about developing
an autonomous driving system at 2STO?

61
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,572
Of course, I remember.

62
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,116
When Alex asked him
why he wanted to do that…

63
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,578
He said, "Just in case."

64
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,918
But he's turned that into reality.

65
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,086
Yes, he has.

66
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,380
"Just in case"?
What are you guys talking about?

67
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,548
Not telling you.

68
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,051
-Thank you.
-Well done.

69
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,594
Hey, guys!

70
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,347
-That was great!
-You rock!

71
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,229
-Let us carry you.
-Here, hop on!

72
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,105
-What?
-Hey, come on!

73
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,607
-Hey, Do-san!
-Come on!

74
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,443
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

75
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,115
-Nam Do-san!
-Nam Do-san!

76
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,077
-Nam Do-san!
-Nam Do-san!

77
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,413
-Seo Dal-mi!
-Seo Dal-mi!

78
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,416
-Seo Dal-mi!
-Seo Dal-mi!

79
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,876
-One, two, three!
-Two, three!

80
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,620
WINNER

81
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:55,177
A PRODUCT WITH ENOUGH FEATURES TO ATTRACT
EARLY ADOPTERS AND VALIDATE A PRODUCT IDEA

82
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,807
-You're nuts.
-We're at work now.

83
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,268
-You are crazy, Ms. Won.
-Seems like it.

84
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,020
-Yes, I agree.
-That's nonsense.

85
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,898
You know, the ink on our temporary permit
hasn't even dried yet.

86
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,985
But we passed the test with flying colors.

87
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,154
I think we have a shot at winning the bid.

88
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,118
I need to speak with you.

89
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,584
It's like telling a little kid
to take the CSAT.

90
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,336
I took it when I was in grade school.

91
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,380
Fine, anyone can take it.
But did you get into college as a kid?

92
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,633
-I did.
-What?

93
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,259
-You did?
-What?

94
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,927
I dropped out after a few months.

95
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,928
You freak.

96
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,600
Gosh, I don't even want
to try to understand that freak anymore.

97
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,320
What's gotten into you?
What's with this nonsense?

98
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,405
I don't think it's nonsense.

99
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,617
I believe a business can only grow
as large as the CEO's dreams.

100
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,037
Don't limit yourself. I hope you can keep
challenging yourself as a CEO.

101
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,248
Sometimes, foolhardy dreams
can become reality--

102
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,042
I guess Morning AI is bidding too.

103
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,339
That's right.

104
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,175
But I put Cheongmyeong Company's vision

105
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,719
-before my personal feelings--
-You don't want to lose.

106
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,514
Right, I don't.

107
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,100
I'd rather die than lose.

108
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,977
But Morning is their majority shareholder.

109
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
Chairman Won Du-jeong supports them.

110
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,773
Injae Company is
your majority shareholder.

111
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,024
You have my support.

112
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,069
Let's drop this.

113
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,862
You're not confident?

114
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,157
I am confident in our technology.

115
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,077
But we can't win that bidding war
with technology alone.

116
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,913
And we don't have time to fight a battle
that we will lose.

117
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,249
You've lost your spirit.

118
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,001
No, I'm just being careful.

119
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,878
You know.

120
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,091
I once lost my entire team
because of a reckless decision.

121
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,802
I don't want to lose them again.

122
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,722
That's my top priority.

123
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,360
CHUL-SAN ICED VANILLA LATTE LOVER

124
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,945
WE WON A TEMPORARY AUTONOMOUS
DRIVING PERMIT!

125
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,909
-No!
-Hey!

126
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,497
Enough already!

127
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,208
Everyone!

128
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,713
We finally got
the temporary operation permit.

129
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,924
Congratulate us by subscribing
to my channel and liking this video.

130
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,973
I must be going crazy.

131
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,397
HE GOT ALL THE CHAMPAGNE
TRYING TO PROTECT HER

132
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,525
What are these comments?

133
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,777
He was protecting me.
Why are they freaking out?

134
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,539
Can we add weather conditions to this?

135
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,751
To make the driving environment
a little more extreme.

136
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:20,007
As you know, Tarzan could use
some improvement on that front.

137
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,344
Chul-san, you're so cute when
you're having your iced vanilla latte.

138
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,721
Your sweet eyes
are going to give me diabetes.

139
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,223
Lee Chul-san is perfect.

140
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,391
Lee Chul-san is flawless.

141
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,645
Chul-san, you have nice teeth.
I'm a dentist.

142
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,647
Let me know if you need dental scaling!

143
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,858
If we set that up and do a simulation…

144
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,820
Sa-ha?

145
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,698
Are you listening?

146
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
Yes, of course.

147
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,079
Okay.

148
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,039
Let's see. Now--

149
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,209
-Hello!
-Oh, hello.

150
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,879
-Hello! Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

151
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,759
Here's the video we shot
on the day of the test.

152
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,428
It's a rough cut,
but check it out and let me know.

153
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,139
Thanks, Cheon-ho.
Are you not charging us again?

154
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,143
That's right. But can you guys give me
your feedback on something?

155
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,939
On what?

156
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,696
BELIEVE IT OR NOT

157
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,864
Here.

158
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,993
This is a fortune-telling app
based on tarot cards.

159
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,245
It's called Believe It or Not.

160
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,163
-Tarot cards?
-Sounds fun.

161
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,958
-It's a scam.
-Come on. It's all bullshit.

162
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,377
-We don't believe stuff like that.
-Give it a try.

163
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,713
It's extremely accurate.

164
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,548
And the app is synced with Yeong-sil.

165
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,384
So just pick what you want,
and he'll read it to you.

166
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,345
I'm sure some engineering majors
came up with that algorithm.

167
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,891
Sa-ha, don't buy into such superstitions.

168
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,227
How about a career reading?

169
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,479
-Oh, do you want to try?
-What?

170
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,149
-Do-san, you don't believe this stuff.
-Can I ask something like this?

171
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,444
Should we bid on the smart city project
or not?

172
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,654
Of course. You can ask it anything.

173
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,448
All right. Career. Okay.

174
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,701
Take your pick.

175
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,167
THIS IS FOR YOUR CAREER READING
CAREFULLY CHOOSE 1 CARD

176
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,501
PLEASE WAIT

177
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,840
You chose the Tower card.

178
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,093
They say that arrogance
comes before a fall.

179
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,804
And recklessness can make hard work
meaningless.

180
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,014
Be careful.

181
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,599
I'm getting goosebumps.

182
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,601
So we shouldn't do it?

183
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,603
I guess not.

184
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,772
I knew it.

185
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,191
Don't believe it.
It's just a superstition.

186
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,961
-Do you need to photocopy something?
-No.

187
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,505
Then what's up?

188
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,758
I have two favors to ask.

189
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,718
Favors?

190
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,930
Sure, what are they? Anything for you.

191
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,350
I want you to stop vlogging.

192
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,685
Stop vlogging?

193
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,398
Well, I have 50,000 subscribers.

194
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,857
Can I ask you why?

195
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,193
-You don't want to?
-It's not that.

196
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,115
Okay, I'll stop doing it.
I was going to stop anyway. Yes, I should.

197
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,159
Then what's the second one?

198
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,082
I hate when people are obviously
dating a co-worker,

199
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,042
so don't show it.

200
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,461
Gosh, I wouldn't want
to make a big deal out of it.

201
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,506
What?

202
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,510
What do you mean?

203
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,554
I don't want anyone to know

204
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,764
that we're dating.

205
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,480
Sa-ha.

206
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,442
Is this another prank?

207
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,110
Then I'd really be…

208
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,293
You can do that for me, right?

209
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,588
Yes.

210
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,842
I… I won't show it.

211
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,762
Never. You have my word.

212
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,600
Okay, see you.

213
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,769
See you.

214
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,625
Oh, my heart…

215
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,046
LOOKING FOR PARTNERS
FOR SELF-DRIVING PLATFORM

216
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,093
Why did In-jae have to bring it up?
It keeps bothering me.

217
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,888
She goes bonkers every time
she hears anything about Morning Group.

218
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,307
She completely forgets
that she's no match for them.

219
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,101
You don't like to lose either.

220
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,853
Right, I don't.
But that's just your personal feeling.

221
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,273
Since I'm a CEO,
I should make a rational decision.

222
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,193
I think you could be a mentor now.

223
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,738
LOOKING FOR PARTNERS
FOR SELF-DRIVING PLATFORM

224
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,074
I'm getting goosebumps.

225
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,659
So we shouldn't do it?

226
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,495
I guess not. I knew it.

227
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,039
Don't believe it.
It's just a superstition.

228
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,586
Director Han.

229
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,131
I'm asking just in case.

230
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,007
It's unlikely.

231
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,427
Still. If we got lucky…

232
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,722
Like If we got unbelievably lucky,

233
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,433
-do you think we could win--
-No.

234
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,978
It's just a waste of time

235
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,523
and resources to try something
you know that you will fail.

236
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,902
Right?

237
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,281
I knew you'd say that.

238
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,161
-Did you eat everything?
-Oh, right.

239
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,539
Tell your grandma to stop sending me food.

240
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,166
I have no room left in my fridge.

241
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,959
She'll be happy to hear that.

242
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,129
Fattening you up
is her only joy these days.

243
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,427
Oh, I'll carry this.
You'll leave it in your car, right?

244
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,469
Yes.

245
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,103
Where did you park?

246
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,105
On B4.

247
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,775
Oh, my grandma wanted me to ask you
what kinds of side dishes you like.

248
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
Gosh, it's really okay.

249
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,237
My body fat percentage is soaring.

250
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,950
Her goal is making sure
your body-fat percentage goes over 20.

251
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,495
Over 20 percent?
That's more than what pigs have.

252
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,624
Really? Pigs have less than
20 percent body fat?

253
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,101
You're not getting in?

254
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,730
I am.

255
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,615
-What floor?
-B4.

256
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,175
Kongjaban.

257
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,053
Sorry?

258
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,390
Next time, ask your grandma
to make some kongjaban for me.

259
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,642
I love kongjaban.

260
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,483
Okay, will do.

261
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,659
What's going on?

262
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,495
Is it broken?

263
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,170
Hello, I'm in the elevator
in Sand Box's main building.

264
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,880
The elevator suddenly stopped.

265
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,341
-The main building? We'll be right there.
-Thank you.

266
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,577
Sa-ha, do you know how to solve anagrams?

267
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,454
Yes, I did it a lot when I was little.

268
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,998
ANAGRAM: USING LETTERS OF ONE WORD
TO CREATE OTHER WORDS

269
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,252
Can you think of any words
using these letters?

270
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,962
What is this?

271
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,007
It's a character string
from the ransomware hostname.

272
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,760
I think this means something.

273
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,844
Really?

274
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,770
There's also pastel, monorail.

275
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,779
Also, trampoline works.

276
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,699
That sounds really fun.

277
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,493
Let me join you guys.

278
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,994
Do you know what anagrams are?

279
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,330
Why don't you teach me?

280
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,456
Chul-san.

281
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,084
I can't build on the file you sent.
Can you take a look?

282
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,211
I'll do it later. This is more urgent now.

283
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,962
Hey, that's more urgent.

284
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,635
Why isn't it working?

285
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,513
Did you check the README?

286
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,242
When will they get here?

287
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,037
I wonder too.
This is taking longer than I thought.

288
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,876
LOOKING FOR PARTNERS
FOR SELF-DRIVING PLATFORM

289
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,467
-Dal-mi.
-Yes?

290
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,470
You know…

291
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,141
we should put in a bid

292
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,518
for the self-driving platform.

293
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,570
You know that this isn't something
we can tackle.

294
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,655
And it's highly unlikely
that we'll get it.

295
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,283
I know. I don't expect us to get it.

296
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,410
-Still, we should--
-Why bother?

297
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,999
It's a lot of work for something
you don't expect to succeed at.

298
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,501
That's why we should do it.

299
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,547
That way, it'll be easier next time.

300
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,432
-Well…
-So, like a practice game?

301
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,768
You want to put off everything else
to come up

302
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,354
with a proposal and a whole new program
for this project

303
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,691
and even prepare for the tech evaluation
just for practice?

304
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,445
That's a lot of time and energy.
If you don't get it--

305
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,071
It'll be a learning experience.

306
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,741
You pass failure on your way to success.

307
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,576
We'll build experience--

308
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,828
That's just being reckless.

309
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,419
What's with you two?

310
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,421
Why talk about work here?

311
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,797
"Reckless"?

312
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,677
Right. You need to keep digging around
to find a good lot.

313
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,887
We'll keep digging and--

314
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,972
The wrong order can cost you your life.

315
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,808
I told you before.

316
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,936
If you sail off without a map, you'll die.

317
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,480
Be it a typhoon or a shark.
You will die either way.

318
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,399
Did you forget?

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,860
How could I?

320
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,863
Of course, I remember.

321
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,658
Sailing off without a map.

322
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,916
Let's do it.

323
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,043
I was very excited
when you told us that idea.

324
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,255
You're reckless.

325
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,091
Well, we'll just get lost.

326
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,678
"Sail off without a map." Remember?

327
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,721
But to me,

328
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,018
sailing off without a map was marvelous.

329
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,564
I might've failed, but I have no regrets.

330
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,653
Never did and never will.

331
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,534
-Look, Do-san.
-I know.

332
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,413
Like you said, sailing off without a map
could cost me my life.

333
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,125
But I could also survive.

334
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,462
And people like that become trailblazers.

335
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,930
Are you all right?

336
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,892
Thank you.

337
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,082
I'm sorry.
I put you in a difficult position.

338
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,419
Yes.

339
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,505
Pretend you never heard what I said.

340
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,674
It was just noise.

341
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,344
How could I do that
when I heard everything you said?

342
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,430
Dal-mi.

343
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,895
I will support your decision
no matter what you decide to do.

344
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,316
I just don't want your decision
to be hindered by us.

345
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,780
Even if we fail, it won't affect the team.

346
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,704
You must've overheard
my conversation with In-jae.

347
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:46,998
Yes.

348
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,001
So don't worry about that, okay?

349
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,879
The past three years have changed me.

350
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,090
I'm a lot more careful now.

351
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,133
I've changed too.

352
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,469
I'm much stronger now.

353
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,361
LOOKING FOR PARTNERS
FOR SELF-DRIVING PLATFORM

354
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,626
Dal-mi.

355
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,713
You know… we should put in a bid

356
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,799
for the self-driving platform.

357
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,813
BELIEVE IT OR NOT

358
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,112
You chose the Seven of Swords card.

359
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,865
You are holding the blade, not the grip.

360
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,700
You may get hurt.

361
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,660
Do not make any rash decisions.

362
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,874
Right, of course. I agree.

363
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,589
Why don't I try one more time?

364
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,799
You chose the Seven of Swords card.

365
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,762
You chose the Seven of Swords--

366
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,805
Fine.

367
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,100
-Just once more.
-You chose the Seven of--

368
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,437
For one last time.

369
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,648
You chose the Seven of Swords card.

370
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,583
You look tired.
Did you not sleep well last night?

371
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,460
Does it show?

372
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,921
Gosh, I can't let it show.

373
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,255
Is something bothering you?

374
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,424
No, it's nothing.

375
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,560
Where's Grandma? Is she still in bed?

376
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,603
Yes.

377
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,980
She keeps sleeping more and more.

378
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,150
Should we try a new tonic?

379
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,319
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

380
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,447
You will take care of it?

381
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,533
That worries me even more.

382
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,409
What will you do?

383
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,996
Don't you worry. Just eat your breakfast.

00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,653
Looks good.

390
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,041
Apollon and Artemis also work.

391
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,251
Oh, you're right.

392
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,546
Sa-ha, you're an anagram master.

393
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,934
Is this enough?

394
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,645
No, keep going. I think we're close.

395
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,276
Stop playing that game.
Let's get some work done.

396
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,486
Hey, this isn't a game.

397
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,406
This could lead us to the culprit
behind the ransomware attack.

398
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,741
This is serious.

399
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,077
Okay. I'm serious too.

400
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,163
Very serious.

401
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,751
Hey, can you stop that?

402
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,598
Mr. Nam.

403
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,059
Yes?

404
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,103
There's something
you need to return to me.

405
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,230
-What?
-The letter.

406
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,400
You still have that, right?
I left it in your rooftop office.

407
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,820
-Yes.
-That letter is mine.

408
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,114
You don't need it anymore.

409
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,824
I want it back.

410
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,619
You also have something
that belongs to me.

411
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,206
Me? Something that belongs to you?

412
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,750
Look, Mr. Nam.

413
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,586
Unlike you, I hate to keep things

414
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,630
-that aren't mine--
-The money tree.

415
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,384
Dal-mi got that for me.

416
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,177
I want it back.

417
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,847
Sure.

418
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,475
Let's swap them and call it an end.

419
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,521
Sure, sounds good.
When would you like it back?

420
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,689
-Now.
-Right now?

421
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,149
-Why? You don't want to?
-No, sounds great. Let's go.

DAD GOT ME A BEAUTIFUL MUSIC BOX
FOR MY NINTH BIRTHDAY

427
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,736
Do-san, you're my pretty music box.

428
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,573
I hope you know that.

429
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,287
I bet you have a lovely melody.

430
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,664
I'm sure of it.

431
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,556
Hello?

432
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,477
-Where are you?
-I'm home.

433
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,145
Where should we meet?

434
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,358
I don't need the tree.

435
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,861
I'm keeping the letter.

436
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,030
What? Hey, Mr. Nam--

437
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,205
Mr. Nam. Do-san…

438
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,082
Hey!

439
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,091
What is this?

440
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:39,095
I got a little bit of alimony, you know.

441
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:44,058
-So consider this my rent…
-My gosh.

442
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,685
Is this money?

443
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,604
Cash? How much?

444
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,398
No, it's not cash.

445
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,567
It's better than cash.

446
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,819
Better than cash? What could it be?

447
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,239
-Is it a check?
-No.

448
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,909
Mother, I got you a commercial space

449
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,453
for your corn dog shop!

450
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,164
Why?

451
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,332
It'll be good for both of us.

452
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,127
Working together will help us
improve our relationship.

453
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,546
Gosh, forget it. Go cancel this now.

454
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,382
I can't.

455
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,384
I already paid the deposit.

456
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,386
My gosh, have you lost your mind?

457
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,929
Why on earth did you do this?

458
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,682
Because I'm counting on you, Mother.

459
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,059
Mother, just tell me what to do.

460
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,520
I'll make and sell them.
I'll do all the work.

461
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,397
Gosh, that terrifies me.

462
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,192
Hey, what can you even do?

463
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,320
Whatever! I can't do this. I refuse.

464
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,409
All right, then.
I guess I'll do this alone.

465
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,493
What?

466
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,748
Hey, A-hyeon.

467
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,336
After spilling the oil
and causing trouble a few times,

468
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,172
I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.
I'm not a complete idiot.

469
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,257
Right?

470
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,929
Gosh, that fool. Hey!

471
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,682
What do I do? A corn dog shop with her?
My goodness.

472
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,227
I can't even see anything.

473
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,241
DIRECTOR HAN JI-PYEONG

474
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,499
Hey, Do-san. Are you home?

475
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,793
Yes. I'm here, Dad.

476
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,796
You're back.

477
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,011
Director Han.

478
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,930
I tried calling, but you didn't pick up.

479
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,683
I wasn't sure what to do,
so I decided to stop by

480
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,851
and I ran into your father.

481
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,687
Oh, hello.

482
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,730
Hello.

483
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,734
-Who is he?
-He and Do-san are very close.

484
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,362
-You said you're his mentor, right?
-That's correct.

485
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,156
I'm sorry, I should've come by
to introduce myself sooner.

486
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,617
Why would you visit my parents?

487
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,287
He said he's here
to collect something from you.

488
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,208
No, that's not true.

489
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,210
Come on. You know what it is.

490
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,921
Here. Gosh, don't drop it.

491
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,009
We were supposed to do a swap,
but I guess he forgot.

492
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,053
-He's forgetful.
-No, that's not true.

493
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,556
My gosh, that's a money tree.

494
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,643
It's big! I guess he's giving it to you
to wish you great prosperity.

495
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,313
Mom, it's not like this tree
can help me earn more money.

496
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,190
Hey, don't be rude.

497
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,818
Have you eaten yet?

498
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,153
-It's okay, Mom.
-Not yet.

499
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,578
Do you drink?

500
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,289
I'm not trying to brag,

501
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,542
but I made these myself
with herbs that I handpicked.

502
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,420
There's more over there. Down here too.

503
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,630
Let's see. Over here, I've got…

504
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,091
This is arrowroot wine,
with the energy of the earth.

505
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,762
This sweet mandarin melon berry wine will
get you drunk before you even know it.

506
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,472
Ginseng wine's good for immunity.

507
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,600
Having digestive problems?
Then you need this plum wine.

508
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,686
All men know about this.
The ultimate stamina booster,

509
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,523
bushclover wine.
I've got all sorts of herbal wines here.

510
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,401
Thank you for the offer,
but I'll pass. I--

511
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,487
He can't drink. He can't control himself.

512
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,405
No, that's not true.

513
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,949
Unlike someone, I behave myself
even when I'm drunk.

514
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,916
I behave myself too.

515
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,880
-All right, cheers!
-Cheers.

516
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,472
-Here, sir.
-Gosh, it's okay.

517
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,932
I shouldn't drink anymore.

518
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,227
Director Han, aren't you full?

519
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,688
What should we drink to aid digestion?

520
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,982
-Plum wine!
-Plum wine!

521
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,568
Sir, we want plum wine!

522
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,613
Honey, let's go to bed.

523
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,740
These two will drink all night.

524
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,492
Yes, let's go to bed.

525
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,661
They're obviously very close.

526
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,870
-Plum wine.
-Let's go.

527
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,541
Here's the plum wine.

528
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,418
Open the lid.

529
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,462
But don't touch the bushclover wine.

530
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,632
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

531
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,301
Don't touch the bushclover wine…

532
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,686
You can't even open that? Jeez.

533
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,062
Why won't this open?

534
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,606
Pass it over. Let me try.

535
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,861
If I open this,

536
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,155
give me back the letter.

537
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,282
Okay?

538
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,034
Gosh, you can't even open this?

539
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,883
Let's just drink something else.
Bring something else.

540
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,178
Director Han. You know,

541
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,932
I'm really curious about something.

542
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,726
About what?

543
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,270
About that letter.

544
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,774
Ms. Choi told me

545
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,694
that you saw my name in the newspaper.

546
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,531
You used my name because I looked smart

547
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,619
and kind.

548
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,872
No, no. I'll tell you the real reason.

549
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,919
I did it out of envy.

550
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,550
I saw your parents congratulating you
on winning the medal

551
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,470
and taking photos with you on TV.

552
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,931
And I…

553
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,727
really envied your life.

554
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,526
That's why I used your name.

555
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,364
I envied you a lot.

556
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:14,949
Me? Why?

557
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,493
Why would you envy me?

558
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,703
Because of my river-view apartment?
My car?

559
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,330
Or my watch?

560
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,791
No.

561
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,585
A long time ago,

562
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,298
I asked Dal-mi

563
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,928
why she liked me.

564
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,266
And this was her answer.

565
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,729
First of all, you're my first love.

566
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,482
That's you.

567
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,153
So I asked her again, and she said…

568
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:58,909
Your letters comforted me for a long time.

569
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,620
That was also you.

570
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,208
So I asked her again,

571
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,502
and she finally

572
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,007
said something that was actually about me.

573
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,511
You have nice, big hands.

574
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,516
She likes me because I have big hands.

575
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,277
That's it.

576
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,491
So I tried very hard
to outdo all the memories

577
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,871
that you two share

578
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,335
with this one thing alone,

579
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,801
but it certainly wasn't enough.

580
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,809
If you know that,
will you give up already?

581
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,561
That I can't do.

582
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,271
What, then?

583
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,150
You'll love her forever
knowing it won't be reciprocated?

584
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,695
Yes.

585
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,241
I'll love her forever.

586
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,184
Sa-ha.

587
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,063
What did you say you did
to overcome your insomnia?

588
00:44:55,067 --> 00:45:01,156
The number pi is 3.141…

589
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,118
Jeez, what is that?

590
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,330
Sailing off without a map was marvelous.

591
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,707
I might've failed, but I have no regrets.

592
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,670
Never did and never will.

593
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,385
I will support your decision
no matter what you decide to do.

594
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,347
I just don't want your decision
to be hindered by us.

595
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,822
The sun's coming up.

596
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,301
-Grandma.
-Yes?

597
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,303
What are you doing this early?

598
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,264
Well, your mom caused big trouble.

599
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,057
I stayed up all night to sort it out.

600
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,102
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

601
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,481
She signed a lease for a commercial space.

602
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,899
To open a corn dog shop.

603
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,693
Mom said that? What's she counting on?

604
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,528
My point, exactly.

605
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,739
She said she's counting on me.

606
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:30,245
So you stayed up all night
to make the batter?

607
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,623
I'm so worried that I can't even sleep.

608
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,375
Why on earth did she do such a thing?

609
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,669
And she's sound asleep
after doing this to me.

610
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,465
So you're going to help her?

611
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,635
What can I do? Someone has to sort it out.

612
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,887
Hold on.

613
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,681
Hey, how does this look?

614
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,767
-It's perfect.
-Really?

615
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,317
-Grandma.
-Yes.

616
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,902
I think the shop will do well.

617
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,531
How? I can't even see.

618
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,366
It won't work.

619
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,410
Still, we should try.
What can I do, you know?

620
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,540
Oh, boy.

621
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,671
Grandma.

622
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,175
-Thank you.
-What? For what?

623
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,515
-I found my answer.
-What?

624
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,479
Thanks, Grandma.

625
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,118
Yeong-sil.

626
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,704
Yeong-sil, what time is it?

627
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,791
Yeong-sil.

628
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,304
What is this place?

629
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,472
Where am I?

630
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,517
What should we drink to aid digestion?

631
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,728
-Plum wine!
-Plum wine!

632
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,229
Crap.

633
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,189
What is this?

634
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,109
Checkered! Checkered pajamas.

635
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,027
Check!

636
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,781
Gosh, I'm going to puke. For real.

637
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,910
Why do I remember everything?

638
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,246
I drank more than enough to black out.

639
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,540
Why do I remember such useless details?

640
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,210
She likes me because I have big hands.

641
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,590
That's it.

642
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,559
I tried to feel her out,

643
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,269
and she's not interested in you.

644
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,356
She likes men with big hands.

645
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,319
The hands? That's her type?

646
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:31,134
Should I put chili peppers
in the pollack soup or not?

647
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,720
Does he like spicy food?

648
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,180
Yes, I think so.

649
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,641
Mom, do we have kongjaban?

650
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,227
Yes, in the container with the blue lid.

651
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,770
Why do you need kongjaban?

652
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,065
Director Han likes it.
I want to pack some for him to take home.

653
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,373
You're already up?
Have some hangover soup.

654
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,874
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

655
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,753
I packed some kongjaban
for you to take home.

656
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,131
-Our kongjaban is so good.
-I don't like kongjaban.

657
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,385
-In the elevator, you said--
-Have you no pride?

658
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,764
Why are you getting angry?

659
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,185
I'm taking the letter and the tree.

660
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,020
What?

661
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,275
That's not fair.
We were supposed to do a swap.

662
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,860
No. Even then, it's my loss.

663
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,863
Your loss? What do you mean?

664
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,906
Mr. Nam.

665
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,082
I was going to keep playing dumb,
knowing how dull-witted you are.

666
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,794
But I can't.

667
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,885
Listen up. I won't say it twice.

668
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,261
It's okay.

669
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,265
This is enough.

670
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,282
I WANT TO LAUNCH MY START-UP BECAUSE

671
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,255
What are you doing here?

672
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,094
Just thinking about my first day here.

673
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,556
You wrote one too, right?

674
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,268
Yes, I did.

675
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,690
What is the probability of me
finding the one that you wrote?

676
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,317
Not sure.

677
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,905
I think there are about 5,000 of these,
so maybe around 0.0002 percent?

678
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:45,245
Would the probability of us
winning the bid be around that as well?

679
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,457
Let's do this.

680
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,045
If I manage to find yours in one minute,

681
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,257
we will bid on that project.

682
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,677
But this has nothing to do with that.

683
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,470
Starting now.

684
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,349
Which side? Just tell me that.

685
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,102
This side, right?

686
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,658
Listen up. I won't say it twice.

687
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,161
Stop feeling inferior to me.

688
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,663
Work on your self-esteem

689
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,832
and look at Dal-mi again.

690
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,959
Then you'll know

691
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,921
who she really likes.

692
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,806
With those hands alone,

693
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,809
you beat our memories.

694
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,733
You're tall, so maybe it's up there?

695
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,332
This is mine.

696
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,835
We found it, so let's do it.

697
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,839
But I was supposed to find it.

698
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,182
Does this mean…

699
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,227
Dal-mi.

700
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,565
Why do you like me?

701
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,530
I'm not your first love,

702
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,867
and I didn't write those letters.

703
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,622
I lied to you

704
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,958
and hurt you.

705
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:01,297
I can't think of a single reason
why you'd like me.

706
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,261
Just my hands. That's it.

707
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,098
Why do you like me?

708
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,397
I…

709
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,776
I…

710
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,410
I don't know.

711
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,830
Why do you keep asking me this question?

712
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,586
Why do you like me?

713
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,516
Do I need a reason?

714
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,440
I just like you.
I don't need a reason to like you.

715
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,282
Because it's you.

716
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,203
You're the reason.

717
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,665
That's all there is to it.

718
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,752
Thank you.

719
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,531
I WANT TO TURN A MISUNDERSTANDING
INTO REALITY

720
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,959
Sa-ha, I thought of a few more at home.

721
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,255
Sorry.

722
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,425
-My gosh.
-What are you doing?

723
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,011
Nothing. I'll pick it up for you.

724
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,809
Why does it keep running away?

725
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,352
Does it have feet or something?

726
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:11,070
Hey, are you upset with me
about something?

727
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,242
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

728
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,494
-No.
-Yes.

729
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,413
-You are upset with me.
-No, I'm not.

730
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,582
-You are.
-I said I'm not!

731
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,541
-You are!
-No.

732
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,667
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

733
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,877
What's this?

734
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,212
-Hey.
-You're upset with me.

735
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,256
-They're being so childish.
-What is this?

736
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,552
Yong-san is trying to solve the anagram
to find the ransomware culprit.

737
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,896
What is this?

738
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,315
Why?

739
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:58,117
I received the adoption dissolution order
from the court.

740
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,621
Now, you're divorced
and even the adoption has been dissolved.

741
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,374
They're no longer our family,
so just forget about them.

742
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,335
She even named the company
after her father. Jeez.

743
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,920
Cheongmyeong Company?

744
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,256
Don't even worry.

745
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,550
It's just a tiny start-up.

746
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,635
Do you kill flies because they're big?

747
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,763
We slap them because they're annoying.

748
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,266
Sang-su.

749
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:25,061
I do not want to see them forgetting
their place and acting up again.

750
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,814
What should we do, then?

751
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,693
Seo Dal-mi threatened us
once before, right?

752
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,529
I think we should do the same.

753
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,825
Reporters have the power
to ruin a company's image.

754
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,495
And once your image is ruined,
it takes time and money to restore it.

755
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,914
Okay.

756
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,086
Meet Mr. Choi at Hyungju Daily.

757
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:54,507
We recently bought a lot of ad space,
so he'll be happy to help us out.

758
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,260
HYUNGJU DAILY
CHOI JI-HAENG

759
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,512
Okay, Dad.

760
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,607
Hey.

761
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,234
I'm here.
I'll go through it when I get in.

762
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,778
But Ms. Seo is waiting for you here now.

763
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,957
Dong-cheon, I want to go through it
somewhere quiet if possible.

764
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,168
Can you email me the IR stuff?

765
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,753
Then what about Ms. Seo?

766
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,762
That's right. I forgot you had to step out
for that meeting today.

767
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,514
Got it. I'll let her know. Okay.

768
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,312
I'm sorry, Ms. Seo.

769
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,439
Director Han has a meeting elsewhere.

770
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,692
Yes, I heard everything. It's okay.

771
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,071
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

772
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,364
-Have a good day.
-You too.

773
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,554
PARK DONG-CHEON

774
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,979
-Hey, what's up?
-Ms. Seo left.

775
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,440
But she totally knows
that you're avoiding her.

776
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,445
I'll be there in a minute.

777
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,376
Han Ji-pyeong, you're such a loser.

778
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,023
I didn't know you were here.

779
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,901
I wanted to go through some stuff quietly.

780
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,445
Come in. I was about to leave.

781
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:23,990
You are avoiding me.

782
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,000
Because I know what you'll say.

783
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:49,974
I always thought I'd be able to act cool
in situations like this.

784
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,020
Turns out I'm a loser after all.

785
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,439
And I am not okay.

786
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,612
Director Han.

787
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,156
But if I felt okay now,

788
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,452
that would mean I didn't actually
like you that much.

789
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,082
I'm sorry.

790
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,714
I'm sorry too.

791
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:26,594
I'm afraid I'll act like a loser
for quite a while.

792
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,648
I wanted to tell you

793
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,567
that we have decided

794
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,780
to bid on the project.

795
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,703
Okay. You made a good decision.

796
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,902
So? Are you going to do it?

797
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:29,282
Yes, that's the plan.
But I can't guarantee we'll get the bid.

798
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,742
It'd be weird if you did.

799
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:35,162
Just think of the entire process
as MVP testing.

800
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,873
You have to share

801
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,792
all your documents and experience
with me, okay?

802
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,085
Yes, don't you worry.

803
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,506
Can you believe it? This is you.

804
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,092
No, I can't.

805
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,471
This girl's so ugly.

806
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,018
No, they made her way too pretty.

807
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,229
No, I look much better in person.

808
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,690
No. Your head was a lot bigger than that.

809
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,693
-What? Am I an insect?
-Your head was this big.

810
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,236
No, your head was bigger.

811
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,614
Right. I had a big head too.

812
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,199
-You had a big nose.
-What? What do you mean?

813
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,576
I have a high nose bridge.

814
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,162
No, you don't. You had a chubby nose.

815
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,835
What? There are no cars in front of us.
Why is it suddenly slowing down?

816
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,588
There must be a glitch
with the detection logic.

817
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,590
Let's check the route again.

818
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,425
We'll fix it if this happens again.

819
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,183
Can we get some data from DQ Group?

820
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,394
We should revise the UI design,
but I'm not sure how.

821
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,897
It's probably confidential,

822
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,484
but let me find out. I'll look into it.

823
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,709
Gosh, you didn't have to buy this.

824
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,838
FOR YOUR JOINTS, FOR YOUR HEALTH

825
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,341
I heard this is very good for the knee.

826
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,302
You have to protect your knees
if you want to work at the shop.

827
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:58,681
-Don't forget to take this every day.
-Okay.

828
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,601
Do you have an important appointment
or something?

829
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,145
Yes, I do.

830
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,897
-Is the batter ready?
-Yes.

831
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,569
It's our first day.
I wonder if we'll be busy.

832
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,114
Gosh, why is my heart pounding like this?

833
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,949
Mother.

834
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,619
You had an extra shot of espresso
in your coffee this morning.

835
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,079
That's why.

836
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,540
A-hyeon.

837
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,502
-You'll live a long life.
-How do you know?

838
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,421
Because I bad-mouth you a lot.

839
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,590
Gosh, Mother.

840
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,426
Autumn's here.

841
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:38,971
Right? Don't you smell
the stinky ginkgo nuts?

842
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,098
No, I don't.

843
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,104
Grandma looks like
a beautiful cosmos flower in full bloom.

844
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,690
Oh, please.

845
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:56,155
-Oh, I'll be late. I'm heading out.
-All right.

846
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,831
Thanks, Mom.

847
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,714
-See you later!
-Bye!

848
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,974
INFO SESSION FOR SEONJU SMART CITY'S
SELF-DRIVING PLATFORM

849
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,070
I didn't think they'd jump the gun,
but they're really participating.

850
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,535
Is that bravery?

851
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,995
No, they just don't know their place.

852
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,804
Mr. Choi told me a lot about you.

853
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,892
I wish I was here to relay good news,

854
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,520
but I'm here to speak ill
of another company.

855
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,897
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

856
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,233
Don't be.

857
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,736
We live off trash talk and accusations
after all.

858
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,530
We're very used to this.

859
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:22,032
Then I trust that
you'll take good care of this.

860
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,743
Of course. We look forward
to our continued partnership.

861
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,872
Newspapers make profits from ads,
you know.

862
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,083
You don't need to be embarrassed.

863
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,752
If it's a fact,
you're serving the common good.

864
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,546
It's a fact. That I can guarantee.

865
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,091
I'm sure you know about
the smart city project DQ Group landed

866
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,719
for 1.8 trillion won.

867
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,640
Yes, we sure do. Nice introduction.

868
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:50,769
They're doing a bid to select
a self-driving car company,

869
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,397
and I know of a company
that's participating.

870
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,734
It's a start-up,
so you may not have heard of it.

871
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,320
It's called Cheongmyeong Company.

872
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,281
Cheongmyeong Company?

873
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,835
Hello.

874
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,213
Is this Cheongmyeong Company?

875
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,882
Yes, how can we help you?

876
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,636
Hello. I'm Hwang Sang-hyeon,
a reporter from Hyungju Daily.

877
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,014
We're working on an article

878
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,724
about self-driving car start-ups.

879
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,936
-Hello.
-My gosh. Hello.

880
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:34,480
-May I interview you?
-Of course.

881
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,814
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

882
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,483
-Thank you.
-Have a seat here.

883
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,693
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

884
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,904
-Hello.
-I asked around in the industry.

885
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:45,950
Everyone says Cheongmyeong Company
is the new dark horse.

886
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,496
Has the word already spread?

887
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,583
It sure has.
I also heard that you plan to participate

888
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,378
in the bidding for Seonju Smart City's
self-driving platform.

889
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,129
Yes, that's correct.

890
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:03,425
They recently dealt with an incident.

891
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,053
A ransomware attack.

892
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,265
Ransomware? You mean, they were hacked?

893
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,851
That's right.
This isn't some offline business.

894
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,979
We're talking about
self-driving cars here.

895
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:19,692
Right. For other types of businesses,
it'd be a simple data leak.

896
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,902
But for autonomous driving,
it could kill you.

897
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,445
Exactly.

898
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:26,156
As a start-up,
I'm sure you've had to overcome

899
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,950
countless hurdles to get here.

900
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,411
Are there any specific incidents
that you remember?

901
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,205
There have been many hurdles
along the way.

902
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,584
But we managed to overcome everything,
and the company is stable now.

903
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,504
I'm glad to hear that.

904
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:46,176
The company I interviewed yesterday
dealt with a bad ransomware attack

905
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,220
and had to pay over 200 million won.

906
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:51,098
Really? We also had…

907
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:57,396
Oh, no. You guys dealt with one too?

908
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,066
Well, they got some outside help
and managed to get it sorted out.

909
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,361
But it's something that
shouldn't have happened to begin with.

910
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,530
You're absolutely right.

911
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,743
It wouldn't be right for a company
like that to get such a big project.

912
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,244
I wholeheartedly agree.

913
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,832
My, we are serving the common good.

914
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,167
YOUR LIFE CAN BE HACKED

915
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,586
That's a sexy headline.

916
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,799
"An Autonomous Vehicle Start-up
Failed to Protect Itself From Hackers.

917
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,010
Your Life Can Be Hacked, Too!"

918
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,512
If the article is published,

919
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,474
it'll be hard for them
to get the project, right?

920
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,559
It wouldn't end there.

921
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,604
An article like this
can completely destroy

922
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,439
a start-up of this size.

923
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,608
They'll go bust right away.

924
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,238
The number you have dialed…

925
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,733
-Is this yours?
-Yes.

926
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,695
I WANT TO TAKE THE UPPER-FLOOR ELEVATOR

927
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,740
I quit my job
to start a business with you.

928
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,618
I have to say, that was very gutsy of me.

929
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:20,831
Dal-mi.

930
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,667
2STO didn't force me

931
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:28,130
to work on the self-driving system.

932
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,050
I volunteered.

933
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,305
Why?

934
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:42,186
Just in case you still remembered
that day. Like I do.

935
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,566
I was thinking it'd be nice to start
another business with you guys.

936
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,819
Maybe we can build a self-driving system.

937
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,615
I thought if you started
working on a self-driving system…

938
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,576
Be it the path you've never been on
or a road

939
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,244
where you can't see a thing
due to fog or rain.

940
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,706
A world where you are not afraid
to go or drive anywhere.

941
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,167
I wanted to do it with you.

942
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,503
That's why…

943
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,590
That day, you were my trophy,

944
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:14,635
my pride…

945
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,345
You were my dream.

946
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,430
I wanted to be your trophy,

947
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,434
your pride,

948
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,189
and your dream.

949
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,942
My comfort,

950
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:32,986
my wings…

951
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,489
I wanted to be your comfort

952
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,492
and your wings.

953
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,541
As the real me.

954
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,838
That's why I started working on it.

955
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,094
What about you?

956
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:01,807
Me too.

957
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,649
Let's

958
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,360
bid on the project.

959
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,534
I considered all the variables
before making this decision.

960
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:25,956
Okay, let's do it.

961
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,141
They're bidding soon.

962
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:47,686
But what if a similar problem
occurs again?

963
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,895
We're not just giving it a try.

964
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,023
It's not just for the experience.

965
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,399
I'll make it happen.

966
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:56,194
I had no friends back then.
So your letters were my only comfort.

967
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,572
Good Boy, are you going somewhere?

968
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,617
My name isn't Won In-jae anymore.
It's Seo In-jae.

969
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,369
Put your emotions aside.
I want your rational judgment.

970
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,413
This actually works.

971
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:07,956
What are you praying for?

972
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,709
If we win, I'll propose.

973
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:16,548
