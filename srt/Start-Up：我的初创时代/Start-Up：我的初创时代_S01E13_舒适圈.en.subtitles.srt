EPISODE 13

2
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,175
Hello. I'm Seo Dal-mi.

3
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,015
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,351
SEO DAL-MI

5
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,690
I'm here for a job interview.

6
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,276
What the hell are you doing?

7
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,738
I'd like to apply to Injae Company's
Strategic Planning Team.

8
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,033
Ms. Won In-jae.

9
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,838
-Ms. Won?
-Seriously?

10
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,342
Then tell me
why you want to work at my company.

11
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,388
Okay.

12
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,897
What you said on Demo Day

13
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,401
left a deep impression on me.

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,027
What did I say?

15
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,949
The same goes for our children
and descendants.

16
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,952
They, too, would want the world to change

17
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,329
for the better.

18
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,750
I wish to make the world a better place.
That's why I'm doing this.

19
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,087
Why did it leave a deep impression on you?

20
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,964
Because it's the same thing

21
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,718
Dad said 15 years ago.

22
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,513
"Dad"?

23
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,599
You see,

24
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,895
I can picture how the world will change
in the future.

25
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,689
Drastic changes are coming.

26
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,232
You know,

27
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,194
I didn't quit because someone punched me.

28
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,655
I quit my job to prepare for such a world.

29
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,034
So in that moment, it suddenly hit me.

30
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,660
That maybe

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,996
you and I

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,042
have the same goal.

33
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,466
Of course, I don't like that
you're focused on manpower reduction.

34
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,053
That is the first thing I'd like to change
should you hire me.

35
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,431
-You're brazen.
-I'll take that as a compliment.

36
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,278
Seo Dal-mi, the former CEO of Samsan Tech,

37
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,948
has joined Injae Company
as the company's new COO.

38
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,454
NoonGil, the app developed by Samsan Tech
during Sand Box's 12th residency program,

39
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,873
continues to expand its services
even after the acquisition.

40
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,877
The new update contains a feature
that helps users identify different pills.

41
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,295
CHEONG-MYEONG CORN DOG

42
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,677
After turning its largest profit
last quarter, Injae Company

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,886
is incorporating

44
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,472
its new business development team
as a separate company.

45
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,016
-Congratulations.
-Look over here!

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,477
Seo Dal-mi, the former team lead,

47
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,146
will serve as the CEO of this new company,
named Cheongmyeong.

48
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,650
NoonGil,
2STO's app for the visually impaired,

49
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,569
has been acquired by the world's
top private foundation.

50
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,616
The CEO of K. Jonse deeply empathizes
with the vision and objectives of NoonGil

51
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,120
and has promised ongoing support
and continual investment in its R&D.

52
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,081
Sand Box's partner, Morning Group,

53
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,084
founded the biggest AI center in Korea.

54
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,338
The company restructured
its two-year-old AI task force

55
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,967
and hired more engineers
to expand the team for this AI center,

56
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,137
which will be headed by Won Sang-su,
the CEO of Nature Morning.

57
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,180
They say
Fifan Tech is valued at 15 billion.

58
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,598
Who's the keyman there?

59
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,685
Congratulations on your promotion!

60
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,814
The development team led by Nam Do-san,
former CTO of Samsan Tech,

61
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,318
has been named the key department
at 2STO's AI Center.

62
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,861
The team has been recognized

63
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,947
for its contribution to
the Smart City project in Silicon Valley.

64
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,490
I think his contract

65
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,452
was for three years
or something like that.

66
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,871
-Yes.
-But since he's doing so well,

67
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,290
2STO won't let him go.
I guess he won't come back.

68
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,084
I hope that is the case.

69
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,924
3 YEARS LATER, SAN FRANCISCO

70
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,570
This wine smells amazing.

71
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,822
How's the wine?

72
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,867
I bought it after tasting it
during a winery tour in Napa Valley.

73
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,243
Great purchase.

74
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,789
It's very smooth,
and I barely taste any tannin.

75
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,832
Just how I like it.

76
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,418
Look at you, hotshot.

77
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,088
Gosh, it seems like only yesterday
that we were

78
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,590
eating gimbap on the roof
while smelling barbecue.

79
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,716
Gosh, I know.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,053
Hold on. Come to think of it,
we never got to eat

81
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,679
at that BBQ restaurant.

82
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,933
Right, we used to smell the food
all the time but never ate there.

83
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,687
I should be a good son for a change.

84
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,941
I should show my parents
this yacht in San Francisco.

85
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,110
Hey, don't. It's 4 a.m. in Korea now.

86
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,694
Really? Okay.

87
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,073
Then I should do a vlog.

88
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,681
Both Seoul and San Francisco's
latitude is 37Â° N.

89
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,349
It's almost the same.

90
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,354
The difference in longitude is the reason
why we're 16 hours behind here,

91
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,400
but it's so peaceful here
that it's almost hard to believe

92
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,610
-we share the same sky.
-Action.

93
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,697
-Let's begin.
-Looking back,

94
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,240
every day there felt like a war.

95
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,617
-What am I doing here?
-I was wounded every day.

96
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,998
Do-san, our captain.
How's the sea looking today?

97
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,297
Not a single cloud,
and the sea is very calm today.

98
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:57,935
A PLACE WHERE ONE FEELS SAFE AND AT EASE

99
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,443
Yes, what time would be good
to meet for the shoot?

100
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,362
Sure, then I'll see you at two.

101
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,427
Okay, I'm going.

102
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,435
BIG CORPORATIONS COMPETE
TO RECRUIT DEVELOPERS

103
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,236
Ms. Won, we're shooting
the company promo video today.

104
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,571
Yes, I remember. Is the crew here?

105
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,573
Yes, they're in the meeting room now.

106
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,247
Oh, you're back from lunch.

107
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,500
-Yes.
-Where did you go for lunch?

108
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,669
Do we have to tell you?

109
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,547
Well, I thought I saw you guys earlier.

110
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,925
We ate at the cafeteria at Sand Box.

111
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,301
Really?

112
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,470
I guess I was mistaken.

113
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,598
Let's go. We're shooting the promo video.

114
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,975
We're busy.

115
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,562
Okay.

116
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,774
Was it Studio Jakdu?

117
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,734
Can I see their portfolio first?

118
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
Do you have to see it?

119
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,448
Yes.

120
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,638
Is this their actual portfolio?

121
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
What if our video turns out like this?

122
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,808
What's wrong with this?

123
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,060
This video has reached one million views.

124
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,479
Don't tell me
this is what we're going for.

125
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,608
No. Ours will be much better, of course.

126
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,658
Ms. Won, we're ready. Shall we?

127
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,452
Can we go over the concept first?

128
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,956
We took inspiration from Frozen.

129
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,002
I'm not doing this.

130
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,338
Nice. That's refreshing.

131
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,423
Then, are we playing

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
Elsa and Anna?

133
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,429
Bingo. That's the idea.

134
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,601
Ms. Won, you know
that hand gesture Elsa makes, right?

135
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,479
I need you to do that
and make it look more dramatic.

136
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,565
-Hand gesture?
-Yes, she does this.

137
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,781
As if you're snapping your fingers.
Got it?

138
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,283
No!

139
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,078
No, you can do it!

140
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,580
You can do it.

141
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,672
Ms. Won, are you ready?

142
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,716
Are we really doing this?

143
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,052
All right. Please look at the camera.

144
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,929
Let's do this.

145
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,390
Ready, cue!

146
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,561
Hello. I'm Won In-jae, the CEO of
Injae Company, the company that aims

147
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,147
to change the paradigm
of control systems through AI.

148
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,484
EARNEST

149
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,737
Hello. I'm Won In-jae, the CEO of
Injae Company, the company that aims

150
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,156
to change the paradigm
of control systems through AI.

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,660
In the past three years,
we've been ranked fifth

152
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,371
for best-selling CCTV systems using AI
and have been named

153
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,915
the fastest-growing company
in the industry.

154
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,459
Companies such as Jeonghan Bank,
Jeonghan Construction,

155
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,461
Taeram Construction, World Oil, and so on

156
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,339
use our control and monitoring systems.

157
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,424
Our goal is to expand

158
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,260
and strengthen security controls,
not reduce manpower.

159
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,431
And we've built
an effective, expansive system for it.

160
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,685
With the know-how gained from developing
our CCTV monitoring system,

161
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,521
we are now investing
in a new business project.

162
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,773
And that project isâ¦

163
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,526
A self-driving system.

164
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,155
SELF-DRIVING SYSTEM

165
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,533
Hello. I'm Seo Dal-mi,
the CEO of Cheongmyeong Company,

166
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,577
a self-driving car start-up.

167
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:35,129
A world where the elderly or the
visually impaired can be more mobile.

168
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,756
Every year, the number of
traffic-related deathsâ¦

169
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,053
-Are you all right?
-Gosh, seriously.

170
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,348
Ms. Seo, why grab the steering wheel?

171
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,475
She doesn't trust us.

172
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,768
Gosh, I do trust you. But you know,

173
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,605
there's a thing called automatic reflexes.

174
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,231
That was totally involuntary.

175
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,983
Jeez.

176
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,652
Sorry. I'll do better this time.

177
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,073
Do we have to start over?

178
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,619
No, I can edit it.
Let's just pick up where we left off.

179
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,829
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

180
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,041
All right. Ready, cue!

181
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,462
Every year, 1.2 million people
die from traffic accidents.

182
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,384
To more quickly welcome such a world,
Injae Company

183
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,138
began developing a self-driving system
last year using our vision technology

184
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,390
with the goal of reaching level four.

185
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,935
She's actually doing this.

186
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,145
Right?
She's launching a self-driving system.

187
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,064
At her sister's company. Her enemy.

188
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,149
I wonder if Do-san has watched this video.

189
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,653
-What video?
-Oh, it's nothing.

190
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,990
Cheon-ho made a promo video.

191
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,742
-Okay.
-With Ms. Seo in it.

192
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,161
Really?

193
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,622
Looks like she's launched
a self-driving car start-up.

194
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,873
Do you want to see it?

195
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,917
No.

196
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,714
Hey, why did you have to bring that up?

197
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,467
Have you heard him talk about her
since moving here?

198
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,553
-No, right?
-Right, never.

199
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,221
Not even once.

200
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,014
So don't bring her up.

201
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,267
Don't throw a pebble into a calm lake.

202
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,690
Have you seen Chul-san's vlog?

203
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,819
No. Does Chul-san
have his own channel now?

204
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,862
Yes, I think a lot of people watch it.

205
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,032
2STO, Silicon Valley, San Francisco.

206
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,702
It's pretty cool, you know.

207
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,790
Do you want the link?
Do-san appears in his videos sometimes.

208
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,293
No, it's okay.

209
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,588
I'm busy with getting the permit
for our self-driving system.

210
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,424
Let's do another test shoot next time.

211
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,009
Sounds good.

212
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,106
Don't rub your eyes after touching dirt.

213
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,190
That's dirty.

214
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,946
Gosh, look how dirty this is.

215
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,948
Oh, there's a puppy!

216
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,411
That little rascal.

217
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,169
We have to cancel the hotel staycation

218
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,754
for this Chuseok.

219
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,797
This lawsuit I'm working on is intense.

220
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,925
Are you the only one with a job?
I work too.

221
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,885
Just go with your friends.

222
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,512
Take them out for nice meals
with my credit card.

223
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,015
I make money too, you know.

224
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,809
What do you want me to do, then?

225
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,062
Forget it. Let's break up.

226
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,025
Hey, over here.

227
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,114
-Where's Yu-jeong?
-She's playing with a puppy over there.

228
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,745
How about a hotel staycation this Chuseok?

229
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,205
Yu-jeong's dad can look after her.

230
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,540
Aren't you going with your boyfriend?

231
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,709
-I broke up with him just now.
-Again?

232
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,087
You can never get past three months.

233
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,593
CHUL-SAN ICED VANILLA LATTE LOVER

234
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,887
A VACATION AFTER 3 YEARS

235
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,725
Today, I'm neither at work nor at home.

236
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,229
Let's get this vlog started on this yacht.

237
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,315
What am I doing here?

238
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,609
2STO rewarded us with a vacation

239
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,237
for working hard
and successfully completing the project.

240
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,531
For a month. One full month.

241
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,409
Applause! Applause, please.

242
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,453
So we're sailing together now.

243
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,916
You know, Yong-san has been working out
since moving to Silicon Valley.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,877
He's been going to the gym at work
every single day.

245
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,255
-What are you reading?
-The book I couldn't finish.

246
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
-Is it good?
-Yes.

247
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,882
-Look, his abs!
-Hey!

248
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,092
You're a freak.

249
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,761
Sorry, I'll show you next time.

250
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,099
Now, allow me to introduce the real freak
who brought laptop here

251
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,308
to write code.

252
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,771
Do-san, our captain.
How's the sea looking today?

253
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,734
Not a single cloud,
and the sea is very calm today.

254
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,111
Freak.

255
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,409
-Oh, boy.
-But seriously, what a gorgeous day.

256
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,977
Be it the path you've never been on
or a road where you can't see a thing

257
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,354
due to fog or rain.

258
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,025
A world where you are not afraid
to go or drive anywhere.

259
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,528
We will create such a world.

260
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,760
What time do you get off?
Want to grab dinner?

261
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,929
With who?

262
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,972
"Dal-mi"?

263
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,519
Hey, you can't address her like that.

264
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,270
Call her Ms. Seo.

265
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,900
You met her through work,
so don't cross the line.

266
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,944
I tried to feel her out,

267
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,071
and she's not interested in you.

268
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,657
What did she say?

269
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,076
She doesn't like your small hands.

270
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,869
She likes men with big hands.

271
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,580
The hands?

272
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,958
That's her type?

273
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
Why keep trying?

274
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,713
These days, giving up right away

275
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,173
is considered good manners.

276
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,802
Stop hitting on her, please.

277
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,303
You're going to ruin everything.

278
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,889
Hello? Hey!

279
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,892
Gosh, this prick.
What is the matter with him?

280
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,602
What was that about?

281
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,357
Ms. Seo is applying for the
temporary permit for her self-driving car.

282
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,608
What about it?

283
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,527
She needed a certificate of insurance,

284
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,364
so I put her in touch with a friend
of mine who has previous experience

285
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,907
with the same kind of insurance,

286
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,870
but he's going on about her
because he's interested in her.

287
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,122
I had good intentions butâ¦

288
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,875
Director Han!

289
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,259
What's covered?

290
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,678
Any kind of damage caused by defects

291
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,806
or automotive hacking is covered.

292
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,477
CAR INSURANCE APPLICATION

293
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,567
It'll be done by next week, right?

294
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,029
For you,
I'll make sure it'll be done this week.

295
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,408
-Okay, thank you--
-In return,

296
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,660
buy me dinner today.

297
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,579
Sorry?

298
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,290
I was just kidding.

299
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,544
I'll buy you dinner.

300
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,339
Sorry, I have plans this evening.

301
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,466
What kind of plan?

302
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,760
Why does he keep speaking so casually?

303
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,304
Chuseok is coming up,

304
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,722
so I have to make songpyeon.

305
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,350
I love songpyeon.

306
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
Can I go have some?

307
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,103
-Look.
-What?

308
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,402
I'll make some for you.
I'd love to make songpyeon at your place.

309
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,155
Let's go.

310
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,010
What are you doing?

311
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,096
My gosh, you have such petite hands.

312
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,225
Very cute.

313
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,105
Oh, you know what?

314
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,359
I actually don't love songpyeon.
I don't like eating carbs.

315
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,694
What about meat fritters?

316
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
I make mean meat fritters.

317
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,656
Where are you going? It's this way.

318
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,950
Meat fritters!

319
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,913
I guess I have big hands.

320
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,517
He doesn't want to eat
the songpyeon that I make.

321
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,026
Why don't you come over
if you're free today?

322
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,988
-What?
-You always come over on the holidays

323
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,198
and eat all the food. Don't you feel bad?

324
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,075
Come over and help us.

325
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,161
You never lift a finger
but eat all the food.

326
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,830
But I prefer to lift a toeâ¦

327
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,914
Sorry.

328
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,050
SEO DAL-MI

329
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,847
SEO DAL-MI

330
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,933
What's up?

331
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,102
I'm not calling about work.

332
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,939
-Have you left the office?
-No, not yet. What's up?

333
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,610
Well, we're preparing all the food
for Chuseok today.

334
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,737
Want to come over?

335
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,201
-I'm busy.
-Then what about Chuseok?

336
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,120
Are you going to spend the day alone?
Won't you be bored?

337
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,457
I'm too busy to get bored.

338
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,171
Jeez.

339
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,049
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's so good.

340
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,425
In-jae can't come, right?

341
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,177
I mean, she won't come.

342
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,388
I know her schedule.
She's really busy these days.

343
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,934
-Shall we get started?
-Okay.

344
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,105
Hey, Good Boy.
Do you know how to make songpyeon?

345
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,483
No, teach me! I learn everything fast.

346
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,692
I'll show you.

347
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,779
This much would do.

348
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,573
This much? This is fun.

349
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,617
-It's easy.
-I see.

350
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,994
I think yours is too small.

351
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,080
And close it up all the way.

352
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,712
-Like this.
-I think he got it.

353
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,630
Right here.

354
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,341
-Mom, is it going well?
-Close it up like this.

355
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,301
-I see.
-Then go over it again.

356
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,970
-I should be more thorough.
-Yes.

357
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,891
-After that--
-Is this how it's supposed to look?

358
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,227
-Oh, Grandma.
-What?

359
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,772
I have to say, Dal-mi is alsoâ¦
She's good, right?

360
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,941
-She's so good.
-She sure is my daughter.

361
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,240
-Let me taste one.
-Here.

362
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,075
It's hot!

363
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,328
-Gosh, be careful. I got it.
-It's very hot.

364
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,997
-It's so hot!
-My gosh!

365
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,585
That felt like burning lava.

366
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,301
I don't see any good cards.

367
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,430
If you have nothing, remember this order.
December, October, May, Novemberâ¦

368
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,017
We can hear you, you know.
You can't give her pointers.

369
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,602
-That is not allowed.
-Seriously.

370
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,438
The loser has to make all the skewers.

371
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,398
Okay, my turn.

372
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,697
-A matching card!
-A matching card?

373
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,241
-Give up a card each. Hey!
-Gosh.

374
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,159
-Come on.
-Hurry.

375
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,494
Ms. Choi, why are you so excited?

376
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,756
Is Good Boy asleep?

377
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,677
He should just sleep here.

378
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,390
All right. It's chilly,
so bring a blanket and--

379
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,392
I already did, Grandma.

380
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,937
Pack him some food
for when he leaves tomorrow.

381
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,274
He likes zucchini fritters,
so give him a lot of those.

382
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,859
I'm already packing them up for him.

383
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,656
Grandma, aren't you going
to church tomorrow?

384
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,657
Yes, why do you ask?

385
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,452
When you're there,
can you pray for me as well?

386
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,663
For you? Why?

387
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,166
Our self-driving car, Tarzan,
will soon be tested

388
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,210
for the temporary permit.

389
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,339
Tarzan? What kind of test?

390
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,093
Oh, Tarzan is the name of
the self-driving car my company developed.

391
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:39,431
It needs a driving license
before it can drive on the roads.

392
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,475
The test for that is next month.

393
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,354
So please pray that it will pass the test
with flying colors.

394
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,189
Gosh, it's so complicated.

395
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,525
Mother, I wrote everything down.

396
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,901
Let's pray together.

397
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,450
-Grandma.
-Yes.

398
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,327
You have to pray with all your heart.

399
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,205
So I can take you on a cross-country tour
in our self-driving car later.

400
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,917
That's okay. I've traveled enough.

401
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,132
-Did you pack everything?
-I just need a container now.

402
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,425
Okay, great.

403
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,631
Carrot, green onionâ¦

404
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,094
What are you doing?

405
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,137
You woke up?

406
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,683
I have to finish this but fell asleep.

407
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,353
Just leave it. I can finish it.

408
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,146
I can't allow that.

409
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,607
I always do my best
and concede when I lose.

410
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,234
I'm very precise like that.

411
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,820
Also, I should earn my keep.

412
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,656
You already have.

413
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,494
Thanks to you, my grandma
stayed up pretty late today.

414
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,038
Does she still sleep a lot?

415
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,666
Yes.

416
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,875
Has she seen a doctor?

417
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,461
She has, but the doctor said
nothing's wrong with her.

418
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,006
She's been sleeping a lot
since closing her corn dog business,

419
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,217
so it must be psychological.

420
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,221
She worked all her life, so maybe
this change is making her feel lost.

421
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,058
Maybe I should open a shop for her.

422
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,564
Would you

423
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,608
let me do that for her?

424
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,529
No, why would you do that?

425
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,156
I should do it for her.

426
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,159
Do I still make you uncomfortable?

427
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,205
I wish you wouldn't feel like that
around me anymore.

428
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:15,128
I want to be the person that comes to mind
when life gets tough.

429
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,762
I do think of you, of course.

430
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,264
I want to be the first person.

431
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,327
Gosh, stop eating.

432
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,079
Don't just eat carrots
if you want to munch on something.

433
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,684
BOOK NEW FLIGHTS

434
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,980
-Hey, Yong-san.
-What's up?

435
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,067
I'm going to book our flights to Korea.
When do you want to return?

436
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,527
I'll come back with you.

437
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,863
Are you booking mine too?

438
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,575
Yours? Do you want to go to Korea?

439
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,454
I should. It's been a while
since we had such a long vacation.

440
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,539
What?

441
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,792
You never went back when you
took time off before. Why now?

442
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,169
I just want to see
how my parents are doing.

443
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,963
What? Then why don't you

444
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,382
call them often like we do?

445
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,926
Why act like a caring son all of a sudden?

446
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,011
When do you want to come back?

447
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,347
I'll come back with you guys.

448
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,982
Yeong-sil, the weather.

449
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,276
Here's your fortune for today.

450
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,986
Okay, here we go again.

451
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,114
You are a faint-hearted batter.

452
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,366
Nice one. It's something different today.

453
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,660
Did you have an update?

454
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,622
Afraid of being called out,
you are unable to even swing your bat.

455
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,588
But if you continue to hesitate,
you will lose.

456
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,216
Do you know something?

457
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,468
So be brave and just swing the bat.

458
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,931
You could be called out,
but you also may hit a home run.

459
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,519
Two outs in the bottom of the ninth
and a full count.

460
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,731
It's time you stepped up your game.

461
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,677
A good ball is coming your way.

462
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,891
Swing your bat with all your might.

463
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,621
Guys.

464
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,666
Did you get the email from 2STO
about the better vesting deal?

465
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,792
Yes, I read it.

466
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,294
What's 2STO's stock price now?
Have you done the math?

467
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,171
I sure have.

468
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,465
It's enough to buy an apartment
by the Han River.

469
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,970
"Your three-year contract is over,

470
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:56,432
but 2STO would like to keep
top talent like you guys."

471
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,061
I can sense their strong determination
from this new offer.

472
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,439
This is probably what
FA's top free agents go through.

473
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,607
That's right.

474
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,529
Hey! You're on vacation now.
Put that away.

475
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,533
Yes. Should we buy an apartment
by the Han River in Seoul

476
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,869
or a studio overlooking
the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco?

477
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,455
Let's talk about it.

478
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,667
I'll just follow your decision.

479
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,086
Did you forget?

480
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,462
We said we'll always decide

481
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,589
by a show of hands
and do everything together.

482
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,010
So keep that in mind
and tell us what you think.

483
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,179
Let me think about it first.

484
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,317
GUIDE FOR SELF-DRIVING CAR
TEMPORARY OPERATION PERMIT

485
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,404
I see an empty desk over there.

486
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,698
That's the new hire's desk.

487
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,950
I guess they're running late.

488
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,244
Something came up.
I told them to work from home.

489
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,289
The demo is just around the corner.
They're going to work remotely?

490
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,206
Yes.

491
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,625
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

492
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,919
No, butâ¦

493
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,726
CHEONGMYEONG COMPANY

494
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,736
How much have we spent on making that car?

495
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,946
A little over 600 million won.

496
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,240
"A little"? No. It's a lot more than that.

497
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,701
The developers' wages and the patent--

498
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,913
If you include those expenses as well,
it's definitely more than that.

499
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,956
With all the fixed and indirect expenses--

500
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,083
It's more than two billion.

501
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,212
If we fail to get the permit,
we'll have to spend that much again.

502
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,131
Trying to pressure me?

503
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,884
No, I'm earnestly asking you
not to make a mistake.

504
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,057
Okay.

505
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,615
Darn it. I don't have time.

506
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,661
Hey, button. Hang in there
just until the end of the day.

507
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,257
My dear subscribers, what do you think?

508
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,552
It looks pretty spooky here, doesn't it?

509
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,556
A haunted house? No, no.
This isn't a haunted house tour.

510
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,475
This is where we worked
before joining 2STO.

511
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,769
This is where Samsan Tech began.

512
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,813
It's a historic place for us,

513
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,399
so I wanted to livestream from here.

514
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,362
We moved out of this space
three years ago.

515
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,198
-But no one's wanted to rent it out.
-My goodness.

516
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:04,120
It means we started out
in an awfully tough environment.

517
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,747
I might tear up.

518
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,624
Yes, me too.

519
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,586
There's a BBQ restaurant downstairs.

520
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,088
Inhaling the smoke traveling
from downstairs,

521
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,548
we ate gimbap all the time.

522
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,134
That's when we told ourselves this.
"When we make money,

523
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,429
let's go there and eat meat
instead of just inhaling the smoke."

524
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,015
-And that's happening today!
-Today!

525
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,312
All right, guys. We're off
to stuff our faces with some beef.

526
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,063
-We're so hungry.
-I'm starving.

527
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,943
All right, guys.
Don't forget to subscribe, likeâ¦

528
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,403
And hit the notification bell.

529
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,156
-Please! Bye!
-Please! Bye!

530
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,208
Hey, this isn't beef tartare.
Wait until it's cooked.

531
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,126
It's cooked.

532
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,546
This is the premium beef
that just melts in your mouth.

533
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,007
Yes, it is good.

534
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,469
But isn't it disappointing
because it smelled so good?

535
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,097
-Oh, then I'll eat them all.
-No, I can't let you do that.

536
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,853
-Shall I ask Do-san to join us?
-I already called him.

537
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,104
He said he has plans.

538
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,357
-What? What's he up to?
-No idea.

539
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,332
"I thought it'd look good on you."

540
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,626
Then she'll ask me what this means.

541
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,752
"Nothing.

542
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,921
I just like to collect shiny things."

543
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,882
What? Are you a crow or something?

544
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,677
"Do you have to know what this means?"

545
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,512
No, that's like picking a fight.

546
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,725
"What does it mean? Let me think.

547
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,186
Wellâ¦

548
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,065
It has a meaning, of course.

549
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,945
Please accept my heart.
That's what it means."

550
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,115
I almost made myself vomit.

551
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,660
Gosh, forget it.
What the heck am I doing now?

552
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,997
You are a faint-hearted batter.

553
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,419
Afraid of being called out,
you are unable to even swing your bat.

554
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,425
But if you continue to hesitate,
you will lose.

555
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,006
Mr. Han.

556
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,238
Yes. You took
the self-driving test last month, right?

557
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,157
Congratulations.

558
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,787
We're actually taking the test
next month as well.

559
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,873
Would you be able to email me
the scenario from the test?

560
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,668
I won't share it with anyone.

561
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,135
Right, I understand. Thank you.

562
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,262
So it's a no?

563
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,640
Right. It's confidential,
so they can't send it.

564
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,026
-Where are you going?
-I'll go there and see it.

565
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,152
That's not leaking info.

566
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,030
-Is that really necessary?
-I have to.

567
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,421
What are you doing here?

568
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,464
2STO gave us some time off.

569
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,926
I see. That means
you're not back for good.

570
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,302
Right.

571
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,806
You look great.

572
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,766
You too, Mr. Han.

573
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,477
I'm a director now.

574
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,896
I see. You got a promotion.

575
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,566
Congratulations, Director Han.

576
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,655
Looks like you bought a gift for someone.

577
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,490
Oh, this. Yes.

578
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,577
So be brave and just swing the bat.

579
00:40:56,412 --> 00:41:00,040
You could be called out,
but you also may hit a home run.

580
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,633
I got this for Ms. Seo.

581
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:16,223
I wanted to get her a little gift
in return for all she's done for me.

582
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,021
I see.

583
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,988
Do you want to go see her?

584
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,491
Her office has changed a lot.

585
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,368
No, that's okay. I have an appointment.

586
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,245
All right, then.

587
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,977
I forgot my car keys.

588
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,076
Is Ms. Seo not in the office?

589
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,287
She stepped out for a meeting.
Can we help you?

590
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,998
It's okay. I'll come back another time.

591
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,478
Gosh, what's wrong with my computer?

592
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,482
What's going on?

593
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,151
I keep getting disconnected,
and it's very slow.

594
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,283
Scoot over.

595
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,594
I WANT TO BECOME AN INSPIRING WOMAN

596
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,556
I WANT TO TURN A MISUNDERSTANDING
INTO REALITY

597
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,896
It's just for an hour.

598
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,190
Please pretend
to be the person in the letters.

599
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,901
We must succeed to make sure
Dal-mi won't be disappointed.

600
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,570
Do-san.

601
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,364
You're not the Do-san from the letters.

602
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,412
I got this for Ms. Seo.

603
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,507
I WANT TO TURN A MISUNDERSTANDING
INTO REALITY

604
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,582
Do-san.

605
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,141
Do-san!

606
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,287
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

607
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,497
You spilled your coffee.

608
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,041
That's okay, but your blouseâ¦

609
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,877
This is totally fine. I'm sorry again.

610
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,421
Sorry.

611
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,590
I'm really sorry.

612
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,347
I must be losing my mind.

613
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,767
Why look for a guy who's in the US now?

614
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,898
Gosh, I can't go to the meeting
looking like this.

615
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,242
Hello? Yes, I'm at Sand Box now.

616
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,327
What's up?

617
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,791
What? What did you say?

618
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,007
Thank you.

619
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,307
Thanks, Chul-san. That was a good meal.

620
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,478
I have to say,
this restaurant is very expensive.

621
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:17,024
Hey, we're now successful enough
to dine at such an expensive restaurant.

622
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:17,941
I know, right?

623
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,240
What? Sa-ha?

624
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,744
Chul-san? Yong-san?

625
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,539
What are you guys doing here?
I thought you were in the US.

626
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,999
We're here on vacation.

627
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,834
What are you doing here?

628
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,046
I had drinks with my friends in the area.

629
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,509
My gosh. What a crazy coincidence.

630
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,428
I know. What's the likelihood
of something like this happening?

631
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,598
Very slim! Seoul is a huge city.

632
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,060
We arrived in Korea
and came here for a barbecue.

633
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,271
And just as we were leavingâ¦
It's 9:11 p.m. now.

634
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,858
The chances of you passing by here
right at 9:11 p.m.

635
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,570
Winning the lottery would be easier
than this.

636
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,448
All sorts of odd things
can happen in life, you know.

637
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,368
Anyway, are you waiting for someone?

638
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,413
I drank,
so I'm waiting for my relief driver.

639
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,251
Oh, Chul-san.
Why don't you drive her home?

640
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,710
You didn't drink at all.

641
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,588
But she already called a driver.

642
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,923
No, not yet.

643
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,677
Really? No, I meanâ¦

644
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,391
Then shall I drive you home?

645
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,810
Well, sure.

646
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,612
Wellâ¦

647
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,658
Did you manage to treat your insomnia?

648
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,119
Yes, thanks to you.

649
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,665
I'm glad to hear that.

650
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,626
You were very worried about your English.

651
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,420
How is it now? Better?

652
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,173
My English? Well, you know.
I'd say it's so-soâ¦

653
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:07,968
No, it's bad.

654
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,013
I don't say a thing in my office at 2STO.

655
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,181
It's like I'm in silent meditation
every day.

656
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,730
I'd love intensive tutoring sessions.

657
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,276
When do you go back?

658
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,363
Me? In about ten days?
I think I have ten days left.

659
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,782
Then how about I tutor you
until you leave?

660
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,827
-Seriously?
-Look ahead, will you?

661
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,373
Right, of course.
I should look ahead while driving.

662
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,419
Gosh, I'd love that.
I mean, I'd be so grateful.

663
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,963
-When's good for you?
-Anytime.

664
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,173
Whenever works for you.

665
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,093
Really? Thenâ¦

666
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,804
PUNK

667
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,640
"Punk"?

668
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,267
-It's Ms. Seo.
-Oh!

669
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,896
-Answer it.
-Is today a special day or something?

670
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,857
-Hello?
-Hey, Sa-ha.

671
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,942
It's me, Seo Dal-mi.

672
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,321
Our solution has been
attacked by ransomware.

673
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,490
All the files are encrypted now.

674
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,741
What do they want?

675
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,910
If we don't send
300 million won in 12 hours,

676
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,953
they'll destroy the decryption key.

677
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,831
If that happens, we'll lose all the files.

678
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,291
Did you call the police?

679
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,794
Yes, but they said
they can't take care of it now.

680
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,339
You mentioned that you had worked
on a ransomware case in the past.

681
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,466
Do you know of any IT security experts?

682
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,385
I'll ask around and call you back.

683
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,386
Okay, thanks.

684
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,221
Hey, it's me.

685
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,348
Can you reach your IT security manager

686
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,683
who removed the ransomware?

687
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,226
Okay, let me know.

688
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,145
Isn't hacking covered by that insurance?

689
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,398
Only automotive hacking, not this.

690
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,774
Gosh, this is crazy.

691
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,236
-No calls yet, right?
-That's right.

692
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,991
This key is too long.
It'll be difficult to solve it.

693
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,410
This will take a few days.

694
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,037
Ms. Seo.

695
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,498
Just send them the ransom
and get the decryption key.

696
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,417
Then we can restore the files.

697
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,336
Who knows? They may not give us the key.

698
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,216
Ms. Seo, what should we do?

699
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:14,469
They'll double the amount
if we don't send the money now.

700
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,430
They'll double it? So, 600 million won?

701
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,390
This is insane.

702
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,226
Think about it, Ms. Seo.

703
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,770
We've spent two billion
for this algorithm and the car.

704
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,855
300 million isn't bad.

705
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,441
Yes. Send the money now
and get the decryption key.

706
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:28,900
All our cash is tied up

707
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,944
in our new business projects.
What do we do?

708
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,627
It's okay. I can get this sorted out.

709
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,969
Hello? This is Seo Dal-mi.

710
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,471
I'm sorry for calling so late.

711
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,475
We're dealing with
a ransomware attack at the moment.

712
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,934
Yes, okay.

713
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,439
Please let them know that
they can call me even later at night.

714
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,815
Thank you.

715
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,651
Yes, IT security experts
or even white hat hackers.

716
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,320
Okay, thank you.

717
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,370
I can do this.

718
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,623
I can get this sorted out.

719
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,042
DIRECTOR HAN JI-PYEONG

720
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,214
I want to be the person that comes to mind
when life gets tough.

721
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,133
The first person.

722
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,099
DIRECTOR HAN JI-PYEONG

723
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,312
Hello? Seo Dal-mi speaking.

724
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,648
Are you Taeram Construction's
IT security manager?

725
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,900
Dal-mi.

726
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,154
It's me, Do-san.

727
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,201
Where are you?

728
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,541
Dal-mi.

729
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,253
What?

730
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,755
Are you all right?

731
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,306
Yes, I'm fine.

732
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,018
Where are you?

733
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,021
This is a domestic number.

734
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,108
I'll come now.

735
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,152
I said I'm fine.

736
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,572
Why would you come here?

737
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,783
Sa-ha told me everything.

738
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,909
You're at work, right?

739
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,288
I can get there in 20 minutes,
so don't worry. Just wait for me.

740
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,216
Okay.

741
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,640
-Do-san.
-Did you leave the port open?

742
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,184
What?

743
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,520
What the hell are you doing?

744
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,444
Our new developer left port 22 open

745
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,237
because he had to work from home.

746
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,322
That's when we got infected.

747
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,949
-Ms. Seo.
-Is everything backed up?

748
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,867
Hey, it's none of your business.

749
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,328
We were in a rush,
so we couldn't back up the files.

750
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,913
You really should have.

751
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,540
Is it that hard to sync files
between two servers?

752
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,135
Are the files backed up?

753
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,720
What's going on?

754
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,224
They got in through the port
that was open to connect to SSH.

755
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,226
Nothing's backed up.

756
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,354
Why not?
You should always back up all the files.

757
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,773
Chul-san, check the session log
and the system log.

758
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,525
Check for any external IP addresses.

759
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,609
You got it.

760
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,822
What happened?

761
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,949
Ask later.
Let's get this sorted out first.

762
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,159
Check for suspicious files
on the scheduler.

763
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,619
Okay.

764
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,890
Hey, I combed through the library.

765
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,309
A suspicious file was executed
three hours ago,

766
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,020
but that file is gone now.

767
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,354
It must've been deleted.

768
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,607
It was stopped halfway through.
I bet the defender quarantined it.

769
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,984
Send it over if you find it.

770
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,652
-Okay.
-Got it.

771
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,499
Why does this feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu?

772
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,169
This looks familiar.

773
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,795
Of course, it does.

774
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,591
You saved me when I almost had to deal
with a ransomware attack six years ago.

775
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,470
Exactly.
The character strings look similar.

776
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,639
Is it the same person?

777
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,142
-No way.
-Found it.

778
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,810
It was in the isolated storage.

779
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,471
I found the decryption key.

780
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:34,974
Seriously?

781
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,734
Done.

782
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,028
The decryption key works.

783
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,364
Thank God.

784
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,367
All the files will be restored
in about 30 minutes, give or take.

785
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,535
Really?

786
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,664
Thank goodness.

787
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,332
-Are you okay?
-My gosh.

788
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,750
Yes, I'm fine.

789
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,503
Dal-mi, I got you.

790
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,173
I'll go get some water.

791
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,801
Water? It's right there. Hey!

792
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,616
Thanks.

793
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,747
Are you all right?

794
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,501
Yes, I'm fine.
It's just because I'm so relieved now.

795
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,715
When did you come back?

796
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,050
About a week ago.

797
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,844
I see.

798
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,054
Are you back for good?

799
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,432
No, just for vacation.

800
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,435
I see, vacation.

801
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,897
Then when do you go back?

802
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,191
Next week.

803
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,454
Oh, I was very worried about NoonGil.

804
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:20,914
Thanks.

805
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,584
I heard it was acquired
by a highly acclaimed foundation.

806
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,795
-Was it K. Jonse?
-Yes.

807
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,882
I met them at a networking event,

808
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,635
and they deeply empathized
with NoonGil's vision.

809
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:35,970
That's so impressive.

810
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,848
You met such famous people.

811
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,351
It must've been nice.

812
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,730
Yes.

813
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,775
It is nice,

814
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,946
but that's why it's boring.

815
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,550
Why did I have to run into him
when I look like this?

816
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,096
Why? You still look the same.

817
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,267
"The same"?

818
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,231
Right.

819
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:33,611
I'm always such a hot mess,
who's all over the place.

820
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,533
That's not what I meant.

821
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,663
Thanks so much for everything today.

822
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,457
Thank you.

823
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,045
I hadn't felt that thrill

824
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,257
in a long time.

825
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,134
This is unacceptable.

826
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,261
The test is coming up.
What are we going to do

827
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,721
without two lead developers?

828
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,973
Wait, Hyeon. Hyeon!

829
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,812
The phone is turned off.
You will be directedâ¦

830
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,400
Jeong's phone is off too.

831
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,238
How many days do we have left?

832
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,586
Dong-cheon. Park Dong-cheon.

833
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,550
Did someone get hacked?
I saw the IT security team.

834
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,387
Ms. Won and Ms. Seo called them.

835
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,930
Cheongmyeong Company

836
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,265
had to deal with a ransomware attack
last night.

837
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,143
They stayed up all night
and contacted security teamsâ¦

838
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,981
It's okay. Don't take it to heart.
He didn't ignore me.

839
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,400
He's always like that.

840
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,652
Anyway, where were we?

841
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,238
-Where were we?
-The meal allowance.

842
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:42,240
Right. If you go
to the cafeteria upstairsâ¦

843
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,390
I should've worn a different blouse.

844
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:19,819
Dal-mi.

845
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:21,571
I mean, Ms. Seo. What happened?

846
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,406
You had a ransomware attack?

847
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,032
It's all good now.

848
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,661
We found the decryption key
and got all the files restored.

849
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,580
How?

850
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,624
Do-san was here.

851
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:38,546
Chul-san, Sa-ha, and Yong-san too.

852
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,673
They all came to help me.

853
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,972
So it's all been sorted out now?

854
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,600
Yes.

855
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,019
I'm glad.

856
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,201
I feel so much better now.

857
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,037
This was what I missed the most
when we were in the US.

858
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,122
-More than the rib eye?
-A million times more.

859
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,295
By the way, it looks like
Shin Hyeon and Shin Jeong are quitting.

860
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,380
What? Why?

861
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,091
How dare they?

862
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,386
I can't believe they're quitting
when they couldn't prevent the attack.

863
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,431
The test is just around the corner.
I'm worried.

864
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,188
Hey, come out for a second.

865
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,357
Oh, boy.

866
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,988
Let's stop worrying about others
and vote already.

867
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,616
-For what?
-What do you think?

868
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,536
We should decide where to buy property.

869
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,746
Overlooking the Han River
or in San Francisco?

870
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,414
No, not about that.

871
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,543
Are we going to accept
2STO's offer and stay in the US

872
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,962
or give up the vesting deal
and move back for good?

873
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,464
What?

874
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:06,592
The past few days
have taught me something.

875
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,762
San Francisco has clean air
and great weather. It's all great,

876
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,056
but I find that city a little boring.

877
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,434
Coming back here

878
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,645
has made me realize
that I like the thrill.

879
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,356
So you want to move back to Korea
for good?

880
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,234
I will go back to San Francisco
if that's what you guys want.

881
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,652
But let me ask you, Do-san.

882
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,905
Do you want to go back or stay here?

883
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,991
You have the casting vote.

884
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,910
Why Do-san?

885
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:36,038
Because I want to stay
and you want to go back.

886
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,583
That's one to one.
So Do-san has the casting vote--

887
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,209
I never said that.

888
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,838
I want to stay too, so that's two to one.

889
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,048
Your vote doesn't even count,
so just stay.

890
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,136
It's not like you guys wanted
to go to the US.

891
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,054
You were forced to go because of me.

892
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,391
Thanks for not resenting me.

893
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,768
What are you talking about? Go away.

894
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,106
-Did you finish all the food?
-Yes.

895
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,941
Then hurry back to Sand Box.

896
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,776
Your jacket is at Ms. Seo's office.

897
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,987
You prick, why didn't you tell me earlier?

898
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,780
As if.

899
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,491
Hey.

900
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,912
It was three to zero anyway.

901
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,881
I WANT TO LAUNCH MY START-UP BECAUSE

902
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,804
I WANT TO TURN A MISUNDERSTANDING
INTO REALITY

903
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,059
Have you opened the music box?

904
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,937
-Yes.
-What did it sound like?

905
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,688
It was

906
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,858
unbelievably

907
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,277
wonderful.

908
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:39,912
Wait, Dal-mi.

909
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,416
What do you like about me?

910
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:47,420
No?

911
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,297
You said you guys are preparing
to start a company.

912
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,966
Right.

913
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,636
That was actually--

914
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,140
What she meant by that was
we'll be working together.

915
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,563
You have nice, big hands.

916
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,553
Let's talk.

917
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,579
It's very close.
You didn't have to drive me, you know.

918
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,789
I should do these things for you
when I'm here.

919
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,166
Are you taking driving lessons?

920
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,209
Yes, I started yesterday.

921
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,003
Then drive me to the airport

922
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:36,130
with this car when I leave.

923
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,965
Okay, I'll try my best.

924
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:47,683
That friend of yours. Was her name Dal-mi?

925
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,854
Did you have a chance to see her?

926
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,148
No.

927
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,611
-You don't want to see her?
-No.

928
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,700
LEE CHUL-SAN

929
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,577
Hey, what's up?

930
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,787
Hey, Do-san. I'm with Sa-ha now.

931
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,664
What? You met her?

932
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,667
Yes. Anyway, Ms. Seo just called her.

933
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:17,588
They're dealing with a bad
ransomware attack just before their test.

934
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:20,216
It sounds very stressful.
How much was it again?

935
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,550
Three hundred million won.

936
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,969
The decryption key will be destroyed
if they don't send the money.

937
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,097
-Where's Dal-mi now?
-At her office, I guess.

938
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,766
I'm headed there now,

939
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:32,061
but I can't do this by myself.
Can you come now?

940
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,607
-Mom, I should go help them out.
-Okay, no problem.

941
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,987
-Hurry.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

942
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,031
Don't worry. You should hurry.

943
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,005
DAL-MI

944
01:11:01,548 --> 01:11:03,634
Hello? Seo Dal-mi speaking.

945
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:05,678
Are you Taeram Construction's
IT security manager?

946
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,471
Dal-mi.

947
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:11,850
It's me, Do-san.

948
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,647
Where are you?

949
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,529
Dal-mi.

950
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,200
Are you all right?

951
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,414
I'll come now.

952
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,334
Why is this so hard?

953
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,921
Out of my 30 years of life,
we only spent a few months together.

954
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,632
Why is it so hard to forget you?

955
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,553
-Is this a threat?
-No. I'm giving you a chance.

956
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,555
I should give you advice,

957
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,933
but I'm too personally involved.

958
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,352
The Tarzan story you told meâ¦

959
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,563
It was fascinating.

960
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,274
I don't want to be confused anymore.

961
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:03,235
I don't want to see you again.

962
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:09,408
