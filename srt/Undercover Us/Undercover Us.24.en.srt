1
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,800
Are you okay?

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
I'm late.

4
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,810
Let's go.

5
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,360
Si-an!

6
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,120
Si-an!

7
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,400
Si-an!

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,080
Hang in there.

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
My father will save you.

10
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Don't cry.

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Si-an.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,440
You promised me

13
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,360
you'll always be with me.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't break your promise.

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Don't be silly.

16
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,759
Live well.

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,920
Si-an!

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,079
Si-an!

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Wake up!

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,520
Si-an!

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Si-an!

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
Si-an!

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
Si-an!

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Give it up.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm going to destroy Nameless Pavilion today.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Yunzhou will be alone.

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,000
My dear Yuan.

28
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,280
The world in Yunzhou...

29
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
will be yours.

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,420
Thank you, Father.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,880
Good boy.

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,970
This is ridiculous.

33
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,920
How can a woman ascend the throne? Master Rong.

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,079
For thousands of years,

35
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,720
there is no such rule.

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
I've learned the art of an emperor since I was a child.

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
I studied the Art of War of Grandson.

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
With my ability,

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
is far better than Xie Ci Yuan who is just ten years old.

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,079
So what?

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,560
The world

42
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,760
is still my world.

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
If you are not convinced,

44
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,940
you can accompany the old City Governor.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,680
Greetings, Master Rong.

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
Father, look.

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,959
If you don't want to give it to me,

48
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,160
you don't want to give me.

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
Let's go! Let's go!

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,880
didn't lose.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Si Yao.

52
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,360
Si Yao!

53
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,920
Si Yao.

54
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
Mianwan.

55
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,800
Although you are still weak,

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,200
if you want to go back to the Laundry Valley,

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
we can set off in a few days.

58
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,960
Tomorrow?

59
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,740
I'll wait for you outside.

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,690
Why are you leaving?

62
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,980
There's no obstacle between us anymore.

63
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Thank you.

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
I can't be with you

66
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
with you calmly.

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Why?

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,820
If you're willing,

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,840
you'll be the most respected woman in Yunzhou.

70
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,240
No matter you are Si Yao,

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
or Mianwan,

72
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
Let’s start over.

73
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay?

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
There are

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,920
have died because of us.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,480
They all died because of us.

77
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
The dead are gone.

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,480
The living

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
deserve to live?

80
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,180
Besides, what happened today

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,560
is not our fault.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
We did nothing wrong.

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,250
For the sake of Yunzhou,

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,680
and the people,

85
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
for the people.

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640
And I...

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Which beauty in Qifeng Pavilion

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Let me

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,480
see the real face.

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
How can such a beauty

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,760
be buried here?

92
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
Come with me.

93
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,080
Come.

94
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
Let me show you a treasure.

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Watch carefully.

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,330
Look. It's here.

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
Is it fun, Your Ladyship?

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
I will

99
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,860
until death do us part.

100
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
We will never be apart.

101
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Everything will be over.

102
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I believe

103
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,770
You have to believe that

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
Madam won't be a killer anymore.

105
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
she can open a clinic.

106
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,820
I'm here to look after your hospital.

107
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,360
You're talking nonsense again.

108
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
You still don't know me.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
I don't like being threatened,

110
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
but I have a weakness.

111
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
For example now.

112
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,040
I can try my beauty.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
I'll do whatever you say.

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
You are the deity

115
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,480
and respected all gods.

116
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,140
the Princess Xuanping who was officially married.

117
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
Who told you it's fake?

118
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,800
let's stop here.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Okay?

120
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,320
Since young,

121
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
you've been taking care of me.

122
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
and spoiled me.

123
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Don't worry.

124
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
I can do it myself.

125
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,440
I can take care of myself now.

126
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,280
I will take care of

127
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,960
I will take good care of them.
