1
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,600
You're just a rat.

2
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,980
How dare you barge into the City Governor's mansion at night? Your Highness.

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,160
Get him! Get him!

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,080
Go!

5
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,329
I'm here to see you. Let's go. Let's go.

6
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,480
What is it?

7
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Under the order of the City Governor, I'm here to search for the assassin. Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,600
to search the assassin.

9
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,280
Madam Kam!

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,400
Excuse me.

11
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,760
Wait.

12
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,420
Are you suspecting me of hiding an assassin?

13
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,650
You misunderstood.

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
We are just following orders.

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,160
After all,

16
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,079
we can't catch the assassin.

17
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,040
Your Ladyship, we can't guarantee

18
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,360
can't be guaranteed.

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,040
Search.

20
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
You! The memorial tablet of the late Castellan

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,720
is not something you can touch.

22
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,200
I...

23
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
What?

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,840
Even if Xie Cizhou is here,

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,460
even if Xie Cizhou is here.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
If you don't believe me,

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
you can ask her to try it.

28
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,360
Kill her father to seize the throne.

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,480
It's unforgivable.

30
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,280
If she dares to touch this memorial tablet,

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,480
she will be punished.

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,720
Are you done?

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,610
Get lost if you're done.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Let's go.

35
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,720
Let's go.

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Don't worry.

37
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
I can take you away.

38
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
Be careful.

39
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,220
Let's go. Let's go.

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Mother.

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,480
Next time you come out,

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
can you take me somewhere else?

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
I heard that the lantern festival in Linzhou is very beautiful.

44
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,920
I haven't even seen

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I've never seen it before.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
Read ten thousand books.

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,490
and travel thousands of miles.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
Although I can't be with you all the time,

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,560
when you grow up,

50
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,040
you can go to all the places you want to go.

51
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Why can't you be with me?

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,120
Mother, don't worry.

53
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
When I grow up,

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
I'll take you to the end of the world.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay.

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
She’s poisoned by her son,

57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,240
yet you want to assassinate Xie Cizhou.

58
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,160
You must have your own consideration.

59
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,360
My son.

60
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm useless.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,000
That's all I can do for you.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
A bunch of losers.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,360
They got away again.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Take them away.

65
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Kill them all!

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,680
Yes.

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
Master Rong! Master Rong!

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,920
Master Rong!

69
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,320
Master Rong, please spare me!

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,210
Master Rong.

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Why are you back?

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,560
I heard that Master Rong was attacked.

73
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,000
so I rushed back.

74
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,200
How are you?

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,659
I had a few rounds with that thief.

76
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,960
He's quite skilled.

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,280
He's as good as you.

78
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,240
These days,

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,450
I asked you to watch Xie Ciyuan.

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
What's wrong?

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,600
His Highness

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,800
in the mansion.

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Before I rushed back to the City Governor's Residence,

84
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,760
His Highness and Her Highness were in bed.

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
What a disgrace.

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Master Rong.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,840
I haven't noticed anything wrong

88
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,760
I didn't notice anything wrong.

89
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
Instead of wasting my time on someone like him,

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
let me return to you.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
You've been attacked by the assassins of the Nameless Pavilion twice.

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,080
It shows that they have evil intentions.

93
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,560
I...

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,080
I'm really worried.

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
to leave your safety

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
to someone else.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,050
I overstepped the line.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,220
I shouldn't question your decision.

99
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,120
I'll go back to Duke Xuanping's mansion now.

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,280
Wait.

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,760
I know

102
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,360
you care about my safety the most.

103
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Why would I blame you?

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,320
You don't have to go to Prince Xuanping's Mansion.

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Just ask someone to keep an eye on it.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Inform the Minister.

107
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,400
Tell him to come to see me

108
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,280
before dawn.

109
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,960
Yes.

110
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,160
This guy

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,840
knows the City Governor's Residence well.

112
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
He's quite skilled.

113
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
It shouldn't be a problem to escape.

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,520
It's okay.

115
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,880
But what if

116
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
fall into Xie Cizhou’s hands,

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I’m afraid he’ll die.

118
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,760
How many times have you murdered your husband?

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,060
How are you?

120
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Are you hurt?

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
I know you're worried about me.

122
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,040
So no matter how hard it is,

123
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll come back.

124
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
You know

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,160
it's easy to get out of the City Governor's mansion.

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
For Qinglin,

127
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,320
for a Qinglin?

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,600
No one knows Xie Cizhou better than me.

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,060
As long as she is in danger,

130
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,760
I will go to beg him

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
to bring him back.

132
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
By then,

133
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,800
they won't have the heart to monitor us.

134
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
What if you hurt her

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,000
and hurt yourself?

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
What's the difference between you killing yourself?

137
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,200
I know what to do.

138
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,360
You know what to do.

139
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,800
If I didn’t worry about saving you tonight,

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,400
you would have been caught alive by Xie Cizhou.

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,560
Fine.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
I was thoughtless.

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,760
Thank you for saving me.

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
How should I

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
repay you?

146
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,200
Can I give myself to you?

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
Who cares?

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,570
I really don't want it. I don't want it.

149
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
I think you all know

150
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,120
about my assassination last night.

151
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Lieutenant Li,

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,370
You are responsible for the city defense.

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,080
to protect Ping City.

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,640
but let the assassins of Nameless Pavilion be so rampant.

155
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,920
Do you have anything to explain to me?

156
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
Master Rong,

157
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
For months,

158
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,160
we destroyed several branches of Nameless Pavilion.

159
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,280
But Wufeng is too cunning

160
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
and has a mysterious track.

161
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,120
I...

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,840
I couldn't find any trace of her.

163
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
As for last night,

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,520
I've asked Commander Lu to strengthen security.

165
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,480
But unexpectedly,

166
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
he neglected his duty

167
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
and put Master Rong in danger.

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,480
Commander Lu.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,760
The evidence of your negligence is solid.

170
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Apologize to Master Rong now.

171
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
At this point,

172
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,560
what else do you want to say?

173
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,240
There's always a reason to accuse me.

174
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,680
Master Rong is so foolish.

175
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
you'll ruin...

176
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,960
will be destroyed by you sooner or later.

177
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
How dare you!

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,760
Guards!

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
Drag him away.

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
He'll be executed in three days.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,680
The light yellow body is soft.

183
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,570
The love is far away but the fragrance remains

184
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
In the next autumn,

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,280
in the fragrance of osmanthus flowers,

186
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
in this yard.

187
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
If you like it,

188
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,240
I will plant the osmanthus tree

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,970
the osmanthus tree for you.

190
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,580
Your Highness.

191
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
The merchant in the east said

192
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,800
the hairpin you asked for is out of stock.

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,860
I brought you this.

194
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,920
Thank you.

195
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,960
One more thing, Your Highness.

196
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,400
news from the City Governor's Residence.

197
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,880
that Commander Lu neglected his duty

198
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
and was sentenced to death on the spot.

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,300
He will be executed in three days.

200
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,600
He gave the task on behalf of Master Lin.

201
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
to save Commander Lu.

202
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,680
We can't let him die.

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,480
The weather is dry.

204
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,120
Watch out for the fire.

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Si-an, come here.

206
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,620
Have an orange.

207
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,120
and bought fruit from the mountain.

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,650
You want me to try it for you?

209
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,240
Try it.

210
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,450
How is it?

211
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,080
Is it sweet?
