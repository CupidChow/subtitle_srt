1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,720
Yes, Your Highness! Yes, Your Highness! Yes, Your Highness! Yes, Your Highness!

2
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
The whole city is under siege now. We can't escape. Let's go.

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,690
It’s hard to escape.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,360
Thank you for finding a fake body to impersonate you.

5
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,360
and hung it on the city gate to the public.

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,920
I don't know why.

7
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,240
to warn others.

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,240
If you do that, you'll be punished. If you do, you'll be sentenced to death.

9
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
the ministers

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,440
who opposed her

11
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,700
dare not say anything.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,000
They're afraid of setting themselves on fire.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
After all, even brothers and compatriots can kill him.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,840
There are more problems in the world.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,080
Since Wufeng died,

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
Nobody Pavilion will be in chaos without a leader.

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,440
Then she can seize the chance

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,420
and catch them all at once.

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
In your opinion,

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
what should we do?

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,440
Don't move.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Wait for a good chance to leave the city.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,920
Where is Young Master?

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,400
He has been staying in the back mountain

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,720
since noon.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,850
and never came back.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,320
Maybe because the housekeeper

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,280
sent someone to deliver osmanthus seedlings.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,009
Young Master is busy checking.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
I won't kill you.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,960
Because your life

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,320
was saved by my heart blood.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,920
You don't deserve to die.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,880
You must live.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
But I will never forgive you.

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
Never.

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
If you hate me,

38
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,640
will make you feel better.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,840
Then hate me.

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,560
Only you signed it.

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,579
is called Divorce Agreement.

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,200
not a divorce.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,079
Si Yao is dead.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
From now on,

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,920
when we meet,

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Don't blame me for being blind.

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,079
You haven't seen him all day.

48
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,810
So you're drinking here secretly?

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
You don't want to recover?

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,290
It's none of your business.

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,130
I'm going to take care of it.

52
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
I don't want to see you now.

53
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,760
Can you go away?

54
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,800
Give it back.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Why?

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Did I make you angry?

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,600
Because you and I are both murderers.

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
The murderer who killed Xie Ciyuan

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Tell me.

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
Why do you keep pushing me away?

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,159
We weren't like this before.

62
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,480
People

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
always blindly believe

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,920
what I think.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,880
is like the moon.

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,560
I thought I held it in my hand

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,320
I had it.

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
But the truth is...

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,800
Nothing.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
Everything is just

71
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
a deception.

72
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,920
It's all fake.

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
Don't be silly.

74
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,920
They are just passers-by.

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm always by your side.

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
It's all over.

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
We are still us.

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,520
You...

79
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Just now...

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
What do you want to do?

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
I just...

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,620
Please forgive me.

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,040
I deserve to die.

84
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,520
I shouldn't have

85
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
for the young master.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You deserve to die.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
All these years,

88
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,480
you and Mianwan

89
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
haven't taken that step yet.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,760
Master.

91
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,680
Have you forgotten

92
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
why

93
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,520
come to Laundry Valley?

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,280
Mianwan.

95
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
Let’s go home.

96
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,610
Dad, someone is down there.

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
You were bitten by bamboo leaves.

98
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,120
Leave me alone.

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,440
Father, let's take him back.

100
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,080
Or he will die.

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Why?

102
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,280
Because I want to save him.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll do as you say.

105
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
Don't worry.

106
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm here.

107
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
You’ll be fine.

108
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,400
Mu Wan saved my life

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,930
and cured the birthmark on my face.

110
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,760
In this life,

111
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,200
for Mu Wan.

112
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
If she is willing,

113
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,730
I'll stay with her forever.

114
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,080
I arranged your marriage myself.

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
I told you ten years ago

116
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
as long as you become the strongest secret guard,

117
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,400
you’re qualified to be Mianwan’s husband.

118
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,240
and stay by her side to protect her.

119
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,600
But now,

120
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
there's trouble.

121
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,360
Another Xie guy came out for nothing.

122
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,440
A dead man.

123
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
won't cause any trouble.

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
You're wrong.

125
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,740
Competing with a dead person,

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,290
No one can compete with him.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Never mind.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
It's about love.

129
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,480
I can't

130
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,480
I can't get involved.

131
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,320
You

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Try harder.

133
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,000
At least now,

134
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,280
Mianwan is still with you.

135
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,130
Anyway, you should know

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,600
I hope you two

137
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
can be together.

138
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,040
I also hope my daughter

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,720
can be happy.

140
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
I won't let you down.

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,360
Who are you?

142
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Officer.

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,360
My husband died of illness.

144
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,970
I sent him back to his hometown for burial.

145
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
How many days did it take?

146
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,640
The body stinks.

147
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
These days, we've been keeping a low profile in the city.

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,880
the city is heavily guarded.

149
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,920
No entry.

150
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,280
I have no choice.

151
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,880
Please make an exception.

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
If we delay any longer,

153
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
my husband's body

154
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
will rot into pieces.

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
How unlucky.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop it.

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,920
Leave now.

158
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,880
Thank you.

159
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Thank you, sir.

160
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Thank you.

161
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
Dr. Qin

162
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,960
How did you make this rotten powder?

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
It stinks.

164
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,890
I almost got choked to death in the car.

165
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
Guard Chu, you don't know.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
if the taste is not enough,

167
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,720
we couldn't get out of the city last night.

168
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Your Highness.

169
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
We're out of the city now.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,330
Where are we going next?

171
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,400
The people we sent

172
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,120
haven't found the entrance to Laundry Valley.

173
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
Do we need to keep looking?

174
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,480
There is a house

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
there was a house my mother gave me.

176
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,400
It's very hidden.

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
No one knows.

178
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,360
We can hide there for now.

179
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,740
As for the Laundry Valley,

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,440
Don't force yourself if you can't find it.

181
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,520
Let's put our safety first.

182
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,600
Yes.

183
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Madam.

184
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,640
What's wrong?

185
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,280
I was distracted during a mission last night.

186
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,810
Someone scratched my face.

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,920
Here.

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,280
Let me see.

189
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,400
Look.

190
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,480
How ugly.

191
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
It doesn't matter.

192
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
The princess is born beautiful.

193
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
