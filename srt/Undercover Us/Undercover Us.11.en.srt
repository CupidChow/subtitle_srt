1
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,000
I heard Xie Cizhou sealed the gate of the mansion.

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,200
He wants to trap us in there.

3
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Your sister

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
really lived up to her ruthless name.

5
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,520
She even killed her biological father.

6
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,160
My half-brother

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,440
is nothing to me.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,800
By the way,

9
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,800
The lantern festival is in two days.

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,200
All the high officials and nobles

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
will come to Lu City.

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,480
I believe at that time,

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
we'll gain a lot.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,800
What are you doing?

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Sir! Sir!

16
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,960
Please.

17
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,970
Our daughter is missing. Let's go.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,539
Let's go. Okay.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Stop the car.

20
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,840
We haven't seen him for three days and nights.

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Please help us find her.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
It's just embarrassing.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
There are many of them every year.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
We don't have so many people to help you.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,400
Let's go.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,050
Don't waste my time.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Sir.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Please help us find it.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,280
Sir!

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,960
Sir.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,200
You've been looking for it.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
I believe

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,730
you'll find something.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,200
I hope so.

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,520
I wonder

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,200
how Cui is now.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go somewhere else.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
A girl was lost in Pingcheng

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,860
and was sent to Lu City.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,079
Now,

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,900
why all the girls in Lu City

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,920
disappeared one after another?

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm afraid

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,880
is to find the missing girls

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,840
can be revealed.

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
Ever since you met that couple,

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,580
since you met that couple.

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
Cui's parents are so anxious.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,280
They must love their daughter very much.

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,040
I envy this kind of relationship.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
I never knew who my parents were when I was young.

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
or where they are.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,079
If possible,

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,520
I want to help them reunite.

56
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,160
It's a blessing

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
to comfort myself.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't worry.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
We will do our best

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,160
to help them.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,560
Okay.

62
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,120
Tonight, let's go and find out

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,380
about these human traffickers tonight.

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,680
Look at these goods.

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
They are all good goods.

66
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,360
They are all delicate.

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,360
Not bad

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,600
It's what the nobles like.

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,120
I'll take

70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,800
the goods.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm glad you like it.

72
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Two animals.

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
How could they do such a crazy thing?

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,680
Idiot!

75
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,160
I didn't know I was followed.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,880
I don't know either.

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,280
where they came from.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,640
You two

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,930
want to save people?

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,120
When my friends see the signal,

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,000
they will destroy all the goods in their hands.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Those women

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
will die.

84
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,920
Don't stop me.

85
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,140
He deserves to die.

86
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
He deserves to die. He deserves to die.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
But not now.

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,840
Once I get rid of all the clues on him,

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,720
I will kill them myself.

90
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,080
and make them pay

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
for what they did.

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,140
Your Highness.

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Those women

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,040
have sent them back

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,440
according to your order.

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,020
One more thing.

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,490
Go ahead.

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,730
Guard Chu sent a message

99
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
a missing woman was sent back in Pingcheng.

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Who did it?

101
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,040
We don't know yet.

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
They only said that the women were not hurt.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,410
They seem to have been treated.

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
and treated a patient.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Could it be...

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,650
Laundry Valley?

107
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,760
Why did they

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
to save these girls?

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,000
I just saw it.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
That couple's daughter isn't in the carriage.

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,480
I wish I could be faster.

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,760
If I could stop the signal bomb,

113
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
wouldn't those girls have died?

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,080
I should've gone faster.

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
You did well.

116
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,080
You're really good.

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
No one knows

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
they'd go this far.

119
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,170
It's not your fault.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
But...

121
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
No buts.

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,360
We are human.

123
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
People have weaknesses.

124
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,520
People have things they can't do.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
Many times,

126
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,640
we can only make the smallest choice.

127
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
You did your best.

128
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,600
I know.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
Why are you so stupid?

131
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,330
It's just a scratch.

132
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,920
You want to kill your husband again?

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,330
You're so stubborn.

134
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
I can't compare to you.

135
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
as your wife.

136
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Don't move.

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,240
The nameless Pavilion is living a life of licking blood.

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
This wound

139
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,200
is nothing.

140
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,500
I’ll recover soon.

141
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,320
I know how dangerous Emei is.

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
Don’t act tough.

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,600
Your wife won't be a killer anymore.

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,960
she can open a clinic.

145
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,380
I'm here to look after your hospital.

146
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
You're talking nonsense again.

147
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm going out for something.

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,320
Take a rest.

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Let's wait for the legendary rainbow show

150
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,400
to see if we can catch some big fish.

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Have you decided?

152
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,440
Do you want to tell me?

153
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
what kind of big business

154
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
What kind of big deal are they doing?

155
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,080
I don't know.

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,200
I really don't know.

157
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,000
You really don't know?

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
My Lord! My Lord!

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
Please spare me.

160
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,680
I just want to earn some money.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
I promise.

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
I swear.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
I will never do

164
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,320
this evil thing again.

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,880
Li Yan.

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,600
Who did you give the girls

167
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
to?

168
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
Give me the list.

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,320
I can consider letting you go.

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
I just know him.

171
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
I'm just a delivery man.

172
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
How would I know the list?

173
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Have you seen a girl

174
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
a girl with a tear mole?

175
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,160
The corners of her eyes.

176
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,720
There's a tear mole on the corner of your eyes.

177
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,320
No

178
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,480
I really haven't.

179
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,560
Please let me go.

180
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Please let me go.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,930
Please let me go.

182
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
It's your turn.

183
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,600
Since you know

184
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
the Grand Preceptor is behind us,

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
How dare you?

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,280
Li Rui is nothing.

187
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,280
Do you really think

188
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,760
he can protect you?

189
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,280
I'll tell you.

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
I know that girl.

191
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,840
That girl was in the last batch.

192
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,320
She...

193
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,760
She has a tear mole at the corner of her eyes.

194
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,890
She's so beautiful.

195
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,080
Where is she now?

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
She was picked up by a big shot.

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
How big?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Compared to Lee Seo,

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,840
that's all I know.

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
As for that man,

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,560
only Lieutenant Lee has seen him.

202
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
How can a villain like me

203
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,160
I don't have the right to contact him.

204
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Tell me or not.

205
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,640
it's up to you.

206
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,200
The law in Yunzhou is strict.

207
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm sure you know

208
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm sure you know.

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
The car cracks.

210
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Late.

211
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm begging you.

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,880
Please.

213
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,840
Please spare my life.

214
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
I've told you everything I know. I...

215
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,520
Please.

216
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,600
I remember I said

217
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
none of you can survive tonight.

218
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,130
I'll take you out after dinner.

219
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
I haven't read

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
I haven't read it yet.

221
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,130
Let's get down to business.

222
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Guess

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,680
How many do I plan to get this time?

224
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
How many?

225
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
Five horses.

226
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,040
You're really something.

227
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
I wonder

228
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,040
if they have so many horses.

229
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
for you to pick?

230
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
Where is Lu City?

231
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,440
As long as you have money,

232
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,280
you'll find a good horse.

233
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
I can tell

234
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
You're an amateur.

235
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,960
Your words

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,160
has taught me a lot.

237
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,440
Whether it's a wild horse

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,400
or pure,

239
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,440
who's experienced in the battlefield

240
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,960
can be easily obtained.

241
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,850
Lu City is located in the south.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
Why is there a horse farm?

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,890
There must be something wrong.

244
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,920
Okay.

245
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,200
Guys,

246
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,560
I'd like to ask where the horse seller

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,520
is in Lu City?

248
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,960
You also want to buy horses?

249
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,040
Yes.

250
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Please do me a favor.

251
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,940
Please show me the way.

252
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,920
I wonder

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
what kind of horse do you prefer?

254
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
In my opinion,

255
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,760
you need a

256
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
a big horse.

257
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,640
Is it funny?

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,120
Try smiling again.
