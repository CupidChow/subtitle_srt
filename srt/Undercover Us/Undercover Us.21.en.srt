1
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,800
Where’s Si Yao? He’s here. He’s here.

2
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
He’s not here.

3
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm afraid His Highness has lost his mind.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,140
What about him?

5
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,900
What about your young master?

6
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,000
The young master is noble.

7
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,280
Not every patient in Laundry Valley

8
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,170
needs to be taken care of by her.

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,600
What?

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,479
You think I didn't take good care of you?

11
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,840
why don't you leave as soon as possible?

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,170
It's good for both of us.

13
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
If you really feel sorry,

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,000
deal with your grudges.

16
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,820
Don't implicate the Laundry Valley.

17
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,120
I’ll leave now.

18
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,960
You...

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
What's wrong?

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,160
Get up first.

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
How are you?

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,680
Are you hurt?

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm fine.

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
I didn't hurt myself.

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,560
I didn't do it.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,440
I insisted on leaving.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,610
It has nothing to do with Mr. Si-an.

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
You're lucky.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,370
Even the king of hell won't accept you.

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,520
You're a skilled physician.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,120
After two more days of acupuncture,

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
you'll regain your practice.

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,800
so that your Qi and blood

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
to heal.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Thank you.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,740
I will never forget

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
your great kindness.

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,640
No.

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Hey.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
To be honest,

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,760
I don't like you at all.

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I don't want to save you.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
My daughter doesn't want you to die.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
I

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,490
don’t want her to be sad.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Mianwan.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,220
never begged me

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
since I was little.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,640
You

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
the only person

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,280
who can make her bow to me.

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
After you recover,

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,530
leave immediately.

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
Stop pestering my daughter.

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,440
I know I don't deserve to be forgiven.

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,800
Don't worry.

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
I've informed my men.

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,360
Once they arrive,

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,940
as soon as they arrive.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,760
I have nothing to do with

61
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
has nothing to do with me.

62
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
I know.

63
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
You said it.

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,360
But when you came in,

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,290
you still suspected me, right?

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,640
In your heart,

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,040
That's who I am.

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,140
It's not like that, Si-an.

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,800
I know.

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
you don’t

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,440
You don't mean anything to me, do you? I do.

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,120
I do. I do.

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
I said,

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I’m malicious towards Xie Ciyuan.

75
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,490
But because he is the person in your heart,

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
So even if I want to

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,760
to get rid of him,

78
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,000
I won’t do anything to hurt him.

79
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,840
Muwan.

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
In my eyes,

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
nothing is more important than you.

82
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
What's so good about me

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,300
deserve you to treat me like this?

84
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,300
Speaking of which,

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
it's not that good.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,360
But it can only be you.

87
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
No one else.

88
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,160
I knew it.

89
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,640
The more beautiful the raw materials are,

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,320
the more effective it is.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
What a pity.

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
This is the best one.

93
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I saved so much blood.

94
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,280
but she died in the end.

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,240
I'll ask you one last time.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Where

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,360
Where is he?

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
I don't know where he is.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,360
What a loyal abandoned son.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,680
Does Xie Ciyuan know

102
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,000
you are so devoted to him?

103
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
The master of the city

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
should protect the people.

105
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,960
But you are so crazy.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
You disregard human life.

107
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,800
What a righteous accusation.

108
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,040
In order to

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,880
sacrificed so many lives

110
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,960
to train a killer?

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
Have you ever counted

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
To achieve great things,

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,659
someone has to sacrifice.

114
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,680
You're right.

115
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,560
You're right.

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
So these lowly women

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,880
It's their great honor

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,360
to sacrifice my face.

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,440
You're crazy.

120
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
So what?

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,280
This is good.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,440
Don't let her die too soon.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes.

124
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh, my. Hey.

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
What?

126
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
You don't like it?

127
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,159
Are you worried about Xie?

128
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,240
Don't worry.

129
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,200
As long as he practices hard,

130
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,799
he will recover soon.

131
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
I know.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Are you afraid

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,500
after he recovers,

134
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,400
after he recovered.

135
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,720
He’ll die.

136
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,280
Thank you.

137
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
is more crazy than we thought.

138
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Do you remember when you were looking for me in Lu City,

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,800
you saved some missing girls?

140
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,280
I remember.

141
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,720
those girls were pitiful.

142
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,440
They were all

143
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
for prostitution.

144
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
They're not the only ones

145
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
They are not the only ones who were abducted.

146
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,240
Many people

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,000
are dead.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Dead or dead?

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,160
Really?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
I remember

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,520
there's a manual in the library of Laundry Valley.

152
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,800
It records

153
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,520
to cultivate alchemy with the girl's blood

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
to preserve youth forever.

155
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
You mean...

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,080
Huarong killing?

157
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
That’s right.

158
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,840
Where did Xie Cizhou find this secret technique?

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
He searched a lot of girls in secret to make alchemy.

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,240
for a long time.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
But I was found recently.

162
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,780
How could this happen?

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
What's going on?

164
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,440
Impossible.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,800
No way.

166
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,280
This is absolutely impossible.

167
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
Father.

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
Do you know something?

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,400
Where did you get that manual?

170
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
This flower-face killing

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,760
to a certain extent,

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
not only can it make people look young,

173
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,360
but also

174
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
it can improve his power.

175
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,980
Actually, my daughter...

176
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
I wrote

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,920
when I was young.

178
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
At that time,

179
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,040
just to be famous,

180
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,840
but I forgot that practicing witchcraft is not done by the right way.

181
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,880
After I developed the Hua Rong killing,

182
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
I traveled around.

183
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
I met a mysterious girl.

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,560
A drunken talk

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,440
and bragged about it to her.

186
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,280
But...

187
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,600
I think

188
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,440
that was just nonsense when I was young.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,120
It's all my fault.

190
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,320
In this world,

191
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
such a coincidence.

192
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,240
No matter what,

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
I...

194
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,160
for this.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,560
Father.

196
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,450
This is not the time to blame yourself.

197
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,770
If you really want to end this tragedy,

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,040
we can't let Xie Ciyuan

199
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,480
we can't stand by and do nothing.

200
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,680
You're right.

201
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
Now,

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
kill Xie Cizhou

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
to the world,

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,520
to the people,

205
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,440
for the people

206
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,320
to those innocent girls.

207
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
How about this?

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,720
Come with me to fetch the Millennial Refinement Flower.

209
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,480
and give it to Xie.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
It will last ten thousand years.

211
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,080
There is only one flower in the valley.

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,940
The one who takes it can increase one armor of power.

213
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,760
Father.

214
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,980
Are you sure you want to give it to him?

215
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Maybe this is fate.

216
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,480
It can only be used

217
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,120
Only those with broken heart can take it.

218
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Perfect.

219
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
Xie

220
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
is the best candidate.

221
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,040
At this point,

222
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,200
I hope

223
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,530
as soon as possible.

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,840
This debt
