1
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,440
That's the undying flower!

2
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
I can't believe

3
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,240
to this extent.

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,360
Stop it!

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,880
Si-an.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,410
Why are you fighting with an outsider?

7
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,120
We're just sparring.

8
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,640
Come with me.

9
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,600
Look at you.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,840
Why do you have to fight him to death?

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Isn’t it good to fight Xie Cizhou?

12
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,880
I’ll do my best

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
I’ll do my best.

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,340
But I will protect you.

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,840
to protect you.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,760
Don't be silly.

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
I don't need you to die for me.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,920
I want you to live well.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Deal.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,300
It's been a day and a night.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
He's not talking.

22
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Not moving

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Should I say it or not?

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,440
She's so pretty.

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
Even if she's like a piece of wood,

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
standing here,

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
if you stand here.

28
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,760
She's the culprit of the City Governor. Don't kill her.

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,040
If you don't want to lose your head,

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
don't think about anything you shouldn't have.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,480
We're just chatting.

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
Gentlemen,

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,490
could you please

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,320
give me some water?

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
What are you trying to do?

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm already like this.

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,400
what else can I do?

38
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,720
I just want some water.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,079
Can't you give me this?

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,570
Thank you, brother.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,040
Thank you. Thank you.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Thank you so much.

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,340
Who broke into the valley?

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
It's you.

45
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
♪The feeling of love♪ ♪The feeling of love♪

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
If you saw Mu Wan

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,120
was taken away by Mu Wan,

48
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
I believe you not only want to kill her,

49
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,200
but also yourself

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,060
should pay with your life.

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,580
I don't care about others.

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
But this woman

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,120
can never enter my Laundry Valley.

54
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Otherwise, I can’t guarantee

55
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,159
if my fan can still be kept.

56
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Master.

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,920
Ruyue is back.

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Go to find Chu and gather at Nameless Pavilion.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,720
It's time for me to leave.

60
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,600
I heard Yoo Ruyue was here.

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,920
but Si-an didn't let her in.

62
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,520
She was only

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,660
She's just following orders.

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm the culprit.

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,440
You're quite defending her.

66
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,170
We are just master and servant.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
Nothing else.

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Do you think

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,560
I care?

70
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,640
You're right.

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,650
You shouldn't care about that.

72
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,640
I don’t want to mention the past.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
I don’t want to

74
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
I don’t want to get involved.

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
The most important thing now

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,680
is to solve Xie Cizhou.

77
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Three days later,

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,800
is the anniversary of my father's death.

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,130
At this time every year,

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Xie Cizhou will hold a ceremony.

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,240
I think

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
it will be the best chance to use your phone.

83
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
This Xie Cizhou

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,330
is really interesting.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
You wanted to kill your father to seize the throne,

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,940
but I'm afraid people will accuse me.

87
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
and make a grand ceremony.

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
I don't know.

89
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
whether this is comforting the dead

90
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,920
or pretending to be alive?

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
Who knows?

92
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,320
I've been fighting her in secret for so many years.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
I thought I knew her well.

94
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
But in the end,

95
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
I knew nothing about her.

96
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Do you think you can come back alive?

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
If I die,

98
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,400
will your hatred

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,200
dissipate?

100
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,160
No.

101
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,520
I told you

102
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,280
If you die,

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,760
I will only hate you more.

104
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,280
Because you made my sacrifice meaningless.

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,600
I've kept the blood of my heart for so many years to save you.

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
You must live.

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,970
Thousands of arrows pierce the heart.

108
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,520
Live in agony.

109
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay.

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
I promise you.

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,610
Father! Father!

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Daughter! Father!

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
What happened?

114
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Soldiers from Pingcheng are coming.

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
What happened?

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
I don’t know where

117
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,400
found the entrance to Laundry Valley.

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,060
Now this place is surrounded.

119
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,680
We can only retreat from the back mountain.

120
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,440
You go first.

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
I want to protect the disciples.

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720
You can’t go.

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,880
Just leave with him.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm the young master of Laundry Valley.

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,650
How can I be afraid of death?

127
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,440
We'll take some men to cover the rear.

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
Take Mianwan away.

129
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,320
Remember,

130
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
you must protect my daughter.

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,200
Consider it a way to repay me for saving my life.

132
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,600
Don't worry.

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,610
I will protect you with my life.

134
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
I wonder if Liu Ruyue

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
is useful.

136
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,799
Don't worry, Master Rong.

137
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,840
For Xie Ciyuan,

138
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
she will do as you wish.

139
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,539
She is Wufeng’s most proud subordinate,

140
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,140
and the best assassin in Nameless Pavilion.

141
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
I really want to see

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,240
how Xie Ciyuan would feel

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,320
how would he look like?

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Will you

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,400
betray me?

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,800
I will never betray you.

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Even if I die,

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,020
this life belongs to Master Rong.

149
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,600
You're awake.

150
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,540
How is the Laundry Valley?

151
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,300
Where are my father and Si-an?

152
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
Mr. Fang.

153
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
was taken away by Xie Cizhou.

154
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,280
Si-an is missing.

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,280
but I already sent someone to look for him.

156
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,960
Si-an should be fine.

157
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
I have to save my father.

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Yao, calm down.

159
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,480
Although my father is good at using poison,

160
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,140
he's not good at martial arts.

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,880
If the poison for self-protection

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
was also searched and taken,

163
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,560
He’s no match for Xie Cizhou.

164
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
Xie Ciyuan.

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,320
I need to save him.

166
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
I have to save him.

167
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,400
I know.

168
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,920
But calm down.

169
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
The City Governor's mansion is heavily guarded.

170
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Xie Cizhou came prepared

171
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,560
to deal with us.

172
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
If you go there rashly,

173
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,360
you'll be in danger.

174
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,800
I can’t just do nothing.

175
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
Yao.

176
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Trust me.

177
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,170
I'll figure something out.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
Prince Xuanping.

179
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,960
Aren't you dead?

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,680
It’s a long story.

181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Commander Lu.

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
How have you been?

183
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,680
Why do you say that?

184
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,920
I've never met him.

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Commander Lu.

186
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,080
Do you remember the token

187
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
I received?

188
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,280
You are...

189
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,280
To be honest,

190
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I am the master of Nameless Pavilion.

191
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Wufeng.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,120
You...

193
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,080
No wonder.

194
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
No wonder you can find me.

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
I came here today

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,200
to ask you

197
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
to Commander Lu.

198
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,400
You're welcome, Your Highness.

199
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,440
Just let me know if you need anything.

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
I'll do anything

201
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
at any cost.

202
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,600
What’s wrong?

203
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,130
Master was ambushed by Xie Cizhou.

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,770
We don’t know if he’s alive.

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
Impossible.

206
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
Didn't he say he won't act rashly

207
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,100
before the time comes?

208
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
How could he be ambushed by Xie Cizhou?

209
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Where is he now?

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,320
The City Governor's Residence.

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,040
I don't know the details.

212
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,800
Will you go with me

213
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
to find out the truth?

214
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,450
Let's go.

215
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
I told you

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,560
No one can be trusted.
