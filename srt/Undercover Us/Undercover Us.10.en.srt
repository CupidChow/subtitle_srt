1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,240
You're a good man. You're a good man.

2
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,840
Li Yan only knows how to eat, drink and gamble.

3
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,880
He made such a big mistake this time.

4
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
why didn't you give the order to investigate thoroughly?

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,810
Is it because he is the son of the Grand Preceptor?

6
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,000
The way of governance

7
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
is to balance.

8
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,400
You know that docile is like killing a son.

9
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,920
It's the same for the officials.

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,120
As long as they are still under my control,

11
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,240
some shortcomings

12
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,800
It can be used as a countermeasure.

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,759
Minister is here.

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Master Rong.

15
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,479
I heard that your attendant

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,880
accidentally died.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,720
I’m afraid you don’t have your own people.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
so I found another one for you.

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
Chuan, Qinglin.

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
You may leave now.

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,280
Yes.

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,880
Since you are a subject,

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,360
do you know what is proper?

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,560
You're wrong. You're wrong.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,640
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,880
I failed to teach my son well.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,120
From now on, I'll make my son fulfill his duty.

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,040
I won't let you worry anymore.

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
It's easy to be devoted to your duty.

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,360
I heard that many girls

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
in Pingcheng recently.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,250
were secretly transported to Lu City.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Why don't you go in person...

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,240
to give the people of Yun an explanation?

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,360
What?

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,480
You don't want to?

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
I agreed on behalf of my son.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
I will ask him

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
the missing person case.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
It's clean.

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
I accept it.

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,240
You two take care of it.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't forget your promise to me.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,160
I will find out the truth.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,760
and find out the truth.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,920
You still won't admit it?

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,520
Behave yourself.

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Commander Lu.

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,200
You are a prisoner now.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,300
Do you understand?

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
I will never

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
live up to my conscience.

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,000
and the people.

55
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,800
You traitors!

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,720
You'll be punished

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,839
You will be punished one day.

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,120
Who are you?

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,970
Someone broke into the prison!

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,280
We don't have time.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,159
We mean no harm.

62
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,330
Let's talk outside.

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,880
Who are you?

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,250
Nameless Pavilion.

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,760
Take it.

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,760
to any place

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,720
any place

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,120
find a shelter,

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,700
someone will help you.

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
I

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,240
for more than ten years,

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,960
But I didn't expect to die unjustly.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
I didn't expect

74
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,400
to be the enemy in the end.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
in the end.

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,090
The world is unfair.

77
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,850
That's why the nameless Pavilion exists.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,720
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,240
Hello.

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,920
See you later.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,720
I heard that

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,420
Nameless Pavilion is investigating the missing girl.

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
I have a clue.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
I wonder

85
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
for you two?

86
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,800
Go ahead.

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,130
The governor of Lu City and Li Rui are cousins.

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,240
This place is drunk.

89
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,420
and many high-ranking officials

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,320
are particularly concentrated.

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,040
Li Yan made a mistake when he was drunk.

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
He said his family

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
in this place.

94
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,640
I suspect

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
has something to do with the missing girls.

96
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
Big deal.

97
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,320
Li Yan is the lieutenant.

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
He has the power to open the city gate

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
and have the right to open the city gate at will.

100
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,720
Although it is risky

101
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
is risky,

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,080
But if you take advantage of your position,

103
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
in the middle of the night,

104
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,280
when the night is quiet,

105
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,440
it won't attract attention.

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,760
That's right.

107
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,920
The one who escorted the carriage out of the city that night

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
was the Shenwu Guard.

109
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,080
A trusted aide of the lieutenant

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,840
to participate in the kidnapping case in public.

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Everything is so unusual.

112
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Besides,

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,320
the Lucheng Festival is quite complicated.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,400
Other than Shangyuan of the old calendar,

115
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Dan Oh.

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,260
On festivals like Qixi Festival,

117
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,960
they will specially pick

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
to hold a torch festival.

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,020
A feast like the lantern festival

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,920
Gather all the officials to celebrate.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,880
A high-ranking official.

122
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,040
He's drunk.

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Looks like the big deal

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,080
involves a lot.

125
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,120
Master Lin,

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
What should we do with this?

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,800
The Li family and his son are involved in this case.

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,560
But the connection network is complicated.

129
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,260
How about this?

130
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,360
You two go to Lu City

131
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,120
and find out who's involved.

132
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
If necessary,

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
when necessary.

134
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,570
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Be careful.

137
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,080
Yes.

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,000
It's dawn after a long night.

139
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm so sleepy.

140
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,640
Do you think people in the mansion know

141
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,159
that His Highness and Her Highness sleep until the sun rises.

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,919
Is it because they went out to be killers in the middle of the night?

143
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
They will think

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
their lords and consorts

145
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,920
are very close.

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,240
Night and night.

147
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,620
Here you are. Here you are.

148
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
What do you think?

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
Maybe in the near future,

150
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,600
after the divorce agreement is completed,

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,800
your queen will belong to someone else.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you really want to escape from me?

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
What?

154
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,400
You sound as if you miss me.

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Si Yao.

156
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
I've thought it through.

157
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,050
I don't want to divorce you.

158
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
What?

159
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,570
Do we have to fight to get a divorce?

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
I want to

161
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
forever.

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
until death do us part.

163
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
Bad news!

164
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,480
Your Highness!

165
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
His Highness is in trouble.

166
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,600
Small pox?

167
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,720
Really?

168
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,760
It's true.

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,440
I dare not lie to you.

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
The doctor has checked his pulse.

171
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,520
He said His Highness might have contracted smallpox.

172
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,080
Now the entire Xuanping Mansion is doomed.

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
Please give the order.

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
to save us poor servants.

175
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,180
What about that woman?

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
The princess and the prince are deeply in love.

177
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
She refuses to leave you.

178
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,880
No one dares to approach you except her.

179
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,080
They are still in the mansion.

180
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,360
Mother.

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
The smallpox is very fierce.

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
It's very contagious.

183
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,120
If anything goes wrong,

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,250
the whole Ping City will be in trouble.

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,440
We need to plan ahead.

186
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,720
Qinglin.

187
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,360
Go.

188
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,290
Seal all the exits in Prince Xuanping's Mansion.

189
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Yes.

190
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
Master Rong, this is...

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,000
Whether they can survive

192
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
depends on fate.

193
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,600
I heard Xie Cizhou sealed the gate of the mansion.

194
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,880
He wants to trap us in there.

195
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,360
Your sister

196
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
really lived up to her ruthless name.

197
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,320
She even killed her biological father.

198
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,880
My half-brother

199
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
is nothing.

200
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,480
By the way,

201
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,520
The lantern festival is in two days.

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
All the high officials and nobles

203
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,960
will come to Lu City.

204
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,220
I believe at that time,

205
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,920
we will gain a lot.
