1
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,280
You're wrong.

2
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,730
You belong to me from beginning to end.

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,520
No!

4
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,840
Let go of her!

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,880
Xie Ci Yuan!

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,760
I'll kill you!

7
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,960
Master!

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
You're awake.

9
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,720
Where is Si Yao?

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,530
Doctor Qin detoxified you.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,160
Use your power to see

12
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,880
Is there anything wrong?

13
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
How did

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
my poison?

15
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,360
Of course it's Dr. Qin's method.

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
So,

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,079
She is...

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
She...

19
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
She is...

20
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,120
She...

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
She was taken away.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,120
You just watch her

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,040
take her away?

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,680
If she wants to leave,

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
how can we stop her?

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,730
She belongs to the Laundry Valley.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,240
She doesn't belong to the nameless Pavilion.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,320
She doesn't belong anywhere.

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,600
She only belongs to me.

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,480
And you.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,360
You still won't tell me the truth.

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,920
How did

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
my poison?

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Did you use Si Yao’s heart blood?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Tell me.

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,120
So what?

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
I took her heart blood.

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,079
a whole bottle.

39
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,240
If you want me to pay with her life,

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,240
do it now.

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,200
Chief.

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,840
I did everything for you.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,079
to save you.

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Besides,

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,760
Si Yao was rescued by people from the Laundry Valley.

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,440
Then Fang Yu's medical skills

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,120
can be killed.

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,420
I won’t let anything happen to Si Yao.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
The one who really hurts her

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
It’s me.

51
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Muwan.

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,120
You're awake.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Si-an.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,560
I'm here.

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
You remember?

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,200
You know who I am?

57
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,480
It hurts.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
It hurts, right?

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,500
The blood in my heart is no different.

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Your vitality is badly injured this time.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
You need a good rest to recover.

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,280
I'll go find Master.

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Let me give you acupuncture.

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
What's wrong?

65
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,520
Where is Xie Ci Yuan?

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,720
Why mention him?

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,760
He tricked you while you lost your memory.

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,320
and hurt you so much.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,040
It's not too much to cut you into pieces.

70
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,100
Are you still thinking about him?

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
Do you know

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,640
if I were one step late,

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,400
you would have died.

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Missing?

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
I do care about his life.

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,120
He lied to me and set me up.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,040
I was afraid he would die too easily

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,120
I won't have the chance to avenge myself.

79
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Don’t worry.

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,760
Xie Ci Yuan hurt you so much.

81
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,960
I will

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,320
I'll seek justice from him.

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,280
But the most important thing now

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
take a good rest.

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
We'll take our time.

86
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
It's all my fault.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,360
I made you suffer so much.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
You're better than me.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,000
If you

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
practice more

92
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
you can be more diligent.

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,960
you wouldn't have lost to me.

94
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
Stop nagging.

95
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,400
Why should I work so hard?

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,040
I have you by my side.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
It's enough to have me by your side.

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,409
As for martial arts,

99
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
it's not just one day.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,860
Let's do it slowly.

101
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
Remember,

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,200
This is your arena.

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
You don't have time to study.

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,760
You can only live

105
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
can you live.

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
From now on,

107
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,980
you are the new killer of the nameless Pavilion.

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
Si Yao.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
Si Yao.

110
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,250
It's all in the past.

111
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
I won't let you get hurt again.

112
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
I promise.

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,080
Thank you.

114
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,160
Nameless Pavilion.

115
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
I won't let anyone off.

116
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,440
Take a good rest.

117
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,770
I'll inform Master that you're awake.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Si-an.

119
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,440
Yes?

120
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
Tell my father

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
I want to go home.

122
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,960
Okay.

123
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
Master.

124
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
What did you say? What did you say?

125
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,680
just now.

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,080
Mianwan wakes up

127
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,360
It means she’s getting better.

128
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
Let's go back to the racket tomorrow morning.

129
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Yes, Master.

130
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,600
The most important thing

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
is to recuperate Mianwan.

132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Over the past year,

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
She suffered a lot.

134
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
The information of the nameless Pavilion

135
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
and Xie Ciyuan's identity

136
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960
and Xie Xifan.

137
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,280
I've sent them to the City Governor's Residence.

138
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,010
If you dare to hurt my daughter,

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,760
you have to pay the price.

140
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,320
How dare you come?

141
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
This is between me and him.

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Let me solve it myself.

143
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,280
Sorry.

144
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,170
About the antidote,

145
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,920
You're too kind.

148
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,120
You're a prince.

149
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,360
You're a noble lady.

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,680
to kill me.

151
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,760
to kill me.

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,760
After all, I'm not good enough for you.

153
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,560
It's worth your effort

154
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
to let my guard down

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
and make me love you.

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,200
to keep me in the mansion

157
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,160
to keep me in the mansion

158
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,200
to get close to me as a killer.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,520
but never told me

160
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,320
that you are Wufeng.

161
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,440
You worked with Liu Ruyue

162
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,200
to take blood from me.

163
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,840
What a good plan.

164
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,000
The ambiguous entanglement

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
and share weal and woe.

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,500
and live and die together.

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,160
were all plots?

168
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,240
In the end, I was too stupid.

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,800
Liu Ruyue told me

170
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
to be a killer,

171
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,160
you must never trust anyone.

172
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,880
But I trusted you.

173
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Xie Ciyuan.

174
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,720
I won't kill you.

175
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,640
Because your life

176
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,040
was saved by my heart blood.

177
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,680
You don't deserve to die.

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,480
You must live.

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,160
But I will never forgive you.

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Never.

181
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
If you hate me,

182
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,360
will make you feel better.

183
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,400
Then hate me.

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,540
You're the only one

185
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,080
Only you signed it.

186
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,300
is called Divorce Agreement.

187
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,880
not a divorce.

188
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,760
Si Yao is dead.

189
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,600
From now on,

190
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,680
when we meet,

191
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,120
Don't blame me for being merciless.
