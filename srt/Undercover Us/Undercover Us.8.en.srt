1
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,560
I heard that you went to Qifeng Restaurant

2
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,490
you went to Qifeng Pavilion today.

3
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,680
His Highness has been having insomnia lately.

4
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm worried.

5
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
I heard that Xiaoyu

6
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,720
has a secret sleeping incense.

7
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
It's the favorite flavor

8
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,120
in Qifeng Pavilion.

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,520
That's why

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,720
go ask her for incense.

11
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,560
I did do something wrong.

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
Are you angry, Your Highness?

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,160
Prince Xuanping doesn't have so many rules.

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,520
Just do whatever you want.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,400
Just do it.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Master Lin,

17
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,120
in the sachet,

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,080
there is also a very rare dragon knot grass.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,360
Since you care so much about me,

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,760
I should return the favor.

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
I'll take you to a good place.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Qinglin

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
is either monitoring me

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,320
or Xie Ciyuan.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
We can't go on like this.

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
We have to find a chance to get him away.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,060
Your Highness.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,560
Where are you going?

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm taking her out

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,079
alone.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,020
Are you going to follow me even if you don't know?

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,360
Boss.

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,090
Have you seen this girl?

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,320
No.

35
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,240
Buns for sale!

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
Fresh steamed buns

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,850
Come and have a look.

38
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Sorry.

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,090
I mistook you for someone else.

40
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,680
How did you find this place?

41
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
This is too hidden.

42
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,440
This is a secret place

43
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,290
my mother gave me in childhood.

44
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
I've never brought anyone here.

45
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
So,

46
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,970
no one knows this place.

47
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
You're the first one.

48
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,320
Why are you so nice to me?

49
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
Because the queen

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,420
is different from others.

51
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,680
You're glib-tongued.

52
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,840
Maybe

53
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
the entrance to Laundry Valley is in Longyu Mountain.

54
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,400
I don't know

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,570
if she can remember something.

56
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,560
What are you looking at?

57
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,680
Look, Your Highness.

58
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,120
It's a herb

59
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,450
It's called winter.

60
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,040
It usually grows at the top of the cliff.

61
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,640
It needs to be underneath the trees.

62
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,800
under the trees.

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,760
I didn't expect to meet you here.

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,320
It has such a good growth.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
Since it's so rare,

66
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
I'll take it back for you.

67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,440
No.

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
The autumn result

69
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
Flowers bloom in spring.

70
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
When it blooms,

71
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
is the real winter.

72
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,080
You know so much about herbs.

73
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Did she learn medicine?

74
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
Yes.

75
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes.

76
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,200
I heard there is a mysterious place

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
there seems to be a mysterious place

78
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
called Laundry Valley.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,330
People in the valley are good at medicine.

80
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,000
They are all rare talents.

81
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Have you

82
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
heard of it?

83
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,000
Laundry Valley?

84
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,730
Princess Consort, do you remember anything?

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,480
Should I remember something?

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
For example,

87
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,159
your background,

88
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
Or

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
your past

90
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,159
your past.

91
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,580
Princess Consort.

92
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
I don't remember.

93
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,770
I don't remember anything.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Okay.

95
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,280
Don't think about it if you can't remember.

96
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll take you back now.

97
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,940
Your Highness.

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
A few days ago, in that carriage,

99
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,900
in the carriage a few days ago.

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
We have to find them as soon as possible.

101
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,600
I know.

102
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Master Lin has sent someone to investigate.

103
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,560
I guess that car

104
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
will go south along Lu City.

105
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
Deer City is the most prosperous place

106
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,120
That is the most bustling city

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,040
and the most convenient city for transportation.

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,760
If those girls were abducted,

109
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
Lu City

110
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,640
is definitely a perfect central location.

111
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,850
It's easy to transport people around.

112
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,720
According to the news from Nameless Pavilion,

113
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
the guard of Lu City

114
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,919
seems to work for Li Rui.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,400
Li Rui is a great minister.

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
and powerful.

117
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,360
If this is related to him,

118
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
we need to find out the truth.

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm warning you.

120
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Don't think about going out when you come in.

121
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
If anyone runs away,

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,680
I'll kill him.

123
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
I have plenty of ways

124
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,400
to deal with you.

125
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,160
That girl

126
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,240
crying and looking for death.

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
So what?

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
You have to receive my guests.

129
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
So,

130
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,760
I advise you to behave yourself.

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
In this way,

132
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,800
you'll suffer less.

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,520
Who are you?

134
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Sir.

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Please save us.

136
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,240
Please.

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,970
Don't worry.

138
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,330
I'll send someone to send you home.

139
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,320
Thank you, sir.

140
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
Recently,

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,360
several batches of women who were abducted from Pingcheng

142
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
and sent to Lu City.

143
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
didn't find you.

144
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I’m incompetent.

145
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,680
Please punish me.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,320
It’s not your fault.

147
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
No one wants Mianwan to die.

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,920
Over the past year,

149
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
we've been inquiring about her.

150
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
As long as the body is not found,

151
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
that means Mianwan is still alive.

152
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,920
I will find Young Master.

153
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,840
How about this?

154
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,680
Send those girls

155
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,140
back to Pingcheng safely.

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,560
No matter what,

157
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
I couldn't find my daughter.

158
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,240
It's a good thing

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
to save someone's daughter.

160
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,020
Your Highness.

161
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,440
I had a nightmare.

162
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm so scared.

163
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm here.

164
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,880
Madam.

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,810
Don't be afraid.

166
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's go.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,080
A man

168
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,560
listening to the corners every day.

169
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
How shameless.

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
In order to thank him,

171
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,360
let alone let him listen to the corners,

172
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,240
Even if we let him jump off the city tower,

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
he won't complain.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,120
He's gone.

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,980
Why are you still holding her?

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,600
What do you think I want?

177
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,360
Her expression

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,000
looks a little disappointed.

179
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
Get some rest.

180
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm going out.

181
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,160
You...

182
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,410
Where are you going?

183
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,880
It's not a good idea

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
in the royal mansion.

185
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,160
I have to

186
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,360
out.

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,240
What's wrong?

188
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
Nothing.

189
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,280
I was shocked by your charisma.

190
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,440
I was distracted.

191
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,720
Please forgive me.
