1
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,410
Why are you here?

2
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
I heard that father punished you to stay up late to practice.

3
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,720
You're not allowed to have dinner.

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,240
I brought you some snacks.

5
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,040
Eat slowly.

6
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
It's all yours.

7
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,200
It's almost dawn.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,440
Go back and rest.

9
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
If Master finds out,

10
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,860
he'll scold you again.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,320
You have to get up to practice at dawn anyway.

12
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
How about

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
Let's go see the sunrise.

14
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Okay.

15
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,600
No.

16
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,640
I don’t know

17
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
what he has drugged you.

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
to make you so confused?

19
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Father and mother fell in love at first sight and married.

20
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
My mother died young.

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
My father has been single for more than 20 years.

22
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,520
You call that stupid?

23
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
It's not the same.

24
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
Your mother and I love each other.

25
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
We didn't involve in any deception and interests.

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
But even with deception and interests,

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,040
then...

28
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
I'm in love.

29
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm in love.

30
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Father.

31
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
I know

32
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm sorry for your teaching.

33
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
But I really can't

34
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,640
watch him die in front of me.

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,520
I just want him to live.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
even if we never meet again.

37
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,079
even if

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
even if he's in a noble position.

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,839
I can retire

40
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,360
I can be enemies.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,640
I just want him to live.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,530
Have you ever thought about

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,640
Si-an's feelings?

44
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,640
I owe him.

45
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,180
I'll find a way to pay him back.

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
Silly girl.

47
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,960
All the debts in this world

48
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,320
is the most difficult to repay.

49
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,520
How?

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,680
How?

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,520
How can I afford it?

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,760
I'll take care of

53
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,160
I'll take care of it.

54
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
Father, don't worry.

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,120
When Xie Ciyuan recovers,

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
I'll kick him out immediately.

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,730
I won't stay any longer.

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Daughter.

59
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
She's so stubborn

60
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,840
is just like her dead mother.

61
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Lan'er,

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Our daughter has grown up.

63
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,640
Will you blame me

64
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,170
for not taking good care of her?

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
You shouldn't have come.

66
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,160
If you do this,

67
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,200
I can't hate you anymore.

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
About the wedding...

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
I was selfish.

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,659
No matter what,

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,880
you don't have to apologize for your decision.

73
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,340
Even if you're not my wife,

74
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,020
you're still my young master.

75
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
I won't disobey you.

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Si-an.

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,000
Your life

78
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,120
should live for yourself.

79
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
My life is for you.

80
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,400
Muwan.

81
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,880
Remember you said

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,720
you don’t love Xie Ciyuan,

83
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,400
but hatred?

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,440
Whether I love him or hate him,

85
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
it's between us.

86
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,240
I don't want to talk about this with you.

87
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,000
You said it's between you two.

88
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,250
You protect him in your territory.

89
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,960
What about me?

90
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,480
What did I do wrong?

91
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,000
You excluded me from your life.

92
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,560
We agreed to walk side by side.

93
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,420
Don't force me to do it.

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,530
You’ve really changed.

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
If Fang Muwan

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
wouldn’t do this to me.

97
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
It's my fault.

99
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,720
Xie Ciyuan missed his identity at the wedding.

100
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Xie Cizhou will find him soon.

101
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,770
For the sake of Laundry Valley,

102
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,760
we must plan ahead.

103
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,559
Got it.

104
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
Why him?

105
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,920
What's so good about him?

106
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
He's not that good.

107
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
But it can only be him.

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
No one else.

109
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Yao.

110
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,520
Yao.

111
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Yao.

112
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,280
Yao.

113
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,780
You’re badly injured.

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Your organs are damaged.

115
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Don't move.

116
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,440
In my dream,

117
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
in my dream.

118
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,520
But only in dream

119
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,160
in my dream.

120
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,800
How could it be her?

121
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
She will never come back.

122
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,840
My Yao hates me so much.

123
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,680
He will never come back.

124
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Don't be silly.

125
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,920
I know I'm not qualified to talk about love.

126
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,120
But I still want to be with you.

127
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
Even if it's just a dream.

128
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,480
even in a dream.

129
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Don't leave me.
