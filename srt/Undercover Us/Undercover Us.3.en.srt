1
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,920
Master Rong.

2
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,520
Because of the assassin of Nameless Pavilion

3
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,720
sneaked into Prince Xuanping's mansion.

4
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,039
Lord Qinglin led the team

5
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,360
and the lieutenant's mansion

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,440
the two strongholds of Nameless Pavilion.

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,760
But the clues have been cut off.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,420
We need to investigate again.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,460
Keep investigating then.

10
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,640
I will remove

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,039
one by one.

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,039
Yes.

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,000
Master Rong,

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,200
a new book has been spreading in the city recently.

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,440
The words in the book are fierce.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
How dare you slander Master Rong

17
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,080
and spread false rumors

18
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,800
and disrupt the people's morale.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
I think

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,860
we can't underestimate this matter.

21
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,560
In this world,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,400
there are always people who are unwilling to be lonely

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
with a pen as a sword.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,520
and stab the powerful.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,260
Master Rong, you're wise.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
Such nonsense

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,970
If we don't suppress it,

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm afraid there will be a disaster.

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
May I ask

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,280
please give the order

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,640
to investigate this matter thoroughly.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,970
Punish him severely. Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
Lord Li.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,400
You're wrong.

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't need to know their origin.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
And I don't need to care

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,440
what their motive is.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,520
They need freedom.

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
But freedom

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,760
has to pay the price.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
Pass my order.

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,970
From today onwards,

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
anyone who participates in the publication of this book

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,640
and spread

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,440
The people who wrote it

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
No matter the rank,

47
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,840
or status,

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,360
the main criminal will be executed.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,840
The accomplice will be exiled to the border.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
and never return to Yunzhou.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,920
Yes.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,560
She ordered

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,560
more than 300 people suffered.

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,320
Your Highness.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,520
Are you going to do it?

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Chu Yi.

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,760
Gather some men.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
and exile families.

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
and save

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,720
on the way.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Yes.

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,180
Your Highness.

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
I don't like the food.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Nan Gardenia.

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,480
Do you know where His Highness is?

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,079
It turns out that she doesn't eat or eat

67
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,760
because she misses you.

68
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,040
Something so serious happened in the mansion the night before yesterday.

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,920
His Highness went to

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,640
in the morning.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,079
He was worried that it might affect your rest.

72
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,540
He specifically asked us not to disturb you.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
Rumor has it that

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Xie Cizhou

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
and indulged him.

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,320
But Xie Ciyuan's attitude is very repeated.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,920
He was able to

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,720
who met me once

79
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,240
and contradicted Master Rong.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,400
but afraid of Xie Cizhou.

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
Because this sudden assassin

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,780
because of this sudden assassin.

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,040
What kind of feeling

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,680
Xie Cizhou?

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
Is it because

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,640
or just pretending?

87
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,079
There must be

88
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,440
must have a secret.

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Uncle Wang has been waiting here for four hours.

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,159
Aren't you going back?

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,760
I want to wait.

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Mother has accepted the letter of apology.

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,320
But I'm busy today.

94
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
I can't make it to see Uncle Wang.

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,800
You should go back first.

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,280
Today is the fifth day of the lunar month.

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
It should be the day I meet my mother.

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,320
If you can't go with me,

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,840
I can go by myself.

100
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,760
Uncle Wang, you must be joking.

101
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
Without my mother,

102
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm afraid you can't even enter

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,400
enter Jinchen Garden.

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
May I ask

105
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,560
I suggest you leave first.

106
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
After all,

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,800
is waiting for you.

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Since you can't serve your parents,

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,520
it's good to ask for a harmonious marriage.

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
Am I right?

111
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,480
Please

112
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,760
on behalf of my mother.

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,880
Sure.

114
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,820
Your Highness.

115
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,480
It's already late.

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Why isn't His Highness back yet?

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Did something happen at the City Governor's Residence today?

118
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

119
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,120
A servant reported that

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,440
His Highness has left the City Governor's Residence.

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,320
That's strange.

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
Why isn't he back yet?

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,240
Well...

124
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,240
Just say it.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
They said

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,600
His Highness went to Qifeng Pavilion

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,320
he went to Qifeng Pavilion.

128
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Mother.

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,360
One day,

130
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,500
I’ll take you away from Xie Cizhou

131
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
and leave Yunzhou.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Is His Highness really here?

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
You're just in time.

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,360
Come.

135
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Drink with me.

136
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,159
Why are you upset?

137
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,770
Did Master Rong punish you for what happened last night?

138
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm in a good mood.

139
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,480
Why would I be upset?

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,960
Come.

141
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,640
Let me show you a treasure.

142
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,360
This is

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
with all my money.

144
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,640
of the four famous Qin.

145
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Rao Liang.

146
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,260
Rumour has it that its sound is clear.

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,400
It's famous for being famous for three days.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me try the tone.

149
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,480
Are you going to play the zither

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,680
in front of everyone?

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,240
Why not?

152
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,010
This will disgrace the Xie family.

153
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,320
Please think twice, Your Highness.

154
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
The Xie family

155
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,159
of the Xie family.

156
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,080
It doesn't matter.

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,280
I know a little about music.

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,600
How about

159
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,480
accompany His Highness?

160
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Then...

161
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,940
Thank you, Your Highness.

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,400
These are Prince Xuanping and Princess Consort.

163
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,920
How can I watch them play?

164
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,140
Let's go upstairs.

165
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,700
This...

166
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
This is Wenjun’s night run.

167
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
That's right.

168
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,760
This is the poem "Wenjun Running at Night".

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,200
In the past,

170
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,840
A song for a beauty

171
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,880
Later, Wenjun went out at night.

172
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
to sell wine.

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,679
Honestly,

174
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,520
Your Highness and Your Highness

175
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,919
are indeed a good match.

176
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

177
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
A match made in heaven.

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
What a perfect match.

179
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,880
Sure.

180
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Wonderful

181
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,680
That's great.

182
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
I didn't know

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,560
you have such skills.

184
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
The playboy

185
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
is really a traitor.

186
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,240
Bad news!

187
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
Someone is dead!

188
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
My granddaughter.

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
Granddaughter.

190
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
these money

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,960
is enough for the rest of your life.

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,400
Don't be ungrateful.

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
My father is the Minister of Justice.

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,720
It's useless no matter where you sue him.

195
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
My granddaughter

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,480
just sells vegetables on the street

197
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
to support our family.

198
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,400
But this young master

199
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,440
by this young master.

200
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,960
She failed to resist,

201
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,040
she hit the pillar.

202
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,200
God.

203
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,480
What kind of world is this?

204
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,400
Where is justice?

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,760
Let me tell you.

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,880
I am justice.

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,940
Do you understand?

208
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,760
Are you going to just watch?

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,620
Minister of Justice belongs to Sister Wang.

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,080
Why should I get myself into trouble?

211
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
I felt sorry for him just now.

212
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,840
It seems that the poor must have something to hate.

213
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
The Xie siblings

214
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,680
are the same.

215
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Let's go.

216
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,960
It's not fun here.

217
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,760
Let's make it look better.

218
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,920
So what?

219
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,760
The Emperor is guilty of breaking the law.

220
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,560
As the son of an official,

221
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,480
how dare you disregard the law?

222
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,130
and disregard human lives.

223
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,040
What?

224
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
You want to go home with me?

225
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,440
Sure.

226
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
You still look pretty.

227
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,280
then come back

228
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,760
with me.

229
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,720
You stained my purple bamboo fan.

230
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
Do you think

231
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
deserve to die?

232
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,580
I was wondering who it was.

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,080
It's Prince Xuanping.

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,080
What?

235
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,960
Your Highness.

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,600
He's drunk.

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,080
and you're here to hunt girls.

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,280
Could it be

239
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,920
the beautiful lady from Qifeng Pavilion?

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,640
of Qifeng Pavilion.

241
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,760
I made you unhappy.

242
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,720
But I liked this girl first.

243
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
Your Highness.

244
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,840
[Are you trying to take her away?] [Are you trying to take her away?]

245
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,800
take away what you like?

246
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,480
Do you know

247
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,170
the person you just touched

248
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,880
is my new Princess Xuanping.

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,980
How many heads do you have?

250
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,440
How dare you insult her?

251
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Guards!

252
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,640
Kill him!

253
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,800
Your Highness.

254
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,200
Spare me, Your Highness.

255
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,600
I made a mistake.

256
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,080
and offended you.

257
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Please spare my life

258
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,880
please spare my life.

259
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
What about them?

260
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,160
Yes.

261
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,200
It's my fault.

262
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,330
I deserve to die.

263
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,410
I deserve to die.

264
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
Just confess.

265
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
If you are guilty,

266
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,640
you must be punished.

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,920
Am I right, Chu Yi?

268
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's go.

269
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,680
Bury him well.

270
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,860
Minister of Justice is Wang's trusted aide.

271
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Do you know the consequences of being nosy?

272
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,240
This scumbag is bullying people.

273
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,520
and kill people at will.

274
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,880
is just a

275
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
that you said.

276
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,160
I shouldn't have said anything.

277
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,040
Please forgive me.

278
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,040
I helped you today.

279
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
how will you

280
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,640
repay you?
