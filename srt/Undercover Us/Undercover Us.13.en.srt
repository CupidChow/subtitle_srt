1
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,489
Where's the sachet?

2
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,370
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

3
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm fine.

4
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm fine.

5
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,560
Wait for me here.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
I’ll go to the workshop to find a carriage.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We’ll go back to Pingcheng tonight.

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Your Highness.

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,520
I've left the herbs for seven days.

10
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,320
for the past seven days.

11
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,800
Do you have any other instructions?

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Are they all dead?

13
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Take care, Your Highness.

14
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm leaving.

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
When will His Highness

16
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
come back?

17
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,840
If you keep pretending,

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,700
We'll be exposed sooner or later.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
He won't.

20
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Master Rong is cautious.

21
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,760
Small pox is a severe infection.

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,280
Even if she is suspicious,

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,900
she would never come to the mansion to check.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,280
As long as it's not her or Qinglin,

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,600
I can handle it.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,040
Please bless me.

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,160
I hope Your Highness and Princess Consort are doing well.

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,220
and return safely.

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,440
Why are you here?

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
Did something happen in Pingcheng?

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,960
The fifteenth day is coming.

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,960
I was worried about Master's health.

33
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,400
so I brought Dr. Qin with me.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
Is there anything wrong with the Gu poison?

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,960
Just tell me.

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
Master Lin,

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,970
Although the Gu insects

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,480
is suppressed,

39
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,040
but it can't cure the root.

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,340
The more you force it to sleep,

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Next time,

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
the more painful it will be.

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
I believe

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,560
you already know.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
In this sachet,

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,040
the scent of the Millennial Dragon Cutting Grass has dissipated.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
It’s useless

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
is basically useless.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,720
Don't worry, Master.

50
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,320
Dr. Qin has checked all medical books

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,519
and found another cure.

52
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,240
What is it?

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
It’s from Si Yao. It’s from the heart.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Heart blood.

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,640
I remember you mentioned

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
Si Yao's blood

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,880
can make Gu insects sleep for a long time.

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,200
I guess

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,120
she has been taking the dragon formula for a long time.

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
That's why her blood works.

61
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
Si Yao’s heart blood

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
comes from the Millennial Dragon Weed.

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,600
The valley that is generated from spleen and stomach

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
and momentum.

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,800
Pay attention to the flow of the eight meridians.

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,159
Once you drink a bowl,

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,450
it can turn the poison into invisible.

68
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Si Yao

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,640
will die?

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
die?

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
Master, have you forgotten?

72
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,320
We left Si Yao

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,840
to cure your poison.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Now Dr. Qin

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,320
has found the best way.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
Why not?

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
I just think

78
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,440
if you can take the Millennial Dragon knot,

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,040
Si Yao must be

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,400
must be something.

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,640
If we can connect her with the Laundry Valley,

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,570
to ask you for the antidote,

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,240
to cure the poison.

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760
Master.

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,930
The poisonous insects are getting stronger.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
Your body can’t hold on.

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,400
But Si Yao...

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
She is in our hands now.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
Taking blood directly

90
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,600
is the safest way.

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Besides,

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
several mysterious foreigners

93
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,760
several mysterious foreigners appeared.

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
are looking for a girl

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,100
who went missing in Longyu Mountain.

96
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,640
There is no such coincidence in this world.

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
The person they are looking for

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,800
must be Si Yao.

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
If they find Si Yao,

100
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,640
we won't have a chance.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
May I ask

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
to ask you something.

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Do you have feelings for Si Yao?

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,770
Stop talking nonsense.

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,080
Please forgive me.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
But the 15th is coming.

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,159
We don't have much time left.

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Si Yao will

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,730
will come back to Pingcheng with me tomorrow.

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,440
You don’t need to

112
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,960
the antidote.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
I heard another batch of

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,760
were rescued yesterday.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,480
But we still haven't heard from the young master.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,000
Where did she go?

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Young Master.

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Where have you been

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,570
Where have you been?

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
I finally found you.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Young Master.

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,280
What's wrong?

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
It's Si-an.

124
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Si-an!

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,020
Why are you looking at me like a stranger?

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,740
What's wrong with you?

127
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,810
I don't know you.

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,520
Let go!

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,520
Who is he?

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,460
How could he know my martial arts skills so well?

131
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,240
May I ask

132
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,320
Why are you so rude to my wife?

133
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Wife?

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,480
How could she be your wife?

135
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,920
She’s my fiancée, Fang Muwan.

136
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
He has

137
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
mixed with various herbs.

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,360
and so familiar with Si Yao.

139
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Could it be

140
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,780
someone from the Laundry Valley?

141
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Could you explain to me

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,080
where this fiance came from?

143
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't know him.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
How could you not know me?

145
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
Please behave yourself.

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
If you take another step forward,

147
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,620
don't blame me for being rude.

148
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,280
Let's see

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,400
how you'll be rude.

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Sir,

151
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
I told you I don't know you.

152
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,440
Why are you still pushing me and my wife?

153
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Muwan.

154
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
How did you become like this?

155
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,940
Don't you remember me?

156
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Are you okay?

157
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,600
I don't care who you are.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
what your purpose is.

159
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,280
If you dare to follow us again,

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,050
I'll make your life miserable.

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,730
Let’s go.

162
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,280
Why doesn’t Muwan know me?

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,960
and being so close to a stranger?

164
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,760
There must be something wrong.

165
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,560
I will find out the truth.

166
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,080
Memory loss?

167
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
I’m incompetent.

168
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
I failed to bring Mu Wan back.

169
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,520
But don’t worry.

170
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,890
I’ve sent someone to keep an eye on her.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,610
I won’t let her leave again.

172
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,880
Have you checked

173
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
have you checked his identity?

174
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,560
Take the portrait and send a letter to Pingcheng.

175
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,420
I believe there will be news soon.

176
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,720
I wonder

177
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
what happened to Mianwan

178
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,690
during Mianwan’s disappearance.

179
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
However,

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
with her current condition,

181
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
ordinary drugs

182
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,560
won't work on her.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,440
To restore her memory,

184
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
acupuncture is the fastest.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,600
But she doesn't remember us now.

186
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm afraid...

187
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,600
it won't be that easy.

188
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
to lower her guard against us.

189
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
What should we do?

190
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,280
Fine.

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,100
As long as Mianwan is fine,

192
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,600
we can think about it.

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,480
The most important thing now

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,360
the kid beside her

195
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,560
must find out who he is as soon as possible.

196
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,320
Don't worry, Master.

197
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
I'll do it now.

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
How is he?

199
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
His relapse

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,580
is more serious than ever.

201
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,000
Fortunately, Master Lin was prepared

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
and brought me from Nameless Pavilion.

203
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Otherwise,

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,090
the consequences will be dire.

205
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Xie Ciyuan once said

206
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,800
that sachet can suppress Gu insects.

207
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,840
But I don't know why it has lost its effect.

208
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,520
Doctor Qin

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,880
Do something.

210
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Look at the chest.

211
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,170
The venomous insect has started to absorb the heart meridians.

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,090
If we don’t find a way to cure it,

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
I’m afraid

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
Let's go. Let's go.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
It backfired.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
How could it backfire?

217
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
Before this,

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,560
He's here.

219
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
We can start the antidote.

220
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,240
But if we

221
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,850
If anything goes wrong,

222
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,040
it's a life.

223
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
for a life.

224
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,240
Her life

225
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,280
was picked up by me at the foot of Dragon Bae Mountain.

226
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,920
It belongs to the nameless Pavilion.
