1
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
What are you doing? What are you doing here?

2
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,539
What's wrong with you?

3
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,160
I was distracted during a mission last night.

4
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
Someone scratched his face.

5
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,680
Come on.

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,160
Look.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look at this. Look at this.

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
It doesn't matter.

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,880
Her Highness is naturally beautiful.

11
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
She's pretty no matter what.

12
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,479
But how can I go out like this?

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,720
I have an idea.

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay.

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,400
Okay. Okay.

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
Okay.

17
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
What are you thinking about?

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Nothing.

19
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,600
You don't have to

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
in the future.

21
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
Muwan.

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
Let’s get married.

23
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,800
How did you find this place?

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,160
This is too hidden.

25
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
This is a secret place

26
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,650
my mother gave me in childhood.

27
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
I've never brought anyone here.

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
So,

29
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,410
no one knows this place.

30
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
You're the first one.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,260
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,520
Because the queen is different from others.

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,770
What's the difference?

34
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
Is she blind or missing her nose?

35
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,960
To me, the queen

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,160
to me.

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
So it's different.

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,040
You're glib-tongued.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
You probably

40
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,240
forgive me again.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
But it’s good.

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
I’m destined to die.

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Without you,

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
when you're not around.

45
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Chief.

46
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,519
Master Lin, look.

47
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,839
This is the Immortal Supreme Herb.

48
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,440
It's not as effective as a thousand-year-old dragon forming grass,

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,000
but if the match is appropriate,

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,360
it can also alleviate your heartbeat.

51
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Thank you, Dr. Qin.

52
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
You're welcome.

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,840
I'll go back now.

54
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,520
and make the medicine for you.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,480
Wait.

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
Where does it grow?

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,600
The Dragon Bae Mountain is north.

58
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,200
The upper reaches the water source.

59
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,440
That day,

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
the man in the Laundry Valley

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,780
has the smell of Xianzhi Reviving Grass.

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Could it be...

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
The entrance of the Laundry Valley

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,520
is near the water source.

65
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,280
Master Lin.

66
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,260
Let's get married.

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,850
Do you know what you're talking about?

68
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,730
what you're talking about?

69
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,460
I want to marry you.

70
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,120
for ten years.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
I don't want to wait anymore.

72
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
This is Master's idea.

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
You know it's hard for your father.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,880
I can't refuse my father.

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
but you're still forcing me.

76
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,930
Si-an, you've really changed.

77
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
It’s you, Muwan.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,930
Your eyes are looking at me.

79
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,090
But who are you thinking about?

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,130
What's so good about him

81
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,210
that makes you miss him so much?

82
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Even if he dies, you can't let him go.

83
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
I'm not.

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Then prove it to everyone.

85
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,620
I don't want to lose you again.

87
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,720
Don't be angry.

88
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,500
I won't force you anymore.

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,690
As long as you're happy,

90
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
I'll do anything.

91
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,400
I promise you.

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,440
Everyone.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,800
Today is a big day.

94
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
My daughter, Mu Wan,

95
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,159
and my disciple Si-an

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
with my disciple Si-an.

97
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,720
and share a good story.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,760
Thank you for coming.

99
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
as a witness.

100
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,640
Congratulations.

101
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,320
Bow to heaven and earth.

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Wait.

103
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Who dares to make a scene here?

104
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,080
Stop!

105
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,880
May I ask

106
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,920
why did you break into my Laundry Valley?

107
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,000
I heard that Mr. Fang

108
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,400
has excellent medical skills.

109
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,730
I'm here to see a doctor.

110
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,520
Although the poison is detoxified,

111
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
but her heart pulse is badly damaged.

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,600
It's hard

113
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
to live.

114
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,080
I made a huge mistake.

115
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,160
I deserve to die.

116
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
But my mother was killed.

117
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,640
I didn't take revenge.

118
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
I dare not die.

119
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,880
Please grant my wish.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Young man.

121
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,800
Today is my daughter and son-in-law's wedding day.

122
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,560
You barged in

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,240
and ruin the mood of the guests.

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,370
How inappropriate!

125
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,800
Xie Ci Yuan.

126
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
You have no right

127
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
to interfere with her life anymore.

128
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
The only thing I have to do now

129
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
is to live.

130
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Find Xie Cizhou and end this grudge.

131
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
The rest

132
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
are not important.

133
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
I was reckless.

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
Please forgive me.

135
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,320
Fine.

136
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,500
How about this?

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,160
After my daughter and son-in-law worship the heaven and earth,

138
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,280
I will think about it.

139
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,600
After all,

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,840
I can do a good deed.

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Bow to heaven and earth.

142
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,920
Second bow to your parents.

143
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Bow to each other.

144
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,760
Thank you.

145
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,360
Xie Ciyuan.

146
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,960
Xie Ciyuan, wake up!

147
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
I haven't forgiven you yet.

148
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
You can't die.

149
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
Your life is mine. Wake up.

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
The young master called him Xie Ciyuan.

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,720
Xuan Ping, Xie Ciyuan.

152
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
Isn't he dead?

153
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
He was even exposed to the public.

154
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,760
for seven days and nights.

155
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,920
Besides,

156
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
he has nothing to do with

157
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,640
with us?

158
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,560
Judging from your sad look,

159
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
they seem...

160
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,080
Father.

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,520
Save him.

162
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
Don't be silly.

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,480
I beg you.

164
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,160
I beg you, Father.

165
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
Save him.

166
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,080
If you want him to live,

167
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
let go of him.
