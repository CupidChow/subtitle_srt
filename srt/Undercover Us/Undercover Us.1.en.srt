1
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,650
In the first year of Tianqi,

2
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,120
The Viceroy Xie resigned and seized the throne.

3
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,450
The tyranny is in power.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,940
The people are suffering.

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,760
At that time, a gang started

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,820
Nameless Pavilion

7
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,760
kills treacherous officials.

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,120
and was treated as a thorn in the court.

9
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,039
The bloodshed in the dark night

10
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,600
begins now.

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Master.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
These new recruits

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,900
have grown up quickly.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,039
among them

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
among them.

16
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
Find someone smart

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,090
to Prince Xuanping's mansion.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Didn't you say

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,720
the nameless Pavilion and the court should stay out of each other's business?

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,050
Isn't it inappropriate

21
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,880
isn't it inappropriate?

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,640
Are you questioning my order?

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I dare not.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll do it right away.

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,960
How about this female killer

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
What do you think?

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Are you...

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,840
Si Yao?

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
But she hasn't been to Nameless Pavilion for long.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm afraid she can't take the responsibility.

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,560
Because she has a new face,

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
That's why it's easier.

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,720
But...

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,600
since I saved you,

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,680
since I saved you

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,079
for only five years.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
How do you know

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
She can't do it.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,840
Yes.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,280
It's all up to you.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,120
Sure.

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
How can I

43
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
be buried here?

44
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,640
Come with me.

45
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,980
Where are we going?

46
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,960
To get married.

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
I've arranged a new identity for you.

48
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
From now on,

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,930
you are the new courtesan of Qifeng Pavilion.

50
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,090
You must try your best to get close to Prince Xuanping

51
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,680
to gain his trust.

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Xie Ciyuan is just a playboy.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
What's the use of getting close to him?

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
You know nothing.

55
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,520
He’s Xie Cizhou’s favorite brother.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
In time,

57
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
he will be

58
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
in our hands.

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
You want to

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
kill Xie Cizhou

61
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,650
and help Prince Xuanping become a puppet.

62
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,720
If there is such a chance,

63
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
it would be best.

64
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,720
I understand.

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,000
Summon Duke Ping.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
Yuan.

67
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
I asked you to pick a wife.

68
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
What do you mean?

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
I fell in love with Si Yao at first sight.

70
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,040
and decided to marry her.

71
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240
but I know how much you love me.

72
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,040
So I dare to ask you

73
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,040
to take you and Si Yao in.

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
This...

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Father.

76
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,240
Master Rong is wise.

77
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
You can't do this.

78
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,120
Let's not talk about His Highness's behavior

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,320
and has been criticized.

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,240
We are all from a noble family.

81
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,440
How can a noble lady

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
to serve a prostitute?

83
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,720
If you tell anyone,

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm afraid people will laugh at me.

85
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
and humiliate your dignity.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Since you know I'm a wild man,

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
and look down on me,

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
Why did I go here for nothing and get angry?

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Besides,

90
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,560
my sister is the most powerful in the world.

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,890
Who doesn't fear death?

92
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
How dare you!

93
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,920
You...

94
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Forget it.

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,320
Leave us.

96
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,360
Kneel!

97
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,560
It's all my fault.

98
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,960
Please don't take it out on His Highness.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,730
You have no right to speak here.

100
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,480
Xie Ciyuan.

101
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,380
Do you admit your mistake?

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,080
Yes.

103
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,240
but I can’t help myself.

104
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,280
Although Si Yao is from a noble family,

105
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,920
but she knows my heart.

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,960
I'm willing to be with her forever.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,680
Please help me.

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Nonsense!

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
How can a prostitute marry into our family?

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,880
I beg you to grant me a marriage.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,520
In this way, Si Yao is no longer a humble person.

112
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
If you attend the wedding personally,

113
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
With you in charge,

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,850
who dares to talk nonsense?

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
You are my only brother.

116
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
I won't kill you.

117
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,680
But you're arrogant because you're favored.

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,320
and challenged me again and again.

119
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,280
Do you really think

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,480
I dare not kill you?

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,600
I deserve to die.

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm at your disposal.

123
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,039
Please spare His Highness.

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,440
I

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,480
want to work with Si Yao.

126
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,919
Please help me.

127
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,440
Take your woman

128
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,970
and go back to your mansion.

129
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,440
and reflect on your mistakes.

130
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Without my order,

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
no one is allowed to step out of the mansion.

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,760
Sister.

133
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,000
You don't understand

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
what I said?

135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,920
Yes.

136
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
Bride and groom,

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Bow to heaven and earth.

138
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
and get married.

139
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
May the love last forever.

140
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,840
Second bow to your parents.

141
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,240
Parents and brothers.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,080
May heaven be eternal.

143
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,240
Bow to each other.

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,920
May the phoenix live in harmony.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,840
May you be blessed forever.

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,560
The ceremony is completed.

147
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,160
Get into the bridal chamber.

148
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,800
It smells nice.

149
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
is quite unique.

150
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,500
It's just a fragrance from ordinary people.

151
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

152
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,920
You are so romantic.

153
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,320
how could I dislike it?

154
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,400
The smell of the rouge

155
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,160
is a little sweeter

156
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,040
than just now.
