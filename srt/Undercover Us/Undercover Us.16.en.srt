1
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,600
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
Sure.

3
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,160
Great.

4
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,800
The mysterious master of Nobody Pavilion, Wufeng.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,880
has been under my nose for so many years.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,330
Calm down, Master Rong.

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,289
If these information are true,

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,240
then...

9
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Prince Xuanping's wild ambition

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
is obvious.

11
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,080
He secretly manipulated the nameless Pavilion

12
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,810
and openly oppose Master Rong.

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,400
is a conspiracy.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,680
His purpose is clear.

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,680
Qinglin.

16
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,770
This is Xie Ci Yuan. Let's go. Let's go.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm afraid we can't keep him alive.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,780
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,560
Your Highness.

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
She's back. She's here. She's here.

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,700
Where is the queen?

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,360
She's gone.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
In the future,

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,010
I won't do it again. I won't do it again.

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,420
Your Highness.

26
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,360
How have you been?

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
His Highness has just recovered.

28
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
The mansion hasn't opened yet.

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,880
Guard Qinglin, what do you mean?

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,200
Madam Jin is seriously ill.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
The City Governor summoned Prince Xuan Ping to visit her.

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,040
Even if he wants my lord to visit the City Governor,

33
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
there's no need to make such a scene.

34
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,200
His Highness is seriously ill.

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,160
We were also ordered to escort him.

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,700
Your Highness.

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
Are you okay?

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
Tell Liu Ruyue

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
to take everyone out of Pingcheng with you.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,730
What about you, Your Highness?

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,880
This is an order.

42
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
Just do it.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,640
Guard Qinglin, please lead the way.

44
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Wang.

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
Wang,

46
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Have you recovered?

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,320
As you can see,

48
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,160
she just got out of bed.

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm just worried about my mother.

50
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
so I hurried here.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
You are a lucky man.

52
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,920
Even smallpox can heal.

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
and you'll live a long life in the future.

54
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,370
Thank you for your concern.

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm worried about Mother.

56
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,400
Can I visit Jinchen Garden now?

57
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,159
Visit?

58
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
You are so filial.

59
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
But...

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,159
What about me?

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,720
for so many years.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
It must be hard for you.

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Wufeng.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
What's there to argue about? I'm here.

65
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
Looks like

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,160
you want me to die here today.

67
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Wang Lu,

68
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,040
I don't want you to die.

69
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,920
But why do you always go against me?

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
and make things difficult for you?

71
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,050
You always say Royal Father is hypocritical.

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,960
But look at you now.

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
are no different from him.

74
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,159
Who are you to blame me?

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
In this world,

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,280
you are the least qualified to blame me.

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Fine.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,960
Today, let me see

79
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,120
how capable my brother is.

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,960
I didn't expect

81
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,520
I've been looking for the master of Nameless Pavilion for so many years.

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
is my blood brother.

83
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
You're also a descendant of the Xie family.

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,159
Are you going to destroy Yunzhou yourself?

85
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,560
I was wrong.

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,280
I've always been targeting you.

87
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
If you have Yunzhou,

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,930
will destroy the Xie family's century-old foundation.

89
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Then your plan has failed.

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll kill you today.

91
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,800
Yunzhou...

92
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,040
[is still my world.]

93
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Your world?

94
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,320
You did everything to control power.

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
to control power.

96
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,760
and corrupt officials

97
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
and caused people to suffer.

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,890
How do you deserve the position of City Governor?

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,080
I got this position by myself.

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Why don't I deserve it?

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
If I don't deserve you,

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,680
are you worthy of

103
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
deserve me?

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
You'll know

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
Just give it a try.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
How is that possible?

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,610
How could I get hurt?

108
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
You can untie the poison.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
So what if you can?

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,130
can it change anything?

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,400
You will die today.

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,640
is a dead end.

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,880
Let's see

114
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
if I can break this trap.

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,680
Uncle Wang is so confident.

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,920
disregarding Lady Jin's life?

117
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,640
Ciyuan.

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,560
Let my mother go.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm at your disposal.

120
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
Okay.

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,370
Then cut off your arm immediately.

122
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,280
Ciyuan.

123
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,600
No!

124
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,440
Ciyuan, no!

125
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,559
Mother.

126
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,480
Mother.

127
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
If Mother dies,

128
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
my son

129
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,440
has no weakness.

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,920
and no longer be controlled by others.

131
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Mother.

132
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Mother!

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
Kill him! Kill him!

134
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Why?

135
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Something is going to happen.

136
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,370
You haven't recovered yet.

137
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
Why did you come to the back mountain again?

138
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,320
What if you catch a cold?

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
I'm not a porcelain doll.

140
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm not that weak.

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Besides,

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
my herbs

143
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,760
I've been out of the valley for so long.

144
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,680
I don't know how long it is.

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,380
I'm going to take a look later.

146
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,560
Don't worry.

147
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm here.

148
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,960
They all look good.

149
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
waiting for you to come back.

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm waiting for you too.

151
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,040
The light yellow body is soft.

153
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,010
The love is far away but the fragrance remains

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
In the next autumn,

155
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,400
in the fragrance of osmanthus flowers,

156
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
in this place.

157
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,120
If you like it,

158
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,320
I will plant the osmanthus tree

159
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,000
the osmanthus tree for you.

160
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,880
What's wrong?

161
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Nothing.

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm thinking

163
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,800
why don't we plant some osmanthus trees?

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Osmanthus?

165
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes.

166
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,760
When autumn comes,

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
the garden is filled with fragrance.

168
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
is also good.

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
In the past,

170
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
you would choose to plant

171
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
rare rare rare rare rare rare herbs.

172
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
Now,

173
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
like these ordinary plants.

174
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,450
Osmanthus are not some rare flowers and foreign plants,

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,520
they can make cakes and make tea.

176
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,800
and practical.

177
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,720
Report!

178
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,890
An urgent message from Pingcheng.

179
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,960
What?

180
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,490
Is there anything else you want to tell me behind my back?

181
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Prince Xuanping and his son tried to kill His Majesty.

182
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
and was besieged by the Imperial Guards.

183
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,000
Kill him! Kill him!
