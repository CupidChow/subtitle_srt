1
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,200
You're hurt. You're hurt.

2
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,440
You're injured. You're injured. You're injured.

3
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,120
You're injured. You're injured. You're injured. You're injured. You're injured. You're injured.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,920
It's just a minor injury. It's just a minor injury.

5
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,680
It's just a minor injury.

6
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,080
But I'm hurt and despised.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,120
It's really disappointing.

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,960
Your Highness, if you're disappointed, you can take a look. I'll take a look at it.

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
Have more hot springs.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,680
Nuannuan.

11
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,600
You've been a playboy for years.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
He doesn't look like a playboy.

13
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,920
You've been taking off your clothes in the water

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,880
in the water.

15
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
You've wronged me.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,040
This hot spring is special.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,079
Other members are injured.

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
I come to borrow them from time to time.

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,320
But bathing with a beauty

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,280
I've never seen such a thing.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,120
Then...

22
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,079
He's here. He's here.

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,450
She's here. She's here.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,800
Your Highness.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,200
Is this how you repay your savior?

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
That's how I treat swindlers.

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,730
Speaking of deceiving,

28
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,760
you and I are the same.

29
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,610
Then we have nothing to say.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Are you not even pretending now?

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
I still like

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
gentle and decent you.

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,520
What a pity.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
I'm afraid

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
in the future.

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
Your Royal Highness is noble.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm a liar.

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,560
I don't deserve to sleep with you.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,720
You'd better find a place to sleep tonight.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,280
Don't go back to your room.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,880
How bold.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,120
than I thought.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,400
Madam.

44
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,820
Your Highness.

45
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,320
She's so disrespectful to you.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,980
why are you still coaxing her?

47
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,120
Because she has the secret of antidote.

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Si Yao is tough.

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,010
He doesn’t take the advantage.

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
If we force it,

51
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm afraid I won't get anything.

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
So now,

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
I can only coax him.

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,520
That's too unfair.

55
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Compared to living,

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
is nothing.

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
Your Highness.

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,159
His Highness sent these here.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,770
Throw them away.

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
What a pity.

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,200
These

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,360
were carefully selected by me.

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Is there anything you like?

64
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,720
Are you still angry?

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm afraid His Highness is annoyed now.

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
my unreasonable act.

67
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
I thought

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
why didn't you

69
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,760
send a gentle and obedient man?

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
You think too much.

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Since I married you,

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
you're the only one I'm sure of.

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,159
There's no one else.

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,600
Princess Consort,

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,880
For the sake of my sincere apology,

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
don't be mad at me.

77
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,680
Don't forget

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,600
we are going to travel together.

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
Can you tell me

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,080
why did you help the nameless Pavilion

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,280
fight against your sister?

82
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,840
Why did you stop me

83
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,160
when I took action?

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,720
The two conflicts

85
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,200
the two conflicts?

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
There is only one answer

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,760
only one answer.

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Because...

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
I want to live.

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,160
Okay.

91
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,520
Mother.

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,900
The informant said

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
Uncle Wang and that woman

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,520
had a quarrel.

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
He's been sleeping apart for the past few days.

96
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
But Uncle Wang is very attentive.

97
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,360
He tries to make her happy every day.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
Chuan,

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,840
His relationship with the new princess

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
What do you think?

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,480
Mother.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,360
I guess

103
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,120
that woman does have feelings for Uncle Wang.

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Uncle Wang seems to be sincere to her.

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
Maybe

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,200
she can become a new chip

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
other than Madam Jin.

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,440
I didn't expect you to be so young.

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,650
You can't understand the love between men and women.

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm stupid.

111
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Please enlighten me.

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,360
Your uncle calls himself a playboy.

113
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,480
When did you see him so infatuated with a woman?

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
He acted too seriously

115
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,120
and too anxious.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,040
He said he loves Si Yao.

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,760
He even contradicted me and wanted to marry her.

118
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,080
But after thinking about it,

119
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,780
the consequences of infuriating me.

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
how could he not know?

121
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,520
I didn't kill him,

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
doesn’t mean I won’t kill Si Yao.

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,160
If a man really loves a woman,

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,120
how could he let her

125
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,880
in danger?

126
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,080
So how much is his love

127
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
is true?

128
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,000
We need to verify it.

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Mother is wise.

130
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't catch up with you.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,160
It's okay.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
I'll teach you. I'll teach you. I'll teach you. I'll teach you.

133
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,560
My son...

134
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
will be the next master of Yunzhou.

135
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,919
But the most important thing now...

136
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,240
is to let Qinglin take good care of Prince Xuanping's Mansion.

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,640
and find clues about the assassin that day.

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,640
I will get rid of

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,440
of Nameless Pavilion.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,920
Lady Kam!

141
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,440
Ten years of devotion.

142
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,880
Eating vegetarian and praying Buddha.

143
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,040
I really admire you.

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,640
Your son should have visited you a few days ago.

145
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,120
But he didn't come.

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,600
Don't you want to know why?

147
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
As long as my Xie Yuan is safe,

148
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,080
it doesn't matter

149
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,440
doesn't matter.

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,040
He is my only brother.

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,160
Of course I want him to be safe.

152
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,760
So,

153
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,400
he got married a few days ago.

154
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
I attended the wedding myself.

155
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
Don't you want to know

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
which daughter he chose in the end?

157
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,040
He has his own choice.

158
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,760
I don't need to ask.

159
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,520
Yes.

160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,560
He refused the marriage I selected for him.

161
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,840
But he chose

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,800
a courtesan.

163
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,200
If the late king finds out,

164
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,400
if the late King finds out?

165
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Father.

166
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,440
Father.

167
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
The doctor said you coughed blood again today.

168
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
How do you feel now?

169
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,480
I’m here.

170
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
It’s my fault.

171
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,490
I haven't found the prescription to cure you.

172
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
If there is a way,

173
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,960
I can be healthy.

174
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Would you like to give it a try?

175
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,800
I'll do anything for you.

176
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Okay.

177
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
Good boy.

178
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Have a seat.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,600
You must be tired from running all the way here.

180
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
Here.

181
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,640
Have some tea.

182
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
As for the rest,

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,400
later.

184
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,240
Just because of your filial piety to me,

185
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,760
when I get better,

186
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
I will treat you well.

187
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,320
What did you give me?

188
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,720
Father.

189
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,480
Ouch!

190
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,160
It hurts.

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
This is Gu Gu.

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,940
It can only be used between blood relatives.

193
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,640
You just took the Ziye Poison.

194
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,080
After I take the poison,

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,400
your life

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,480
is connected to me.

197
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,040
You can bear the pain for me.

198
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,840
The pain of flesh and blood.

199
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,880
You...

200
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,560
Why are you doing this to me?

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,400
Isn't this

202
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,480
what you want to see?

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Didn't you just say that you would do anything?

204
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,960
Now is the time for you to be filial to me.

205
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,760
Xie Ciyuan is also your child.

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,800
You are a daughter.

207
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,640
You'll marry someone else sooner or later.

208
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,800
But the resentment is different.

209
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,320
He is the future hope of Yunzhou.

210
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,040
How...

211
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't be afraid. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
