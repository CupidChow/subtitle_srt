1
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
How?

2
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,720
because of this Gu insect?

3
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,160
Yuan.

4
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,640
What happened next?

5
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,080
What happened next?

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
When you heal,

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,759
focus.

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Stop talking.

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,360
That day,

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,320
I went to visit Father as usual.

11
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
Father.

12
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,240
Master praised me today.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Father.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Father! Father!

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,040
Father, wake up!

16
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Father!

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
Father!

18
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,079
Master Rong.

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,520
Thank you.

20
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
How dare you!

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
How dare you

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
to kill your father.

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Father.

24
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
In his eyes,

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,920
only you

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,440
and his son Xie Ciyuan are a family.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
And my daughter

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,200
is just a vessel for his life.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,000
He wants me to die in his place.

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
Why didn’t I kill him?

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,680
The world is mine anyway.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,320
Since the poison can help the host

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,640
for the host,

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,200
Let him try

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,880
if it really works

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
as he said?

37
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,840
What do you want?

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,120
Mother.

39
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,320
I won't let you manipulate me.

40
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,560
The Gu insect has improved my martial arts.

41
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
But similarly,

42
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
once I get hurt,

43
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,680
it's extremely hard to recover.

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,760
So I tried to improve my internal force

45
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
to prevent the pain

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
when the poisonous worm attacks.

47
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,800
My father's most beloved son...

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,159
has become the most notorious

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
in the entire Yunzhou City.

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
She has my mother.

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,720
But I couldn't do anything.

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
I wanted to live.

53
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,880
So,

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
I joined the nameless Pavilion.

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,920
I hope one day

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,760
someone will overthrow her power.

57
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,200
But similarly,

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
in order to live,

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
I have to pretend

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in front of her

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,360
to not be a threat to her.

62
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
That day,

63
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
I went to the City Governor's Residence

64
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
to see my mother.

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
Unfortunately,

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
I failed.

67
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,159
everything will be over.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
I believe

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,320
You have to believe too.

70
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,920
Old Master Rong has never...

71
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,280
that you're the master of Yunzhou.

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,440
The things you took...

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,600
is not justifiable.

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,960
You know that

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,160
better than anyone else.

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,200
and more than anyone else.

77
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Right?

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,920
So what?

79
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,280
Even if I took it,

80
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,160
it's still mine now.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
But your son

82
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,120
is suffering that shouldn't have belonged to him.

83
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,680
They say mother and son are connected.

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
Madam Kam is in pain right now.

85
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
Does it hurt?

86
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
What's wrong?

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,400
Help me.

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
How?

89
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,920
Why can I help you suppress the Gu insects?

90
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,120
If she knows

91
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,440
her blood can suppress the Gu insects,

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
She must be wary of me.

93
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,280
Then everything you did before

94
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
will be in vain.

95
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,400
At least,

96
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,760
it's not the time to tell the truth.

97
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,640
Actually,

98
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,960
because of this.

99
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,559
Isn't this my sachet?

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Not bad.

101
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
There must be

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,559
in this sachet.

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,120
which can let Gu insects rest for a while.

104
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,840
No.

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,679
If it's because of the sachet,

106
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,840
why did you...

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,120
You tricked me.

108
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,640
What are you talking about?

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
I was just in a hurry.

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
How dare you tease me twice?

111
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,160
The queen kissed me on her own.

112
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,760
Shut up!

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,880
I shouldn't have worried about you.

114
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
If you kill the royal family,

115
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,240
will be executed.

116
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
Don't scare me.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm warning you.

118
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't do this again.

119
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
Otherwise...

120
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,240
Otherwise what?

121
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,280
You've been with me for so long.

122
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,000
you still don't know me.

123
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,880
I don't like being threatened,

124
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
but

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,680
I still have a weakness.

126
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
For example now.

127
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,360
You can try beauty.

128
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll do whatever you say.

129
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Xie Ciyuan.

130
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,120
If you dare to tease me again,

131
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
I'll kill you.

132
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,480
What a pity.

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,520
In this world,

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
a loving couple

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,120
one more beautiful widow.

136
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Shameless!

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
We're not a loving couple.

138
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
We're just pretending

139
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
for the mission.

140
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,600
You are the deity

141
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
and all the gods.

142
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,440
the Princess Xuanping who was officially married.

143
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
Who told you it's fake?

144
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,000
Master Lin,

145
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,640
in the sachet,

146
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
there is also a very rare dragon knot grass.

147
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
Dragon knot grass.

148
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,880
Dragon knot grass.

149
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
It's also known as the Sea Stone.

150
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,120
It's said that the Red Dragon Snake will become a dragon after crossing the sea.

151
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,240
Unfortunately,

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,680
I couldn't move forward after I got to Onigashima.

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
If you fail,

154
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
he sprayed stones to vent his anger.

155
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,320
Over a thousand years,

156
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,760
he spitted the rocks into mushrooms.

157
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,200
and added poison to it.

158
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,680
It's extremely poisonous.

159
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
It's poison.

160
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,000
There's something you don't know.

161
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Although the dragon knot grass is extremely poisonous,

162
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,800
but it can become an immune body.

163
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,680
and cultivate 1000 years of primordial energy.

164
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,760
But

165
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,920
only a thousand-year-old dragon knot grass can be taken.

166
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,640
Less than a thousand years.

167
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
The entrance

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
will die.

169
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,640
In her blood,

170
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
in her blood.

171
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
It's even thicker and heavier.

172
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,040
It turns out that it’s dragon knot grass.

173
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,440
No wonder this sachet can only suppress Gu insects for a moment.

174
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Her blood

175
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
can make Gu insects sleep for a long time.

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
Where can we find

177
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
Where can I find it?

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
In my opinion,

179
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
there is a place

180
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,120
there is only a place

181
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,440
is

182
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,240
Laundry Valley.

183
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
You mean where the base is?

184
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
where no one knows where the base is?

185
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,360
Yes.

186
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
There's a rumor that

187
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
Rumour has it that

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,080
can live and die,

189
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,280
and mastered all kinds of poisons.

190
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
It's an amazing place.

191
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,680
Now I can tell

192
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,120
I know it’s not ordinary.

193
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,960
Laundry Valley?

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,400
This is an unexpected gain.

195
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:37,960
