1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,680
There's a helper here.

2
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,680
But you two

3
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,940
won't be able to escape safely today.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,880
Let's go!

5
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,820
Stop chasing them!

6
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,450
Someone must have leaked the news.

7
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
Send the goods out first.

8
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Yes.

9
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,120
They won't come after us.

10
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,900
Why are you helping me?

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Anyway, thank you for tonight.

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,970
May I have your name?

13
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
I will repay you someday.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're from the nameless Pavilion.

15
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,760
If you're from the nameless Pavilion,

16
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,420
why didn't you show your face?

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,079
And why did you stop me

18
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,880
why did you stop me from assassinating Xie Cizhou?

19
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
Why are you silent?

20
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,850
Answer my question.

21
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,580
Your Highness.

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,560
It's you.

23
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,680
How did you recognize me?

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,580
The incense in the room

25
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,060
is my most familiar scent.

26
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
When I see you twice,

27
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,040
you smell like this.

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,530
I can't be mistaken.

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm curious.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
You're poisoned.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,760
You're okay?

32
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
I don't know.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The poison

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,680
on me.

35
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,520
seems to only last for a moment.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,060
But please answer my question first.

37
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,840
Why did the dignified Prince Xuanping

38
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,680
become the assassin of the nameless Pavilion?

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,760
I want to

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,040
about this question.

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,880
What's wrong?

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Help me.

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,560
How?

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,100
What happened?

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,160
We need to ask the acting master.

46
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,520
I didn't know you trusted me so much.

47
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,680
I thought I could

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,140
the elite of the entire Shenwu Guards alone.

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,140
Temporary Master.

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,280
He sent me to help you.

51
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,760
Ciyuan is right.

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,040
The mission tonight is very important.

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,280
I can only send someone I trust there.

54
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
This is the second question

55
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,720
I want to ask you.

56
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,680
Why did Prince Xuanping suddenly become a member of the nameless Pavilion?

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
And you

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,600
about this matter.

59
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,409
Ciyuan has a special identity.

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
I don't want to tell you

61
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
I won't tell you.

62
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,680
So you mean

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,000
I risked my life for the nameless Pavilion

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm still an outsider.

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,280
That's not what I meant.

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Because

67
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Ciyuan is an important member

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
to us.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,240
So his wife

70
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,880
must be one of us.

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,320
This is also the reason

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,040
assigned to you last time.

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,500
What about Xie Cizhou?

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
You don’t know about it.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,640
That’s why you came out to stop me, right?

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,000
My relationship with Xie Cizhou is complicated.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
I can’t touch her for a while.

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,180
But you have to believe

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm on your side.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,480
Otherwise,

81
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,890
I wouldn't risk my life to save you.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,040
You may leave.

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,290
I have something to talk to Ciyuan.

84
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,080
Yes.

85
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
There is a hot spring in the backyard of the mansion.

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,530
Spring is very effective for healing.

87
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
You can have a try.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,280
It'll help your injury.

89
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,760
Okay.

90
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Thank you.

91
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,159
It's my fault.

92
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,370
I didn't investigate the mission.

93
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,720
As usual,

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,000
For today's mission,

95
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,320
we have to send more than five masters

96
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,720
to escape unscathed.

97
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,720
You only sent Si Yao there.

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,680
to kill her.

99
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
Tell me.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
Why?

101
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Ruyue.

102
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,360
I remember I told you

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,680
being emotional is a taboo for a killer.

104
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
I was careless.

105
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
I acted on my own

106
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,480
and almost killed my master.

107
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
I just want to teach her a lesson.

108
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,320
I think

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
you are determined to kill her.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
May I ask

111
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
to ask you something.

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,040
You asked Si Yao to go to Prince Xuanping's Mansion.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,720
And tonight,

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,040
to save her tonight.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,320
to save her.

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,040
Please forgive me.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,920
She is indeed different from me.

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
I understand.

120
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,040
Because she can suppress the Gu insects in my body.

121
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,320
So,

122
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,400
Si Yao must be alive.

123
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,840
It’s my fault.

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,880
I will never do it again.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,240
I want you to remember it carefully.

126
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,280
When you find her,

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,240
what else

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,360
that can prove her identity?

129
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
She has

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,799
in her body,

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,200
there is nothing special.

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
This...

133
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Yes.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,560
Please.

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
I was kidnapped.

136
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Let me go home.

137
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
What a joke.

138
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,760
Once you enter this gold den,

139
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
you belong here.

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,880
I'll die here.

141
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,960
Do you think

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
You can get away! No!

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
It's not her.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,280
You're right.

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,080
She's skilled in martial arts.

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,410
She won't put herself in such a situation.

147
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,280
Benefactor,

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
Please save me.

149
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
Do you know

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,480
where the girls

151
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,480
with you?

152
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,160
We were all blindfolded

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
to different places.

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,450
Let's go.

155
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,160
Let me send you somewhere safe.

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,960
Thank you, benefactor.

157
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,290
Thank you, benefactor.

158
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
By the way,

159
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
I heard them mention

160
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,020
a woman will send them here tomorrow.

161
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,520
Please save them too.

162
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,080
Okay.

163
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Master.

164
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,800
How is it?

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,520
Any news about Mianwan?

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
No.

167
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,520
But I found that

168
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,640
a woman will be sent to Lu City tomorrow.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
I want to stay here for a while.

170
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
Okay.

171
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,880
Stay in Lu City.

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll take someone

173
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
to the nearby villages.

174
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Master.

175
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,480
We will find Muwan.

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,010
Why are you here?

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,000
I heard that father punished you to stay up late to practice.

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,320
I forbid you to have dinner.

179
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,880
I brought you some snacks.

180
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,640
Eat slowly.

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
It's all yours.

182
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
It's almost dawn.

183
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,040
Go back and rest.

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,640
If Master finds out,

185
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,420
he'll scold you again.

186
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,840
I have to get up to practice anyway.

187
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
How about

188
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,280
Let's watch the sunrise.

189
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
Sure.

190
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I haven't seen the sunrise I owe you.

191
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
I will find you.

192
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,840
This medicine pool...

193
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
is indeed Xie Ciyuan.

194
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,480
He spent a lot of money.

195
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,000
The water is really refreshing.

196
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
Your qi and blood are lively.

197
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,320
How can you be so shameless?

198
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,100
You and I are husband and wife.

199
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Shameless.

200
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
Where should I start?

201
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Besides, last time at Qifeng Pavilion,

202
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,640
in Qifeng Pavilion

203
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,280
I've never seen before?

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
You're injured.

205
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,320
Yes.

206
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
Although it's not a big deal

207
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,680
to save the princess,

208
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
But I'm hurt and despised.

209
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,200
It's really disappointing.

210
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,920
If you're disappointed,

211
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,160
have more hot spring.

212
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,280
Nuannuan.
