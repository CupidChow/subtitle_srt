1
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,400
OK. OK.

2
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,680
Guys,

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,039
I'd like to ask where the horse seller

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
is in Lu City?

5
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,440
You want to buy horses too?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,520
Yes.

7
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,039
Please do me a favor.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,420
Please show me the way.

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,820
I wonder what kind of horse

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,160
what kind of horse do you prefer?

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,400
In my opinion,

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,240
what you need is

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,720
a big horse.

14
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,120
Is it funny?

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,640
Try smiling again.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,479
It's all your nonsense.

17
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,000
My lords,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,039
Please forgive me.

20
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,160
We'll leave now.

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Yes.

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,759
Get out of here

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Baishi Store

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
I heard that the governor of Lucheng

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,560
likes collecting calligraphy and paintings of this antique shop.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,160
His Highness loves painting too.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,520
It would be a pity

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,960
it would be a pity.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
They said they're here to buy horses. They're here to buy horses.

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,520
to buy horses.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,840
But there is no horse market in the local area.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
Besides, they were rude when buying horses.

33
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,800
Their eyes are wild.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,840
He's totally different from other people who love horses.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm afraid...

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,840
Not bad.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,320
I don't think they bought horses.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
but human slaves.

40
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,810
Buying horses is their gossip.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,480
Let's go.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,260
Follow the guard of Lu City

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
and see if we can see

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
in human traffickers.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Who is it?

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
I heard

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,720
Xie Cizhou sent Li Yan to Lu City.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,600
The opera in Lu City

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,320
is getting louder.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
I wonder

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,579
will perform next.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,160
This is good.

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,960
14 years old.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,320
You're young

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,880
and smooth.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,720
I think

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
you like it.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,760
The last batch of goods

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,680
the Noble Lady gave us a big reward.

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
30 taels of gold.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,720
If I can

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,480
make her happy again,

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Maybe

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
it's not a problem

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
to be promoted.

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,680
Bastard!

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
How did you drive?

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Where did this crazy woman come from?

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
How dare you

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,860
How dare you kidnap me?

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Do you want to die?

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't be stubborn.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Heroine.

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
Please spare my life.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,520
I spoke without thinking.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Please forgive me.

77
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,720
If you want money,

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,240
I have some money on me.

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
Just take it.

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,660
If it's not enough,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
I have a gold jade pendant on my waist.

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,460
It's worth some money.

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,839
I don't care about the money.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm here

85
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,959
to ask you a question.

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Heroine,

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,760
I heard that each batch of goods

88
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,320
will leave two youngest and beautiful girls

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
to a big shot.

90
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Who is

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,520
Who is it?

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
Your Excellency.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,760
Don't be surprised.

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,080
I know clearly

95
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,960
with the Li family.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,680
All the human traffickers

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,810
who abducted girls.

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
Now you just need to tell me

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
who this big shot is,

100
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,480
I can make it quick for you.

101
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,960
Who are you?

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,770
Nameless Pavilion.

103
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,160
Nameless Pavilion kills traitors.

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
You are not the first one.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,820
Naturally, you won't be the last one.

106
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,080
to kidnap an innocent girl.

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
to kill innocent girls.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,400
But if you tell me

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,460
who the big shot is,

110
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
I can make an exception.

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
to make up for your mistake.

112
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
and keep you alive.

113
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,600
What?

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,820
You still expect someone to save you?

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,560
I'm afraid the governor will be disappointed.

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,760
After we parted,

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
I went to the city gate to guard Li Yan's whereabouts.

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,200
The first thing Li Yan did

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,170
went to the governor's office.

120
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
I didn't see this fool.

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
he took his men

122
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,760
to the brothel.

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
Looks like Li Yan came to Lu City

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,320
to kill the abducted girls.

125
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Unfortunately, he was a step late.

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
They were saved

127
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
to Pingcheng.

128
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh no.

129
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,120
What if they hurt those girls

130
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,930
on their way back to Pingcheng?

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't worry.

132
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
I've sent someone

133
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,960
to ensure their safety.

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,930
That's good.

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,890
Unfortunately,

136
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
we still haven't found Cui.

137
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,200
That's easy.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
I'll only give you one chance.

139
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
Whether you tell me or not,

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
is up to the governor.

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,920
I really don't know anything.

142
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,320
Tell me.

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,159
Don't kill me.

144
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,840
I said,

145
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,080
Minister promised me

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,130
he abducted girls from Pingcheng to Lucheng.

147
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,240
to entertain the nobles in Yunzhou

148
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,880
to win people's hearts.

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
But somehow,

150
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,560
the incident in Pingcheng

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,000
about what happened in Pingcheng.

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
to stop the carriage out of the city.

153
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
The Li family and his son were vigilant.

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,159
so they asked me to look for them in Lu City.

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
No wonder.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
the girls from Lu City

157
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
are also missing one after another.

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
You haven't answered me.

159
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,240
Where were those girls

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
were sent to?

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
By the order of the Grand Preceptor,

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,600
to leave

163
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,240
the most talented girls.

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,080
To...

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,280
To Master Rong.

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
Everyone knows that you're the head of the noodles.

167
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,770
What does she want these girls for?

168
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,040
I really don't know.

169
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,520
Please don't kill me.

170
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,280
I don't want to die.

171
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,640
I really don’t want to die.

172
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,360
You have betrayed Xie Cizhou.

173
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
If it falls into her hands,

174
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,760
it would be worse than death.

175
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,920
Why don't

176
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
let me give you a ride.

177
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,120
Thank you.

178
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,080
Ci Yuan has been manipulated by you for so many years.

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,120
and suffered so much for you.

180
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,880
Now,

181
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,240
trapped him alive in this mansion.

182
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Thank you.

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
You are inhuman!

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
Didn't you say

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
everyone knows my character.

186
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
I even killed my biological father.

187
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Besides,

188
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,320
my half-brother

189
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
Lady Kam!

190
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't be too sad.

191
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,120
I was joking just now.

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
My brother has an infectious disease.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,330
Seal the mansion is a temporary solution.

194
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
Besides,

195
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
he is my other life.

196
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,960
How can I watch him die?

197
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
I've sent my order.

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,480
to send medicine every seven days.

199
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,040
to confirm my brother's safety.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
But

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,760
if my brother can't make it,

202
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,840
and let Madam Jin send the black-haired man away,

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,960
I will

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
will arrange a grand funeral for him.

205
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,400
I won’t disgrace the Xie family.

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,560
Thank you.

207
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
You...

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,960
When I fell down and hurt my knees,

209
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,040
That's how you look at me.

210
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,920
In this world,

211
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,640
is really ironic.

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Amitabha. Amitabha.

213
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,000
Amitabha. Amitabha.

214
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,580
What are you thinking?

215
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,420
Are you worried about Cui?

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
I think Cui's parents

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
are so anxious about this.

218
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,360
They must love her very much.

219
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
That feeling...

220
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,560
I envy them.

221
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
I want to help them reunite.

222
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,400
But now,

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,340
there's another thing that worries me more.

224
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,340
Do you know a secret technique

225
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,760
called Hua Rong killing?

226
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Huarong killing?

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,440
Good.

228
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,920
It's a very strange technique.

229
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
Take a virgin under 16.

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
to make elixirs with blood.

231
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Rumour has it that

232
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,240
can keep people forever.

233
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
If Cui and those girls

234
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,880
were really given to Xie Cizhou,

235
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,720
will they...

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why would she do such a stupid thing?

237
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
The situation in Yunzhou is turbulent.

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,680
If a girl disappearance case occurs at this time,

239
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
it will only make her more disloyal.

240
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,880
No.

241
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,600
I was careless.

242
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,250
She doesn't care about the people.

243
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,400
You are right.

244
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
Since Li Yan

245
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,000
to kill Li Yan in Lu City,

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,760
That means

247
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
she must know about this.

248
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,000
Xie Cizhou is arrogant

249
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
and wants to be happy.

250
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
power and status.

251
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,320
and the most beautiful face.

252
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
and she must get it.

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,200
That's why

254
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,600
the reason she wanted the Girl's Blood to cultivate alchemy.

255
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,480
The governor of Lu City is dead.

256
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
This place will surely cause a stir.

257
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,880
Since we have got the clue we want,

258
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,440
why don’t we go back to Pingcheng

259
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,960
and find out the truth

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,480
lest any young girls get hurt again.

261
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,610
Where's the sachet?

262
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,240
Are you okay?

263
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

264
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm fine.

265
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,680
Wait for me here.

266
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,120
I'll go to the workshop to find a carriage.

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
We’ll go back to Pingcheng tonight.

268
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
If Xie Cizhou

269
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,080
is really crazy enough to cultivate alchemy with the blood of a young girl,

270
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,010
Then this person

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,920
is more dangerous

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,000
and inhumane.

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,440
We must get Mother out of the City Governor's Residence as soon as possible.
