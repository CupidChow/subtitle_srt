1
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,459
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

2
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,170
An urgent message from Pingcheng.

3
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,280
What?

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,690
Is there anything else you want to tell me behind my back?

5
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,039
Prince Xuanping and his son tried to kill His Majesty.

6
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,120
and was besieged by the Imperial Guards.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,180
Kill him! Kill him!

8
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,840
I'll kill you today. I'll kill you.

9
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,479
I'll kill you!

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,320
Go! Go! Go!

11
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
Xie Ci Yuan.

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
My good brother.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,040
This is what happens when you go against me.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Xie Ci Yuan.

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Xie Ci.

16
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
Sorry.

17
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
I didn't mean it.

18
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,440
Xie Ci Yuan.

19
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
Xie Ciyuan is dead.

20
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Master said you were too worried

21
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,840
and gave you a prescription to calm your nerves.

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Drink it while it's hot.

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
I added some licorice.

24
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,290
It's not bitter.

25
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,850
I don't mean anything else.

26
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
I just want to know

27
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
Xie Ciyuan.

28
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,800
Is he dead or not?

29
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Do you want him dead or alive?

30
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,400
He lied to me.

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,200
I want him to die

32
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
and die a miserable death.

33
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,300
Congratulations.

34
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,089
You got what you wanted.

35
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Muwan.

36
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
I don’t know what happened

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,140
between you and Xie Xirui.

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
But it was just a dream.

39
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,720
Now,

40
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,320
It's time to go back to your life.

41
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
Look carefully.

42
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,600
Look at your eyes.

43
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,040
The one beside you is me.

44
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm the one

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,640
is me.

46
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,060
You've been too tired these days.

47
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
Take a rest.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
When you recover,

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,130
I'll travel around with you

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,620
and see the landscape you want to see.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,180
As for the other unimportant things,

52
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,420
we should stop thinking about it.

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,170
Leave everything to me and Master.

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay?

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
According to the news,

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,280
Xie Ciyuan was killed

57
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
Wufeng’s identity was exposed.

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,200
Is this

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,330
related to the Laundry Valley?

60
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,300
It doesn't matter.

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
It's important.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Yes.

63
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,130
It's true that he sold the nameless Pavilion.

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
So what?

65
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,480
He made you miserable.

66
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
We're just repaying him.

67
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,200
Do you have any ways

68
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,280
to kill him.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,680
I won't interfere.

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
But why

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480
betray him

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,840
from the nameless Pavilion.

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,900
In the end, I became a traitor of the nameless Pavilion.

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
How can I

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,360
hate him from the bottom of my heart?

76
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
If you don't hate him,

77
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
then forget him completely.

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,720
That's better.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,730
I want the osmanthus seedling.

80
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
Send it here as soon as possible.

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Okay.

82
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,780
I'll send someone to do it.

83
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
Take him back to the City Governor's Residence.

84
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
If you resist,

85
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,840
execute them on the spot.

86
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,360
Yes.

87
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,180
Your Highness.

88
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,039
Didn't I ask you to pass a message to Liu Ruyue

89
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
to evacuate.

90
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,140
Why are there so many people in Qifeng Pavilion?

91
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
Forgive me, Your Highness.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,960
I did tell Master Lin.

93
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
but he was worried about His Highness.

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
and refuses to leave.

95
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,520
So...

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,080
But the other strongholds have been evacuated.

97
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,360
Only here and Jishi Clinic

98
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,880
and some people are waiting for them.

99
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,940
It's not a big loss.

100
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
Leave a group of people and watch out for the City Governor's mansion.

101
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,440
If anyone escapes,

102
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,720
we'll help them.

103
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,440
If you can't escape,

104
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,020
remember to collect the body.

105
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,680
Master Lin just detoxified the Gu poison.

106
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,280
His heart pulse is unstable.

107
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,720
Plus, he's got new injuries

108
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
and got injured.

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
The injury

110
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
because of your strong inner power.

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Otherwise, he would have died.

112
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,360
But if we don't deal with it in time,

113
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,960
you might die.

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,020
Please prescribe the prescription.

115
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,680
Is there any difficulty?

116
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,720
If you want to rebuild your heart,

117
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,520
we need to go to the Laundry Valley.

118
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
There are all kinds of rare herbs in the Laundry Valley.

119
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,650
There are also skilled hidden experts

120
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,560
in order to stay healthy.

121
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,580
Come to think of it,

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,900
she should have returned to the Laundry Valley.

123
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,420
Your Highness.

124
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,780
I heard that the news leak from Nameless Pavilion is...

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
It can't be her.

126
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,520
She said

127
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,760
she wouldn't let me die so easily.

128
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
But the evidence is solid.

129
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
The one who informed Xie Cizhou was Laundry Valley.

130
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
If it’s not revenge, then what?

131
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,960
Even if it's her,

132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,280
I have nothing to say.

133
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,880
I owe her this.

134
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Don't worry.

135
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,120
I'll prescribe some medicine for you

136
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,280
to stabilize your injury.

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,040
We can make another plan.

138
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you, Doctor Qin.

139
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,220
Your Highness.

140
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,320
The whole city is currently under siege. We can't escape. Let's go.

141
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,450
It’s hard to escape.

142
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,120
Thank you for finding a fake body to impersonate you.

143
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
and hung it on the city gate to the public.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,520
I don't know why.

145
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,960
to warn others.

146
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,640
After this move,

147
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
the ministers

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
who opposed her

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,260
dare not say anything.

150
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,760
They're afraid of setting themselves on fire.

151
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,820
After all, even brothers and compatriots can kill him.

152
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,480
There are more problems in the world.

153
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
Since Wufeng died,

154
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,080
Nobody Pavilion will be in chaos without a leader.

155
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,040
Then she can seize the chance

156
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,800
and catch them all.

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
In your opinion,

158
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
what should we do?

159
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,160
Don't move.

160
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,920
Wait for a chance to leave the city.
