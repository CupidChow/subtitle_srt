1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Look at the chest.

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,450
The venomous insect has started to absorb the heart meridians.

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,370
If we don’t find a way to cure it,

4
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,320
I’m afraid

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,720
Let's go. Let's go.

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,560
It backfired.

7
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
How could it backfire?

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Before this,

9
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,800
He's here.

10
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,160
We can start the antidote.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,440
But the blood in the heart

12
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,090
If anything goes wrong,

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,320
you will die.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,120
for her life.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,479
Her life

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,560
was picked up by me at the foot of Dragon Bae Mountain.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,620
It belongs to the nameless Pavilion.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
I know you are invincible.

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,039
So I used a golden needle to seal the acupoints.

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
Your struggle now

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,640
is in vain.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,410
What are you doing? What are you doing?

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Do you think

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,360
why he tried so hard to approach you?

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
and why

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
choose you to be Princess Xuanping?

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,280
Is it because

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
because he likes you?

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,200
Idiot.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,200
It's because of your blood.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
can cure his poison.

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,360
All this

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
is a trap we set for you.

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,180
You don't know yet, do you?

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,280
The man in front of you

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,400
is the real owner of the nameless Pavilion.

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,360
Wufeng.

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,520
Xie Ciyuan.

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,090
If Master Lin wants to live,

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
you must die.

41
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,560
The length of cufflinks is different.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,240
Dad.

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
Take it off.

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,720
How can you wear this?

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
This is nice.

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,240
This is the first time my daughter made clothes for me.

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm not going to change anything.

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
Si-an, here.

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,140
Have an orange.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
You bought fruits from the mountain again?

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,960
You want me to try sour and sweet for you?

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,880
Try it now.

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,880
How is it?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,660
Is it sweet?

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,159
Winter

56
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
It's really winter

57
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,800
It's not easy to grow one.

58
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,520
I must take it back today.

59
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,920
So

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,880
I am Fang Muwan.

61
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,400
Master.

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,720
Our men have found out

63
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,680
the man beside Mu Wan

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,540
is Prince Xuanping’s Xie Ciyuan.

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
But strangely,

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,680
According to the news from Pingcheng,

67
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,940
Xie Ciyuan was imprisoned in the mansion

68
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,530
Xie Cizhou imprisoned him in the mansion.

69
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,159
Why is he in Lu City?

70
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Your Highness.

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
How could Mianwan

72
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,520
with the court?

73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,920
There's something more fishy.

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
I sent someone to find out

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,240
where Mu Wan went missing.

76
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,280
That place has something to do with the nameless Pavilion?

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,400
You mean

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,330
during Mianwan’s disappearance,

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,240
during her disappearance.

80
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,010
It's very possible.

81
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,100
After all, she can't remember anything.

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
It’s strange.

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Since Mianwan has become a killer,

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,640
how can she get involved with the mansion?

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm afraid her experience is not that simple.

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,320
The most important thing now

87
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,380
is to take her back to Laundry Valley.

88
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
Whether it's Prince Xuanping's Mansion

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
or the nameless Pavilion,

90
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,720
are very dangerous to her.

91
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Master.

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,440
Bad news.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,970
Young Master is in trouble.

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
How dare you hurt her!

95
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,080
Take her blood.

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,080
and cure this man with heart blood.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
Then he must die today.

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,320
Stop!

99
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
Do you

100
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,180
the life of this woman?

101
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Let her go.

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
Take Master Lin away.

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,120
You've suffered.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I will seek justice for you.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
How is

106
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
How is it?

107
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,680
That bastard.

108
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,120
How dare he take Mianwan’s blood?

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,240
I won’t let it go.

110
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,260
I saw it with my own eyes today.

111
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,530
Xie Ciyuan was poisoned by the poison.

112
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
with Mu Wan’s blood.

113
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Mianwan.

114
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,760
has been taking the dragon formula since childhood.

115
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,620
Her blood can cure all kinds of Gu.

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,960
Xie must have

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,520
must have deceived her

118
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,600
and deceived her.

119
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,960
and made her the queen.

120
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Her purpose

121
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,160
is to

122
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,960
the valuable blood

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,560
the valuable blood.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,320
This guy

125
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,520
He's so cunning.

126
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,490
How despicable.

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,940
One more thing.

128
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,679
Yesterday, I heard the lady from the nameless Pavilion

129
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,740
called him master.

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,159
You mean...

131
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,799
Xie Ciyuan?

132
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,680
He is the master of Nameless Pavilion. He is

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,480
Wufeng.

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,840
No wonder the information we found before

135
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,720
Mianwan is the assassin of Nameless Pavilion,

136
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,240
she went in and out with Prince Xuanping.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,360
If Prince Xuanping is Wufeng,

138
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
everything will make sense.

139
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,080
If Xie Cizhou knows

140
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,760
her useless brother

141
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,440
is so scheming.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,800
I wonder how she will feel.

143
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
I will make sure

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
know

145
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
of this brother.

146
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,360
How about this?

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
You

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,340
keep an eye on Mianwan.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,680
I’ll make the medicine.

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,080
I’m in the next room.

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,010
If Mianwan has any problem,

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,900
report to me immediately.

153
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,850
Understood.

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm glad you're fine.

155
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,410
Don't worry.

156
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
Come back to me.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,260
I won't let you get hurt again.

158
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
Are you really going to leave with him?

159
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,120
Why can't I leave?

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,020
Is it because your poison hasn't been cured yet?

161
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,640
What?

162
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,200
I was right.

163
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Let me explain.

164
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,840
Explain what?

165
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
You approached me not to detoxify the poison.

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,200
You said you wanted me to stay

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,640
because you really love me.

168
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,400
If I say yes...

169
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop lying.

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,560
If one day,

171
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,050
you want to take my blood

172
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
you want my blood

173
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,200
and my life.

174
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Do you want me to believe

175
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,820
you have your reasons?

176
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Xie Ciyuan.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
We were wrong from the beginning.

178
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
Let me go.

179
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
No way.

180
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,360
Let go!

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,420
Don't touch me.

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,080
You're my wife.

183
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,760
Why can't I touch you?

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Si Yao.

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,800
Don't forget

186
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,280
you are the Princess Xuanping whom I officially married.

187
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Are you crazy?

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
I’m not Si Yao.

189
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,400
I’m Fang Muwan.

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,760
I’m not from Nameless Pavilion.

191
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
I belong to Laundry Valley.

192
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
You are wrong.

193
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,810
You belong to me from beginning to end.

194
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
No!

195
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,920
Let her go!

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Xie Ciyuan.

197
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm going to kill you.
