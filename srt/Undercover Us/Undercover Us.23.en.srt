1
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,920
It's not the right time. It's the right time. It's the right time. It's the right time.

2
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
He said it's not the right time.

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,380
before the time comes?

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,600
How could he be ambushed by Xie Cizhou?

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,520
Where is he now?

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,600
The City Governor's Residence.

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm not sure about the details.

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,039
Will you go with me

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,240
Let's go. Let's go.

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,770
Let's go.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
I told you

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,880
Don’t trust anyone.

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,720
Look at me. Look at me.

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Hi. Hi.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,130
Your Highness! Your Highness!

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,479
He's here! He's here! He's here!

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
He’s here. He’s here.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,520
He came here on behalf of Master Lin.

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,580
and transferred all the guards here.

20
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,000
Ordinary people don't know the location of Laundry Valley.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,530
Being attacked by soldiers

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
which means there is a mole among us.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,699
And the one who betrayed us

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,120
is the woman you've been protecting.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,300
Your Highness.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
This is the second time you put Mu Wan in danger.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,120
Whether she is safe or not,

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
I will

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm going to kill her. I'm going to kill her! I'm going to kill her!

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
Si Yao.

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
Liu Ruyue.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,120
You work for Xie Cizhou?

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,840
So what?

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,960
You'll work for me too.

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,480
I didn't know

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Princess Xuanping's blood

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,760
is so precious.

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,760
It can be used as the guiding of all poisons.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,060
No wonder even the poison can be detoxified.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,320
You didn't let me down.

41
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Does your promise

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,560
still count?

43
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
My blood

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,160
is useless to you.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,500
If you want to cultivate elixirs,

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,440
I know someone.

47
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,920
Who is it?

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,800
It's the one who untied the mother's poison.

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
Where is she?

50
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
Let's make a deal.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,080
with Master Rong?

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
What do you have?

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,000
to make a deal with me?

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,280
That person is the young master of Laundry Valley.

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,880
No one can get close to her.

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,159
Laundry Valley?

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
A few years ago,

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,880
I met him once.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
I heard that his poisons

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
is really amazing.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,900
I secretly sent someone to investigate.

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,280
But...

63
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,680
no one has ever known

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,960
where the entrance is.

65
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,960
I can catch this person for Master Rong.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,400
But can you guarantee

67
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,200
Master Rao won't die?

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,880
You went through so much trouble

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
not for yourself.

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
but for Xie Ciyuan.

71
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,120
For him,

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
for him.

73
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
My good brother.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
What's so charming

75
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
make you fall in love?

76
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,440
Fine.

77
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,920
If this chip you mentioned

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
is so valuable,

79
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
Then...

80
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
I agree.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
Fight the tiger for its skin.

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
you might die.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
I remember you said

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,560
you can do anything for Xie Ciyuan.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,080
I'll grant your wish.

86
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,530
Don't come over.

87
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,820
What are you doing?

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,280
What do you think?

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,880
Actually,

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
you are just like those men.

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
like those men.

92
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880
Really?

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,980
If you're willing,

94
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
I can give you a new life.

95
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,880
Save your energy.

96
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,560
You can live a few more days.

97
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,810
The blood of a thousand-year-old dragon.

98
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,100
is indeed extraordinary.

99
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,970
Master Rong.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
I received news that

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,520
Xie Ci Yuan is gathering the former members of Nameless Pavilion.

102
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,180
You overestimated yourself.

103
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,559
Xie Ciyuan’s heart vein is damaged.

104
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,440
It's the end of the force.

105
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,580
The nameless Pavilion was greatly damaged.

106
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,280
How can he fight alone?

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
Since they want to die,

108
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll help them.

109
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,690
Qinglin.

110
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
Send a letter to Xie Ciyuan.

111
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Tell him that at noon tomorrow,

112
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
at noon tomorrow

113
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,760
to console the late castellan's spirit.

114
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Yes.

115
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
My good brother.

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
It's time

117
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,400
should be put to an end.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,160
My good brother.

119
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,160
You really have a bunch of loyal dogs.

120
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
I didn’t expect

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Commander Lu would help you.

122
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,960
I’m not helping him.

123
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
but to help

124
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,180
the people under the Emperor's control.

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,240
Are you rebelling?

126
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,360
You used violence

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,780
and abused the people.

128
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,320
I should have

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,010
should have been decided by someone else.

130
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,080
Are you okay?

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm late.

133
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,240
Let's go.
